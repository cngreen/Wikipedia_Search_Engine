Longwall_mining
thumb|250px|Longwall miningLongwall mining is a form of underground mining where a long wall of coal is mined in a single slice (typically 12 m thick). The longwall panel (the block of coal that is being mined) is typically 34 km long and 250400 m wide.Historythumb|250px|right|Plan of longwall mine before conveyors, hoist is at the center of the central pillar.The basic idea of longwall mining was developed in England in the late 17th century. Miners would undercut the coal along the width of the coal face, removing coal as it fell, and using wooden props to control the fall of the roof behind the face.  this was known as the Shropshire method of mining.(Longwall Mining, Office of Coal, Nuclear, Electric and Alternate Fuels, U.S. Department of Energy, March 1995, pages 910.)  While the technology has changed considerably, the basic idea remains the same, to remove essentially all of the coal from a broad coal face and allow the roof and overlying rock to collapse into the void behind, while maintaining a safe working space along the face for the miners.Starting around 1900, mechanization was applied to this method.  By 1940, some referred to longwall mining as the conveyor method of mining, after the most prominent piece of machinery involved.(A. Paxton, J. A. Biggs, Ten Minutes in a Coal Mine, 1940, Pages 16-24)  Unlike earlier longwall mining, the use of a belt parallel to the coal face forced the face to be developed along a straight line.  The only other machinery used was an electric cutter to undercut the coal face and electric drills for blasting to drop the face.  Once dropped, manual labor was used to load coal onto the conveyor parallel to the face and to place wooden roof props to control the fall of the roof.Such low-technology longwall mines continued in operation into the 1970s.  The best known example was the New Gladstone Mine near Iowa one of the last advancing longwall mines in the United States.()  This longwall mine did not even use a conveyor belt, but relied on ponies to haul coal tubs from the face to the slope where a hoist hauled the tubs to the surface.()(The Last Pony Mine, a documentary film, Les Benedict, director, Steve Knudston, producer, 1972.  Available on YouTube in 3 parts part 1part 2part 3)Longwall mining has been extensively used as the final stage in mining old and pillar mines.  In this context, longwall mining can be classified as a form of mining.LayoutGate roads are driven to the back of each panel before longwall mining begins. The gate road along one side of the block is called the maingate or headgate; the road on the other side is called the tailgate.  Where the thickness of the coal allows, these gate roads have been previously developed by continuous miner units, as the longwall itself is not capable of the initial development. In thinner seams the advancing longwall mining method may be used. In this system the gate roads are formed as the coal face advances. Only the maingate road is formed in advance of the face. The tailgate road is formed behind the coal face by removing the stone above coal height to form a roadway that is high enough to travel in. The end of the block that includes the longwall equipment is called the face. The other end of the block is usually one of the main travel roads of the mine. The cavity behind the longwall is called the goaf, goff or gob.VentilationFresh air travels up the main gate, across the face, and then down the tail gate. Once past the face the air is no longer fresh air, but return air carrying away dust and mine gases such as methane, carbon dioxide, depending on the geology of the coal. Return air is extracted by ventilation fans mounted on the surface. A series of seals are erected as mining progresses to maintain goaf gas levels. Typically to avoid coal in the goaf spontaneously combusting, goaf gases are allowed to build up so as to exclude oxygen from the goafed area. This means that there is an explosive goaf fringe between the face and the goaf at all times requiring constant monitoring.Equipmentthumb|Hydraulic chocksA number of jacks, called powered roof supports, chocks or shields, which are typically 1.75 m wide and placed in a long line, side by side for up to 400 m in length in order to support the roof of the coalface. An individual chock can weigh 3040 tonnes, extend to a maximum cutting height of up to 6 m and have yield rating of 10001250 tonnes each, and hydraulically advance itself 1 m at a time. thumb|right|Hydraulic chocks, conveyor and shearerThe coal is cut from the coalface by a machine called the shearer (power loader). This machine can weigh 75120 tonnes typically and comprises a main body, housing the electrical functions, the tractive motive units to move the shearer along the coalface and pumping units (to power both hydraulic and water functions). At either end of the main body are fitted the ranging arms which can be ranged vertically up down by means of hydraulic rams, and onto which are mounted the shearer cutting drums which are fitted 4060 cutting picks. Within the ranging arms are housed very powerful electric motors (typically up to 850 kW) which transfer their power through a series of lay gears within the body the arms to the drum mounting locations at the extreme ends of the ranging arms where the cutting drums are. The cutting drums are rotated at a speed of 2050 revs/min to cut the mineral from coal seam. The shearer is carried along the length of the face on the armoured face conveyor (AFC); using a chain-less haulage system, which resembles a ruggedised rack and pinion system especially developed for mining. Before chainless haulage systems, a heavy duty chain was run the length of the coal face for the shearer to pull itself along. The shearer moves at a speed of 1030 m/min depending on cutting conditions. The AFC is placed in front of the powered roof supports, and the shearing action of the rotating drums cutting into the coal seam disintegrates the coal, this being loaded onto the AFC. The coal is removed from the coal face by a scraper chain conveyor to the main gate. Here it is loaded onto a network of conveyor belts for transport to the surface. At the main gate the coal is usually reduced in size in a crusher, and loaded onto the first conveyor belt by the beam stage loader (BSL).As the shearer removes the coal, the AFC is snaked over behind the shearer and the powered roof supports move forward into the newly created cavity. As mining progresses and the entire longwall progresses through the seam, the goaf increases. This goaf collapses under the weight of the overlying strata. The strata approximately 2.5 times the thickness of the coal seam removed collapses and the beds above settle onto the collapsed goaf. This collapsing can lower surface height, causing problems like changing the course of rivers and severely damage building foundations.Comparison with room and pillar methodLongwall and room and pillar methods of mining can both be used for mining suitable underground coal seams. Longwall has better resource recovery (about 80% compared with about 60% for and pillar method,(Underground Mining) fewer roof support consumables are needed, higher volume coal clearance systems, minimal manual handling and safety of the miners is enhanced by the fact that they are always under the hydraulic roof supports when they are extracting coal.SubsidenceSubsidence is largely immediate, allowing for better planning and more accountability by the mining company.(http://www.sj-r.com/sections/news/stories/85472.asp) There have been cases of surface subsidence altering the landscape above the mines. At Newstan Colliery in South Wales, Australia the surface has dropped by as much as five metres in places above a multi level mine.() In some cases the subsidence causes damage to natural features such as drainage to water courses() or man-made structures such as roads and buildings. Douglas Park Drive was closed for four weeks because longwall panels ... destabilised the road. In 2000, the State Government stopped mining when it came within 600 metres from the twin bridges. A year later there were reports of 40-centimetre gaps appearing in the road, and the bridge had to be jacked sideways to realign it. ( p. 2A 2005 geotechnical report commissioned by the NSW RTA warns that subsidence could happen suddenly and occur over many years.(See also* mining* mining* mining* miningNotesExternal links* University of Wollongong (Australia).

Statistical_classification
In learning, statistical classification is the problem of identifying the sub-population to which new observations belong, where the identity of the sub-population is unknown, on the basis of a set of data containing observations whose sub-population is known. Therefore these classifications will show a variable behaviour which can be studied by statistics.Thus the requirement is that new  individual items are placed into groups based on quantitative information on one or more measurements, traits or characteristics, etc. and based on the training set in which previously decided groupings are already established.The problem here may be contrasted with that for analysis, where the problem is to analyse a single data-set and decide how and whether the observations in the data-set can be divided into groups. In certain terminology, particularly that of  learning, the classification problem is known as learning, while clustering is known as learning. Unfortunately, terminology can be different in various fields of application. For example, in ecology, the term classification is synonymous with analysis. Learning classifiers. Problem statement A learning classifier is able to learn based on a sample. The data-set used for training consists of information x and y for each data-point, where x denotes what is generally a vector of observed characteristics for the data-item and y denotes a group-label. The label y can take only a finite number of values. The classification problem can be stated as follows: given training data \{(x_1,y_1),\dots,(x_n, y_n)\} produce a rule (or classifier) h, such that h(x) can be evaluated for any possible value of x (not just those included in the training data) and such that the group attributed to any new observation, specifically:\hat{y}h(x),is as close as possible to the true group label y. For the training data-set, the true labels yi are known but will not necessarily match their in-sample approximations:\hat{y_i}h(x_i).For new observations, the true labels yj  are unknown, but it is a prime target for the classification procedure that the approximation:\hat{y_j}h(x_j) \approx y_jas well as possible, where the quality of this approximation needs to be judged on the basis of the statistical or probabilistic properties of the overall population from which future observations will be drawn.Frequentist proceduresEarly work on statistical classification was undertaken by Fisher,(Fisher R.A. (1936)  The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems, Annals of Eugenics, 7, 179&ndash;188)(Fisher R.A. (1938)  The statistical utilization of multiple measurements, Annals of Eugenics, 8, 376&ndash;386) in the context of two-group problems, leading to linear discriminant function as the rule for assigning a group to a new observation.(Gnanadesikan, R. (1977) Methods for Statistical Data Analysis of Multivariate Observations, Wiley. ISBN 0-471-30845-5 (p. 83&ndash;86)) This early work assumed that data-values within each of the two groups had a normal distribution. The extension of this same context to more than two-groups has also been considered with a restriction imposed that the classification rule should be linear.((Rao, C.R. (1952) Advanced Statistical Methods in Multivariate Analysis, Wiley. (Section 9c)) Later work for the multivariate normal distribution allowed the classifier to be nonlinear:(Anderson,T.W. (1958) An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis, Wiley.) several classification rules can be derived based on slight different adjustments of the distance, with a new observation being assigned to the group whose centre has the lowest adjusted distance from the observation.Bayesian proceduresUnlike frequentist procedures, Bayesian classification procedures provide a natural way of taking into account any available information about the relative sizes of the sub-populations associated with the different groups within the overall population.(Binder, D.A. (1978) Bayesian cluster analysis, Biometrika, 65, 31&ndash;38.) Bayesian procedures tend to be computationally expensive and, in the days before chain Monte Carlo computations were developed, approximations for Bayesian clustering rules were devised.(Binder, D.A. (1981) Approximations to Bayesian clustering rules, Biometrika, 68, 275&ndash;285.) Some Bayesian procedures involve the calculation of  group membership probabilities: these can be viewed as providing a more informative outcome of a data analysis than a simple attribution of a single group-label to each new observation.Binary and multiclass classificationClassification can be thought of as two separate problems - classification and classification. In binary classification, a better understood task, only two classes are involved, whereas in multiclass classification involves assigning an object to one of several classes.(Har-Peled, S., Roth, D., Zimak, D. (2003) Constraint Classification for Multiclass Classification and Ranking. In: Becker, B., Thrun, S., Obermayer, K. (Eds) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 15: Proceedings of the 2002 Conference, MIT Press. ISBN 0262025507) Since many classification methods have been developed specifically for binary classification, multiclass classification often requires the combined use of multiple binary classifiers. Algorithms The most widely used classifiers are the network (multi-layer perceptron), vector machines, k-nearest neighbours, Gaussian mixture model, Gaussian, Bayes, tree and RBF classifiers.Examples of classification algorithms include:* classifiers** linear discriminant** regression** Bayes classifier** Perceptron*vector machines**squares support vector machines* classifiers* Kernel estimation** k-nearest neighbor* Boosting* Decision trees** forests* Neural networks* networks* Markov models* vector quantization Evaluation Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified. There is no single classifier that works best on all given problems (a phenomenon that may be explained by the no-free-lunch theorem). Various empirical tests have been performed to compare classifier performance and to find the characteristics of data that determine classifier performance. Determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is however still more an art than a science.The measures and recall are popular metrics used to evaluate the quality of a classification system. More recently, operating characteristic (ROC) curves have been used to evaluate the tradeoff between true- and false-positive rates of classification algorithms.As a performance metric, the coefficient has the advantage over simple accuracy in that it is not affected by the relative sizes of the different classes.()Further, it will not penalize an algorithm for simply rearranging the classes.An intriguing problem in recognition yet to be solved is the relationship between the problem to be solved (data to be classified) and the performance of various pattern recognition algorithms (classifiers).Application domainsClassification problems has many applications. In some of these it is employed as a mining procedure, while in others more detailed statistical modeling is undertaken.* vision** imaging and medical image analysis** character recognition** tracking* discovery and development** Toxicogenomics** structure-activity relationship* Geostatistics* recognition* recognition* Biometric identification*classification* natural language processing* classification* Internet engines* scoring* recognitionSee also*testReferencesExternal links* Classifier showdown A practical comparison of classification algorithms.* Statistical Pattern Recognition Toolbox for Matlab.* TOOLDIAG Pattern recognition toolbox.* Library of variable kernel density estimation routines written in C++..* PAL Classification suite written in Java.*  kNN and Potential energy (Applet), of Leicesterde:Klassifikationsverfahren()automatiquestatisticaalgoritmaistatistikja:th:loi bng thng k

Demantoid
Demantoid is the green gemstone variety of the mineral andradite, a member of the garnet group of minerals.  Andradite is a calcium- and iron-rich garnet.  The chemical formula is Ca3Fe2(SiO4)3 with chromium substitution as the cause of the demantoid green color. Ferric iron is the cause of the yellow in the stone.It has the misnomers olivine,(Shipley, Robert M. Dictionary of Gems and Gemology, 5th edition, 1951, Institute of America, pp62-3) and Uralian emerald.In approximately 2003, reports began to circulate in the trade that some Russian Demantoid garnets were being routinely subjected to heat treatment in order to enhance their color.  Such treatment is believed to be performed at relatively low temperatures and is not thought to be detectable by gemmological testing.HistoryWhile garnets have been known since ancient times, the demantoid variety was not discovered until 1853 in Russias  western central Mountains.  The find was about 110 kilometers north, northwest of Ekaterinburg along the Bobrovka River near the village of Elizavetinskoye. This is an alluvial deposit. A second find is 75 km. south of Ekaterinburg on the Chusovaya and Chrisolitka Rivers southwest of  the village of Poldnevaya. Deposits are also found underground up to 3 meters deep in the demantoid placier. There are five deposits of demantoid in this area. Possessing an unusual green color and a dispersion greater than that of diamond, it quickly became a treasured and expensive gemstone.  From the time of the demantoids find until about 1919, they were popular in Russia as the famous Carl Faberg made jewelry with them.  With communist Russia, gems went out of style.  More stones were then found in the Bobrovka River in the 1970s and 1980s. Around 1999 very limited production occurred in the central Ural Mountains.  Many of the stones found then, are for sale today.  Mining takes place along the rivers today, but some mining is still done secretively. A significant new find took place in Namibia in 1996 at what is now dubbed the Green Dragon mine.In addition to the commercially-important deposits in Russia and Namibia, demantoids are also found in other locations including Italy (Val Malenco, Lombardy), Iran (Kerman) and Afghanistan.(Mindat.org)In around 2009, there was a significant discovery of demantoid and andradite garnet in Madagascar.(gia.edu)AppearanceDemantoid by definition is always green, but the exact shade ranges from a very strong yellowish green to nearly the color of a fine emerald.  Many stones have a brownish cast.  Its dispersion (0.057) is unusually high, and this is often visible as fire (rainbow-coloured flashes of light), although in some cases the stones green body colour can render this effect less noticeable. Their luster is adamantine. Demantoid also has a high index of 1.80 to 1.89.Demantoids are generally small, with finished stones generally under   and stones over  are very rare.Stones with more intense green coloration are generelly highly valued, but lighter stones display substantially more fire.  The choice of stone color or fire can therefore be a matter of personal preference, with some preferring the more yellowish-green stones to the green stones.HorsetailsRussian demantoid oftens contain inclusions of chrysotile,(Professional Jeweler Archive: A Horse Tale)  which is a type of asbestos. These fibers radiate out from a very small crystal of chromite. These inclusions are feathery golden threads that tend to curve and resemble the tail of a horse, and are therefore referred to as horsetail inclusions.  In gemology, the presence of such inclusions is regarded as an indication for natural demantoid. If horsetails increase the value of a demantoid is highly questionable, as horsetails might be an interessting inclusion from a gemmological point of view, its an inclusion nonetheless, which reduces the fire and the transperancy of the stone.  The microstructure of some demantoids is believed to be affected by the presence of horsetails (the horsetail typically originates towards the centre of the nodule, with the fibres branching out and radiating towards the surface), whereas horsetail-free demantoids from other sources frequently display flat crystal faces.(GEMS & GEMOLOGY, Fall 1997, p 222-223)References( External links *Mindat with location data*Mineral galleriesbg:cs:Dmantoidfa:ka:pl:Demantoidru:sk:Diamantoiduk:

Grandson,_Switzerland
Grandson is a municipality in the district of Jura-Nord Vaudois in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland.During the Wars, the Bold was defeated near here in the of Grandson on 2 March 1476.HistoryFile:Grandson Menhir.jpg|thumb|left|Menhir near GrandsonThe Grandson family is first mentioned in the second half of the 11th Century as Grancione.  The town was first mentioned around 1100 as de castro Grancione.  Around 1126 it was mentioned as castri Grandissoni and in 1154 it was called apud Grantionem.(Prehistoric settlementsIn May 1895 a farmer discovered a buried underground Menhir weighing about three tons and about  tall in Les Echtelards.  The monolith now stands in the vicinity of the discovery site.  Grandson, however, is better known for its prehistoric lake side settlements.  The site at Corcelettes became well known after 1854, when Frederic Louis Troyon introduced the author Ferdinand Keller to the Corcelettes site in which numerous piles for stilt houses as well as vases were found.  By 1930 seven lake front settlements were identified.  They included: in Corcelettes a large Age site and a smaller one from the Neolithic period, in Les Buttes two more from the Neolithic period, and in Le Repuis, Le stand and Les Tuileries three others that were probably from the Neolithic.  At the last three sites, no artifacts were discovered that could be used to definitively date them.  In 1995 at the Bellerive campsite a Late Neolithic settlement dating from 2741-2488 BC was discovered.()The most important house settlement is at Corcelettes.  The first water correction of 1876 led to the drainage of a large part of the marshy field where the prehistoric village had been.  The Federal Archaeology and History Museum in Lausanne seized the opportunity and started excavations in the following year which dragged on until 1880.  Corcelettes is probably the one Swiss village that supplied the most metal objects from the Bronze Age to different museums and private collections around the world.  In 1881, the stilt field was  in size.  In 1900 it was declared a Swiss heritage site of national significance.  While it legally protected from looting, several thousand square meters of archaeologically important material has been lost due to erosion.  Nevertheless, Corcelettes is one of the best preserved and largest lakeside settlements on Lake Neuchtel.(In 1983 a system of trenches and banks were built to protect the site from weathering.  Between 1983-88 approximately 2,000 wood pieces, of which 14 were from the period 1123-878 BC, were recorded and measured.  Several investigations of the, up to  thick, artifact layers have found not only pottery and some bronze objects, but also organic material (threads, bark, wood, leaves, seeds, etc.) and burnt traces of house walls of wattle.The findings from Corcelettes spread over the whole Bronze Age, but with a clear accumulation at the end of this period in the 9th century BC.  The pottery is often decorated with paintings, tin bands or white incrustation.  Some of the objects include; a small pig sculpture, a coil and terracotta horns, a flute and two sickle wooden handles, horse bits, three bronze vessels (including a basin in a northern Europe style), a broken brooch, a wheel made of ash wood, wheat bread, a bone plate made from pieces of about fifteen human skulls and a dugout canoe made of wood.  A copper bar, hammer, small tools and molds indicate that there was a metal processing and manufacturing shop in the village.(It appears that the village had declined by the Age.  The only Iron Age object was a Certosa type brooch.  From the Roman era only a few bricks and walls have been discovered in the area of the municipality.Medieval GrandsonThe development of Grandson town is closely tied to the castle and its owner, the lords of Grandson.  The family came to power around 1000.  The small settlement is first mentioned around 1100, but is certainly older than that.  Either by 1146 or at least before 1178 the Grandson family supported the foundation of the Benedictine Priory of Saint-Jean, which belonged to the abbey of La Chaise-Dieu in Auvergne.  The family gave the church of Saint-Jean-Baptiste to the priory.  At the same time, they rebuilt the church, with monolithic columns topped with roman capitals.  The choir was enlarged between 130008 and was damaged in a fire in 1378.  It was part of the parish of Giez until 1438 when the priorys church received the rights of a church.()By 1300, the entire town, except on the lake side, was surrounded by walls.  The nearby villages of Provence, Bonvillars, Fiez, Concise and Yvonand were responsible for the maintenance of the walls.  Otto I of Grandson rebuilt the old castle and enlarged it in 1277-1281.  The castle was expanded again in the beginning of the 14th Century.A large fire (probably in 1378, but first documented in 1397) destroyed the castle roof and a large portion of the courtyard.  A Brgergemeinde is first mentioned in 1293, and before 1328 Otto I granted a charter to the town.  On the north side of the church a covered market was built.  In the village of Le Revelin, outside the city walls and close the Giez gate, butchers shops opened.  Otto I promoted the orders and allowed the Franciscans to build a monastery at the western entrance of the town in 1289.  Today only the church tower and some remains of the convent building are visible.  A hospital was built in the second half of the 14th century in todays Rue Basse, near the Gey gate tower, which was destroyed in 1837.  In 1420 the hospital came under the auspices of the town of Grandson.(Battle of GrandsonGrandson.jpg|thumb|The siege of Grandson and the execution of the garrison, illustration by Johann StumpfImage:Pluenderung Grandson.jpg|thumb|Pillage of the Burgundian camp after the battle of Grandson, illustration by Schilling the Elder, 1483In the late 15th Century, Grandson castle belonged to Jacques de Savoie, an ally of Charles the Bold.  In 1475 the castle was taken by the Swiss Confederation.  In late February 1476, Charles the Bold brought a large mercenary army with him together with many heavy cannons.  An army was organized to come to the garrisons relief.  A boat approached the garrison with the news that an army was coming to its relief, but the vessel was unable to approach the fortress closely for fear that it would be hit by Burgundian cannons.  The men in the boat gestured to the defenders in the fortress to inform them that help was on the way, but their gestures were misunderstood, and the garrison decided to surrender.Swiss sources are unanimous in stating that the men only gave up when Charles assured them they would be spared.  The historian Panigarola, who was with Charles, claimed that the garrison had thrown themselves on the mercy of the duke, and it was up to his discretion of what to do with them.  He ordered all 412 men of the garrison to be executed.  In a scene Panigarola described as shocking and horrible and sure to fill the Swiss with dread, all the victims were led past the tent of Charles on 28 February 1476 and hanged from trees, or drowned in the lake, in an execution that lasted four hours.(Panigarola and den Herzog (Galeazzo Maria Sforza) von Orbe, 4 March 1476 as cited in Oechsli ed. Quellenbuch zur Schweizergeschichte, (Zurich: Schulthess, 1901), pp. 2324.)The Swiss had no news of the fate of the garrison and assembled their forces in the hope of lifting the siege.  This army numbered a little over 20,000 men without artillery and probably slightly outnumbered the Burgundians.  On 2 March 1476 the Swiss army approached the forces of Charles near the town of Concise.  Poor reconnaissance left Charles uninformed as to the size and deployment of the Swiss, and he believed that the Swiss vanguard was the entire force sent against him.  The Burgundian knights soon surrounded the Swiss vanguard, but then Charles made a serious mistake.  After brief skirmishing, Charles ordered his cavalry to pull back so the artillery could reduce the Swiss forces before the attacks were renewed.  At this time, the main body of the Swiss emerged from a forest which had hitherto obscured their approach.  The Burgundian army, already pulling back, soon became confused when the second, and larger, body of Swiss troops appeared.  The withdrawal soon turned into a rout when the Burgundian army broke ranks and ran. Few casualties were suffered on either side: the Swiss did not have the cavalry necessary to chase the Burgundians far. At insignificant cost to themselves, the Swiss had humiliated the greatest duke in Europe, defeated one of the most feared armies, and taken a most impressive amount of treasure.  The booty Charles carried with him was most impressive, and included jewellery, silver and gold plate, tapestries and much of Charles artillery. The Swiss initially had little idea of its value. What is probably a small surviving part of this fantastic booty is on display in various Swiss museums today, whilst a few remaining artillery pieces can be seen in the museum of Neuveville, near Neuchtel, Switzerland.(Florens Deuchler, Die Burgunderbeute, q.v.)After the battle, the Swiss troops came upon the bodies of their countrymen still hanging from trees.  An eyewitness, Peterman Etterlin, described the scene: There were found sadly the honorable men still freshly hanging on the trees in front of the castle whom the tyrant had hanged.  It was a wretched, pitiable sight.  There were hung ten or twenty men on one bough.  The trees were bent down and were completely full.  There hanged a father and a son next to each other, there two brothers or other friends.  And there came the honorable men who knew them; who were their friends, cousins and brothers, who found them miserably hanging.  There was first anger and distress in crying and bewailing. ...(Etterlin, Kronika von der loblichen Eidgnoschaft, (Basel: Eckenstien, 1752), pp. 8991.)The ReformationThe forerunners of the Reformation in Grandson included the coup of Guillaume Farel, who had destroyed the altars of the Franciscan church in 1531, and the sermons of the French priest Jean Le Comte.  However, it wasnt until 1554 that the full Reformation spread from Bern to Grandson.  The monastery and property of the Franciscans were divided between Grandson and the cities of Bern and Fribourg.  After the secularization the cloister housed a cemetery until the beginning of the 19th.  The buildings of the Priory of Saint-Jean became the City Hall and school buildings.(Under Bernese rule, the town was administered by a 24-member council, with the first 12 forming a court.Modern GrandsonIn the 19th century major construction projects changed the town and the immediate surroundings.  In 1819, the Franciscan church and the cemetery were moved to Les Collombaires to allow an extension of the Rue Basse to the main road.  In 1890 the foundations of the church were destroyed to allow the creation of a plaza in front of city hall.  In 1858, the city was separated from the lake by a dam which was built for the Yverdon-Biel railway line.  The lakes water level fell in 1879 with the Jura water correction.  The medieval harbor at the west entrance to the town, no longer connected to the lake.  At the end of the 19th Century, new docks were built along with magnificent houses on the new bank including the estate and astronomic observatory of the Vautier family.  The expansion of the main road and their connection with the surrounding road network led to the 1848-55 straightening and widening of the Rue Basse which forced about thirty houses to move back.  On the Palace Square, one of the most remarkable churches of the Evangelical Free Church of the Canton of Vaud was consecrated in 1898.(The income of the residents of Grandson came from agriculture, particularly from livestock raising on slopes of the Mountains, but also from fishing.  The wine production was widespread in the late 19th Century but decreased significantly with the emergence of parasitic diseases.  The major industry in the 19th Century was tobacco processing.  The main tobacco procession company was Vos, Decoppet. & Cie., which was headquartered in the castle.  In 1831, it was taken over by the H. Vautier & Cie. company.  The wealthy Vautier family were closely involved in local politics and between 1899 and 1914, they held the mayors office.  Their factory at the west entrance of the city was closed in 1972.  In addition, there were various companies in the construction industry (Herren Frres & Cie., Beati Frres SA), Transport, Civil engineering (1896 Landi, 1920 Cand, merged in 1974 into Cand-Landi SA) and construction materials (Les Sables La Poissine Graviers & SA) in town.

It has a population of about 6,730 (June 2010), most of whom live in the mining towns.Most of the land in Ashburton is taken up by leases.  Other industries important to Ashburton include ore mining, oil, gas, fishing and tourism. Ashburton also contains the National Park. ClimateThe climate of Ashburton is dry and very hot.  Mean maximum daily temperatures range from 24C (75F) in July to 41C (106F) in January.  Average annual rainfall is just 280 millimetres (11 in), but can vary from less than 25 millimetres (1 in) to almost 1,000 millimetres (40 in) in years when several cyclones hit.HistoryThe Shire has its origins in two early road districts: Ashburton (1887), based in Onslow, and Tableland (1896), based in the Range. Both became shires on 1 July 1961 under the Local Government Act 1960.On 27 May 1972 the two merged to form the Shire of West Pilbara, which was renamed Shire of Ashburton in December 1987.(WA Electoral Commission, Municipality Boundary Amendments Register (release 3.0), 31 May 2007.)WardsThe Shire is divided into 6 wards, most with one councillor:* Tom Price (3 councillors)* Paraburdoo (2 councillors)* Ashburton * Onslow* Pannawonica* TablelandTowns* Tom Price, the administrative centre* Paraburdoo* Onslow* Pannawonica* WittenoomReferencesFurther reading* (1993) Ashburton Shire - brief history, named Shire of Ashburton 18 Dec. 1987 with the main offices in Tom Price, crest described Shire of Ashburton directory, 1993, p. 13External links* Shire of AshburtonShiredAshburtondi Ashburtonof AshburtonShirezh:

William_A._H._Loveland
250px|right|thumb|William A.H. Loveland from a 19th century engravingWilliam Austin Hamilton Loveland (May 30, 1826&ndash;1894) was a U.S. railroad entrepreneur and businessman in the late 19th century. An early resident of Golden when it was the capital of the Territory, he was one of the founders of the Central Railroad and a principal figure in the early history of Colorado. As president of the Colorado Central, he was instrumental in the expansion of the railroad network into the mining communities of Colorado. For much of the 1870s Loveland waged a fierce struggle with Union Pacific investors for control of the Colorado Central. He also served as Lt. Governor of Colorado. BiographyHis father was the Rev. Leonard Loveland, a prominent Methodist minister and of war in the of 1812. As a young man, Loveland served in the War, serving as a wagonmaster with the Volunteers. Serving in the battles of Veracruz and Puebla, Loveland was severely wounded in the of Chapultepec, and was returned to the United States as an invalid. Upon recovery, Loveland entered the mercantile business in Illinois, and married Phelena Shaw in 1853. After she died a couple years later, Loveland remarried, to Miranda Ann Montgomery.In 1859 Loveland joined the Gold Rush, and helped establish the town of the Golden in the Territory and went into the mercantile business there, building the towns first storefront and second building. After the formation of the Colorado Territory in 1861, he was instrumental in helping establish the territorial capital at Golden. He offered the use of his building, which also was a public hall that was central to the towns activities, to the House of Representatives while another in the same block served the Council (Senate). When most of Goldens leading citizens left to fight in the Civil War, Loveland kept the languishing town alive. At the height of the depression Loveland built the towns first brick storefront in 1863 to house his mercantile business, the Loveland Block, now considered to be the oldest existing commercial brick structure in Colorado. The building also served to house first Masonic Lodge in Colorado and was expanded in 1866 to accommodate both houses the Colorado Territorial Legislature, which met there until the capital was moved to Denver in 1867. The Territorial Library and possibly Territorial Supreme Court were also housed there.In the 1860s, Loveland became an enthusiastic promoter of building a railroad west of Golden through the Mountains, with the idea that Golden would become a great railroad metropolis of the region. In the early 1860s he began purchasing right-of-way in the canyon west of Golden. In 1864, he helped found the Colorado, Clear Creek and Pacific Railway (later Colorado Central Railroad) with the intention of building a rail line the mining communities, and connecting it to the transcontinental railroad that was to be built to the north across present-day Wyoming. Lovelands early efforts to build a railroad were hampered by a lack of funds, as well as a fierce struggle for control of the railroad itself. In the meantime, in 1867, the territorial capital was moved to Denver, and in 1870, the rival Pacific Railway completed its line between Denver and Cheyenne, cementing Denver as the future metropolis of Colorado. Loveland and his partners had to settle for connecting Golden to the Denver Pacific line. It was not until 1877 that the company was able to construct its own direct line from Golden (via Boulder and Fort Collins) to Cheyenne. After the completion of the line, the new city of Colorado was founded in Larimer County along the route and named in his honor. Pass in the Rockies west of Golden is also named for him.In 1870, Loveland was instrumental in persuading the Colorado Territorial Legislature to authorize funds for the establishment of the School of Mines in Golden. He later served on the Board of Trustees of the School of Mines after the Episcopal Church sold it to the Territory in 1874.Loveland was one of the most prominent philanthropists his area has known, whose contributions also helped build the community. Loveland gave land for three schools in Golden, and six churches including the Methodist (3rd church in Colorado), Baptist (oldest church of its faith in Colorado), Episcopalian, of Christ, Presbyterian, and Lutheran (first Swedish immigrant church in Colorado). He regularly lent his hall for public events, community organizations and governmental entities, including the municipal, county and Territorial governments.As Mayor of Golden (187475), Loveland ordered the Golden firefighters to the aid of City, Colorado when it was stricken by fire in 1874. Considered the first mutual aid call in Colorado history, the Golden firemen, arriving by the railroad, succeeded in saving the upper part of the city.In 1878 Loveland became the second owner of the Mountain News, purchasing it from founder N. Byers. At that time Loveland moved to Denver, but kept an active role in Goldens affairs.In 1889, in partnership with Charles Welch, Loveland platted a new 13-block country town along Colfax Avenue west of Denver. The town, called Lakewood, would eventually grow to Colorados fourth largest municipality by 1990. It was laid out along the new mass transit line Loveland helped spearhead in 1890, the Denver, Lakewood & Golden Railway. Loveland moved to Lakewood in 1889.Loveland died in 1894 in Lakewood and was buried in Denvers Fairmount Cemetery. Lovelands mercantile business founded in 1859 continued until 1978 as one of the longest-lived businesses in Colorado history. His earliest Colorado residence, the Loveland Cottage in Golden, which he purchased from a town attorney, still stands at 717 12th Street. The Loveland Block, also a designated historic landmark at 1122 Washington Avenue, is listed on the Register of Historic Places. His Lakewood home, built in 1888 at 1435 Harlan Street, also still stands. Loveland had two sons, Francis William and William Leonard, and an adopted daughter, Jennie Froggatt Loveland.

Sedan_(nuclear_test)
File:Sedan Plowshare Crater.jpg|thumb|300px|The Crater Storax Sedan was a shallow underground nuclear test conducted in 10 of Flat at the National Security Site on 6 July 1962 as part of Plowshare, a program to investigate the use of weapons for mining, cratering, and other civilian purposes.() The radioactive fallout from the test contaminated more US residents than any other nuclear test, and the Crater is the largest man-made crater in the United States, and is listed on the Register of Historic Places.EffectsSedan was a thermonuclear device with a fission yield less than 30% and a fusion yield about 70%.(United States Nuclear Tests; July 1945 through September 1992, DOE/NV--209-REV 15 December 2000, p. xv.http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf) The timing of the test put it within the Storax fiscal year, but Sedan was functionally part of Operation Plowshare, and the test protocol was sponsored and conducted by Livermore National Laboratory with minimal involvement by the States Department of Defense. The explosive device was lowered into a shaft drilled into the desert alluvium  deep.( The fusion-fission blast had a yield equivalent to 104 kilotons of TNT (435 terajoules) and lifted a dome of earth 290 feet (90 m) above the desert floor before it vented at three seconds after detonation, exploding upward and outward displacing more than  of soil.() The resulting crater is  deep with a diameter of about . A circular area of the desert floor five miles across was obscured by fast-expanding dust clouds moving out horizontally from the base surge, akin to surge.(Nevada Test Site Office. Library. Films. Historical Test Films) The blast caused seismic waves equivalent to an earthquake of 4.75 on the Richter scale.( The radiation level on the crater lip at 1 hour after burst was 500 R per hour (130 mC/(kgh)).FalloutImage:Sedan-Smallboy dose.png|thumb|US counties that measured the highest levels of radioactive fallout from both Sedan and Small Boy of Sunbeam, detonated eight days later.  Units are millisieverts.thumb|The ten highest radiation exposures to residents from US continental nuclear testingThe Sedan shot resulted in a radioactive cloud that separated into two plumes, rising to 3.0 km and 4.9 km (10,000 ft and 16,000 ft). The two plumes headed northeast and then east in roughly parallel paths towards the Atlantic Ocean.(The Utah Democratic Progressive Caucus. Press Releases. Nuclear Testing Packet) A large amount of fallout was dropped along the way, narrowly dispersed in a relatively small number of United States counties. Detected radioactivity was especially high in eight counties in Iowa and one county each in Nebraska, South Dakota and Illinois. Most heavily affected counties were Howard, Mitchell and Worth counties in Iowa, as well as Washabaugh County in South Dakota, an area that has since been incorporated into Jackson County and is wholly within Ridge Indian Reservation. These four counties measured maximum levels higher than 6,000 microcuries per square meter (220 MBq/m2).()Of all the nuclear tests conducted in the USA, Sedan ranked highest in overall activity of radionuclides in fallout. The test released 880,000 curies (33 PBq) of radioactive iodine-131, an agent of thyroid disease, into the atmosphere.(National Cancer Institute. National Institute of Health. History of the Nevada Test Site and Nuclear Testing Background) Sedan ranked first in percentages of these particular radionuclides detected in fallout: 198Au, 199Au, 7Be, 99Mo, 147Nd, 203Pb, 181W, 185W and 188W. Sedan ranked second in these radionuclides in fallout: 57Co, 60Co and 54Mn. Sedan ranked third in the detected amount of 24Na in fallout. In countrywide deposition of radionuclides, Sedan was highest in the amount of 7Be, 54Mn, 106Ru and 242Cm, and second highest in the amount of deposited 127mTe.( Sedans fallout contamination contributed a little under 7% to the total amount of radiation which fell on the U.S. population during all of the nuclear tests at NTS. Sedans effects were similar to shot George of Tumbler-Snapper, detonated on June 1, 1952, which also contributed about 7% to the total radioactive fallout. Uncertainty regarding exact amounts of exposure prevents knowing which of the two nuclear tests was the most; George is listed as being the highest exposure and Sedan second highest by the States Department of Health and Human Services, for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Cancer Institute.(Report on the Feasibility of a Study of the Health Consequences to the American Population from Nuclear Weapons Tests Conducted by the United States and Other Nations, Vol 1.

Technical Report. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Cancer Institute. May 2005)ConclusionsThe Plowshare project developed the Sedan test in order to determine the feasibility of using nuclear detonations to quickly and economically excavate large amounts of dirt and rock. Proposed applications included the creation of harbors, canals, open pit mines, railroad and highway cuts through mountainous terrain and the construction of dams. Assessment of the full effects of the Sedan shot showed that the radioactive fallout from such uses would be extensive. Public concerns about the health effects and a lack of political support eventually led to abandonment of the concept.(Center for Digital Discourse and Culture, Virginia Tech. U.S. Nuclear Testing from Project Trinity to the Plowshare Program Abby A. Johnson. (1986)) No such nuclear excavation has since been undertaken by the US,(Nevada Test Site Office. Library. Factsheets. Plowshare Program) though the Soviet Union continued to pursue the concept through their program Explosions for the National Economy.Misunderstanding in 2005On March 2, 2005  Tauscher, a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing the state of California, gave congressional testimony on the containment of nuclear testing debris, using the Sedan test as an example of one which produced a considerable amount of radioactive fallout. The word Sedan was incorrectly transcribed as Sudan in the Record. Within days of the error, the international community took notice.  Sudanese officials responded to this stating that the Sudanese government takes this issue seriously and with extreme importance, and Chinas General News Service even went so far as to publish an article claiming that the Sudanese government had blamed the U.S. for raising cancer rates among the Sudanese people.() Despite the U.S. embassy in Khartoum issuing a statement regarding the error, the Sudanese Foreign Minister, Mustafa Osman Ismail, stated that they would continue investigating.()See also*(nuclear test)*nuclear explosionsReferencesExternal links*US government movie about the Sedan test* Sedan Underground Nuclear Test video * Virtual-Reality tour of Sedan Site*Sedan Crater at the Online Nevada Encyclopedia(prova nuclear)(krter)(Kernwaffentest)(prueba nuclear)ja:(test nuklearny)Sedan

Post_scarcity
Post scarcity (also styled post-scarcity or postscarcity) is a hypothetical form of economy or society, in which things such as goods, services and information are free, or practically free. This would be due to an abundance of fundamental resources (matter, energy and intelligence), in conjunction with sophisticated automated systems capable of converting materials into finished goods, allowing manufacturing to be as easy as duplicating software. The scarcity problem Scarcity is the fundamental economic problem of having seemingly unlimited human needs and wants, in a world of limited resources. It states that society has insufficient productive resources to fulfill all human wants and needs. Alternatively, scarcity implies that not all of societys goals can be pursued at the same time; trade-offs are made of one good against others. As such, the term post-scarcity economics may be somewhat paradoxical. To quote a 1932 essay by Robbins, economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.(, p. 16)Although some argue that already there exists enough energy, raw materials and biological resources to provide a comfortable lifestyle for every person on Earth,(Press Release United Nations Environment Programme - Cutting Food Losses from Farm to Kitchen and Converting Wastes into Animal Feeds a Key Opportunity.

(It is usually assumed there would still be plenty of voluntary creative labor, such as a writer creating a novel,  a software engineer working on software, or an editor creating or modifying some types of wiki pages and other content.) There are some exceptions to this use of the term. For example, Giddens, uses post-scarcity to refer to a set of trends he sees in modern industrialized nations, such as an increased focus on life politics and a decreased focus on productivity and economic growth. Giddens acknowledges that the term has also been used historically to mean a literal end of scarcity.Most Marxists envision later phases of a worldwide communist society as a form of post-scarcity society.MeansSpeculative technologyMost visions of post-scarcity societies assume the existence of new technologies which make it much easier for society to produce nearly all goods in great abundance, given raw materials and energy. More speculative forms of nanotechnology (such as assemblers or nanofactories) raise the possibility of devices that can automatically manufacture any specified goods given the correct instructions and the necessary raw materials and energy.(Engines of Creation (full text online, see also of Creation) - Drexler, Eric K., Anchor Books, 1986) Even before that level of technology can be achieved, labs and advanced industrial automation might be able to produce most physical goods that people desire, with a minimal amount of human labor required.(As for the raw materials and energy needed as input for such automated production systems, self-replicating mining plants set loose in the belt (see mining) or other areas of space with huge amounts of untapped raw materials could cause the prices of these materials to plummet. New power sources such as power or power satellites could do the same for energy, especially if the power plants/power satellites could themselves be constructed in a highly automated way, so their number would be limited only by raw materials and energy.(Digital abundanceTraditionally, creators have used (and continue to use) raw materials to instantiate their works: a painter might use oil and canvas, a sculptor might work in clay, an architect might draft designs in pen and ink. Such work would result in a single copy (or artifact). While mass reproduction of such works (impressions)  by processes such as printmaking or photocopying  is possible and common, such reproduction still incurs appreciable costs (for example for the paper used, and for the physical distribution of the copy).Where the artifact can be captured digitally, copies have minimal reproduction costs. The same painter could create an original work with software; the sculptor might use prototyping, digital manufacturing, and printing; the architect CAD/CAM tools. Most of the cost in such works is in paying for the original design and development (but most of it goes too to distribution, administration and production, thereby the artist being paid only a minimal amount of what the enterprise really produces)  for the creators expertise and for their tools (though these also do not wear out the same way physical tools do). While the creators of such works must still labor to create the design matrix, there are virtually no raw-materials required to recreate the work once completed.This negligible-cost reproduction raises the question, How much should one pay for something that can be copied near-indefinitely at minimal expense? Does a purchaser have the right to reproduce their own copy as much as they can afford to? Some people believe the purchaser does not or should not have any rights to copy or transfer ownership, and use Rights Management to try to enforce this view. Others instead feel that information should be freely distributed (see copyleft), and that DRM measures are attempts to restore prior business models viability by inducing scarcity.Many advocates of source software and software attempt to collaboratively create software programs which are intended to offer similar capabilities to their software competitors, but with the code made public and permission granted for users to freely copy the software. Stallman, the founder of the project which designed the Free software GNU system, and co-founder of the software movement, has explicitly cited the eventual creation of a post-scarcity society as one of his motivations:(GNU Manifesto (full text online, see also Manifesto) - Stallman, Richard; Dobbs Journal, March 1985)EffectsEconomic paradigmMarket economies or planned economies may be unnecessary in a post-scarcity age, though gift or exchange economies may take their place once the scarcity driving earlier types of economy disappears.(The Gift Economy - Vaughan, Genevieve, magazine, 1990)(The Hacker Culture as Gift Economy (full text online, see also the Noosphere) - Raymond, Eric S., April 1998) Post-scarcity societies might also have their market economies limited to the exchange of energy and resources, or of other scarce or even non-material things, such as status or reputation (see Whuffie for a fictional example), real estate, or skills and expertise.Many science-fiction variants also imagine the very concept of ownership to weaken or disappear,(Various novels set in the Culture universe - Banks, Ian M.; 1987-2000) as people lose attachment to all but sentimental-value items, knowing that they will always be able to receive or create replacements. Monetary systems in consequence also cease to be a factor. Many stories depict these changes as a positive advancement, freeing humanity from both toil and greed. Others posit that handing production and most other services over to machines and computers will stunt the spirit of humanity, or even lead to a loss of control over humanitys own fate, e.g., Jack Williamsons Folded Hands.Unavoidable scarcitySome things will remain rare even in a post-scarcity society. There is a practical limit to the number of people who can live in any specific, in-demand locale. However, hypothetical machines such as a nanofactory are envisioned as being able to produce any real-world artifact, and some fictions even envision the physical creation of new living space (orbitals( or ringworlds(Various novels from the Ringworld series - Niven, Larry; 1970-2004)) to reduce this scarcity. This would likely further reduce (though not fully abolish) the value of an original item or a specific locale to live in. Engineers have suggested megascale structures such as an disk or sphere to provide abundant living space and energy.Population growth, if it continues long enough, may also lead to unavoidable scarcity. As pointed out by Robert Malthus, Ehrlich, Bartlett, and others, growth in human population has the capacity to overwhelm any finite supply of resources, even the entire known universe, in a remarkably short time. For example, if the human population could continue to grow indefinitely at its 1994 rate, in 1,900 years the mass of the human population would equal the mass of Earth, and in 6000 years the mass of the human population would equal the estimated mass of the observable universe() Although this would imply the invention of faster than light travel, necessary for humanity to spread throughout the universe as fast as population growth, even at lower growth rates these levels would still be reached in readily imaginable times.  It is therefore difficult to conceive of a credible post scarcity scenario which does not also imply population growth or relatively low population growth, even though possible future technologies such as self-replicating spacecraft could theoretically maintain exponential growth far beyond earths carrying capacity.At present, the fertility rate is high in poor countries with poor health infrastructure, but it tends to drop to replacement levels or lower once a nation reaches a per capita income of roughly $10,000.(http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:TFR_vs_PPP_2009.svg) In fact, virtually every wealthy OECD nation currently has a total fertility rate that is below replacement levels, implying a coming population decline for the west. Due to the decline in fertility that tends to accompany wealth (of the 233 countries listed by the CIA for fertility, 100 have fertility rates below replacement rates), human population is expected to stabilize at near 9 billion by 2050.(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World-Population-1800-2100.png)FictionUtopiasFictional post-scarcity societies include varied settings, such as Queendom of Sol in the series of the same name by McCarthy, the Festival  and agalmic economics from Sky and Accelerando by Stross, and the Federation of Planets from the Trek series.One of the earliest treatments of a transition to a post-scarcity society occurs in Pandoras Millions by O. Smith, in which the development of a matter duplicator that can replicate almost any scannable object causes an economic collapse, and a return to a economy for the only remaining scarce resource: Skilled human labor. Chaos ensues until the inventors of the matter duplicator discover a substance that explodes when scanned by the duplicator beam. This new substance, Identium, serves as a new of exchange for skilled labor, in a post-scarcity society otherwise primarily devoted to the pursuit of leisure, science, art, the occasional lawsuit, and the sale and exchange of Certified Uniques  objects whose chain of provenance can legally establish that they have never been scanned by a duplicator beam.Stanley Robinsons trilogy describes the beginning development of a highly automated society whose economy was to be based on caloric input/output and had only a few materials valued based on their scarcity. However, the inherent problems of such a system (such as its remaining capitalist elements or the difficulty in fixing the worth of academic work) are not resolved within the timeframe depicted in the trilogy.An intermediate step to a post-scarcity society is shown in Stephensons Diamond Age, where fabricator technology allows the growth of any item that one has design plans for - however, the poor receive a lesser amount of energy and resources per day to use, and thus have to wait longer for their items to be fabricated. Also, their items tend to be smaller, as they have no access to large-scale fabricators. This system, fueled by a centrally-distributed matter feed is eventually replaced by the protean seed, which is able to take in raw materials from its environment to develop into whatever its program dictates.  No longer bound to the aristocratically-controlled feeds, the society moves to a post-scarcity economy.James P. Hogan has written several works where post-scarcity plays a major role. from Yesteryear details the society of the Chironians, embryo colonists of Centauri who have adopted such a lifestyle. Cradle of Saturn and its sequel The Anguished Dawn is mostly told from the perspective of the Kronians, a pseudo-religion who colonize Saturns largest satellite in the process of developing such a society. Both stories are driven by the difficulties of changing an existing economic paradigm, and postulate that a fresh start may be necessary to overcome old thinking about money and possessions.Rucker also dealt with this jarring transition in Realware in which humans receive an alien device that can instantiate any consumer product they have seen. This leads to a breakdown of the market, with stores blacking out their windows in a vain attempt to prevent people from copying their products. Still, people who do buy the products find them instantly copied once out on the streets.Iain M. Banks Culture stories center around an advanced spacefaring civilization that has used intelligences to provide extremely abundant (and in daily practice unlimited) amounts of goods and services using advanced technology, describing a fully post scarcity society, which also attempts to influence other galactic societies towards the advanced cultural stage that freedom from greed and material need has allowed it. As Banks puts it in a 1994 article, nothing and nobody in the Culture is exploited. It is essentially an automated civilisation in its manufacturing processes, with human labour restricted to something indistinguishable from play, or a hobby.John C. Wrights novel The Golden Age deals with a future voluntary libertarian society spanning the solar system called the Golden Oecumene. Due to technology, nearly everyone is immortal and tremendously wealthy except those living outside society due to exile or by choice.  The Sophotechs, a superior line of computer intelligences, do most of the work, research, and simulations required by the society.  Throughout the book the main character, Phaethon, has to face off against a technologically superior and unknown enemy while also dealing with a post-scarcity society which is afraid of death and instability more than anything else and does not believe his plight.In the short novel Manna(http://www.marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm), Brain writes of a dystopian society ruined by advanced robotics as well as a utopian society enabled by it.  The protagonist escapes life in a government run dormitory because his father bought shares in the fictional Australia Project.DystopiasThere have also been fully dystopian science fiction societies where all peoples physical needs are provided for by machines, but this causes humans to become overly docile, uncreative and incurious. Examples include M. Forsters 1909 short story Machine Stops, Vonneguts Piano, Herberts Dune, and C. Clarkes 1956 novel City and the Stars. of the Purple Wage, Jos Farmers dystopian 1967 science fiction novella also explores some ramifications of a future wherein technology allows everyones desires to be met. Webers Harrington saga has the example of the Republic of Haven, in which each citizen is due a Basic Living Stipend. With most of their population on the dole, productivity and their economy collapse. In Frederik Pohls Midas Plague, resources and luxuries are so common, that the poor must bear the burden of consuming and disposing of the bounty, as well as working at meaningless jobs to produce more meaningless plenty; the rich, conversely, are allowed to live simple but comfortable lifestyles. In Lems Cyberiad, a central motif is unbounded progress of technology. In The Highest Possible Level of Development civilization, the inhabitants have become passive, and the visitors have to shoo away machines trying to comfort them. In Wells Time Machine, the Time Traveller speculates, based on the Eloi, that mankind had been armed with a perfected science which reduced all dangers in nature, epitomized by the quote: Strength is the outcome of need.  The 2008 Pixar film WALL-E also depicts what appears to be a post-scarcity dystopia, albeit humorously imagined.See also* development* economy* S.

West_Rainton
West Rainton is a village and parish in Durham, England. It is situated between Durham and Houghton-le-Spring. Leamside is about  to the west. The village straddles a ridge parallel to the A690 with extensive views to the west. HistoryThe naming of the township was for one of the seven monks who followed the body of St. Cuthbert from Lindisfarne to Durham. Spellings of this name Reingwald have included Reynington, Reynoton, Reynton, and Rayntona.()The area belonging to the Prior and convent of Durham and was densely wooded, a park keeper being recorded as appointed in 1338. In 1657 Richard Marshall assigned a tenement and farm holding in West Rainton to Marmaduke Allenson. It then passed into the hands of West Raintons more famous son  Sir John Duck, Baronet  a Dick Whittington of the North East of England. He owned and built Rainton Hall around the year 1688.The following is from History, Topography and Directory of Durham, Whellan, London, 1894;  The village of West Rainton is about four miles north-east of Durham, and formerly contained an ancient chapel with chantry dedicated to the Virgin Mary; some of the old stones may be seen in the different buildings in the village. The Old Hall, situated in the centre of the village, was built about 1690, by Sir Jno. Buck, now in a state of dilapidation, and let in tenements occupied by pitmen. There is a library, reading, and news-room here. There are two batteries of the Second Durham Artillery Volunteers, having a drill-hall here, built by the Marquess of Londonderry in 1880, the headquarters being at Seaham Harbour.St. Marys ChurchSaint Marys church built 1864 has a  spire added in 1877 that is a prominent feature of the area visible for many miles. The spire was gifted by Sir George Elliot in memory of his daughter Elizabeth.  A large granite tablet was used to record this donation and was of special interest being taken from the great pyramid of Ghizeh in Egypt with the permission of the Khedive at that time.()  The church is a substantial building able to seat 500 worshippers. Previously an ancient chapel stood near.Coal miningmining in the area is mentioned as early as the 12th century. In Whellans 1894 Directory of County Durham some 1185 men and boys were employed in the Adventure, Alexandrina and Meadow pits sunk between 1817 and 1824. The coals produced were Londonderry Wallsend, Pittington Wallsend, and Londonderry Primrose, for household purposes, and the Hartley for steam purposes. The Adventure pit employed 389 people at its peak in 1940. Much of the newer housing in the village dates from the 1950s and was built to house the workforce for the pit as there was little other employment available locally.  Although no disasters, (i.e. pit accidents resulting in five or more deaths) were reported at Adventure, 23 lost their lives there.(). The pit was closed in 1978.(Nearby, the line railway, now disused, is still in place.()Local facilitiesA mile to the west can be found the remains of Priory sacked by Henry VIII during the of the Monasteries.To the south, in a wooded area is an area owned by the Moor House scouts group. It is a  site providing accommodation and adventure challenges and sleeps up to 38 youngsters.()GalleryImage:StMaryWR1.JPG|St Marys churchImage:WRaintonPO.JPG|West Rainton Post OfficeImage:MasonsWR.JPG|Masons ArmsImage:WRaintonCommon.JPG|The CommonImage:1NorthSt.JPG|North Street CottageImage:StMaryWR2.JPG|St Marys church from southImage:WestRaintonSchoolRH.JPG|West Rainton Primary SchoolExternal links* Census information References RaintonRainton

Neath_(UK_Parliament_constituency)
towns        Neath, PontardaweNeath (Welsh: Castell-nedd) is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the of the United Kingdom. It elects one of Parliament (MP) by the past the post system of election and one Assembly Member by the past the post system of election. The Constituency of Neath The constituency is located in the preserved county of Glamorgan, Wales.  It consists of the electoral wards of: Aberdulais, Allt-wen, Blaengwrach, Bryn-cch North, Bryn-cch South, Cadoxton, Cimla, Crynant, Cwmllynfell, Dyffryn, Glynneath, Graig, Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen, Brynamman, East, North, South, Onllwyn, Pelenna, Pontardawe, Resolven, Rhos, Seven Sisters, Tonna, Trebanos, Ystalyfera.The Neath constituency is a mixture of both industrial and rural communities, running in a north-south strip along the dips, ridges and folded landscape of Wales. It includes most of the Neath and Dulais valleys, and some of the Upper Swansea Valley as well. The town of Neath is at its southern end and is a medium-sized town which started life as a Roman Nidum. The constituency boasts historical places of both industrial and natural forms. Neath and the surrounding areas were industrialised very early in Britains history. Copper smelting was already happening here in the late sixteenth century.When Abbey (now a magnificent ruin) was founded in 1129, it was the richest of all Welsh monasteries, and in writings of the sixteenth century was described as the fairest Abbey of all Wales. At its height it owned extensive lands and property, from Glamorgan to Somerset; had almost 5,000 sheep, as well as horses and cattle; it owned a ship and a landing-place, and worked mills, fisheries and coal-mines. But it suffered greatly during the many skirmishes between the Welsh and English (or Normans), and by the 1530s had only eight monks left. The ruins date mostly from the late thirteenth century. It has been in turn, a prosperous Abbey, a Jacobean Mansion (painted by Turner), an iron foundry (which explains the Abbeys position in the middle of an industrial area) and now an historical monument.The constituency was heavily mined and the small communities that grew up around these mines were devastated by the collapse of the mining industry in the 1980s. On the edges of many of these communities there are now Industrial Villages springing up, helping to replace the jobs lost by the demise of the mining industry, and so helping to keep young people in these communities.(Neath Port Talbot council)A legacy to Neaths political history is the memorial stone in Victoria Gardens to the 5 Neath citizens killed during the Spanish Civil War of 1936-38.The constituency remains a Welsh-speaking area, with approximately 26% of the population reported as Welsh speakers.

Hutton Henry is a village in Durham, in England. It is situated to the west of Hartlepool, near the villages of Wingate and Town.In ca. 1050 the village was known as Hoton. Henry de Essh held it in the 14th century, providing the second part of the name.() During the 19th century it was a mining village, as were the nearby villages of Wingate and Station Town. Its population increased from 156 in 1801 to 3,151 in 1891 due to the opening of collieries.() Hutton Henry colliery was operational between 1876 and 1897 and was owned by Hutton Henry Coal Co. Ltd. In 1894 its average output was about 190,000 tons per annum, and it was said to employ 1,000 men and boys..()ReferencesExternal linksHenry

Mordru
Mordru (also known as Mordru the Merciless) is a fictional character, a supervillain in the Comics main shared universe.()Mordru is the most prominent Lord of Chaos who is fated to survive even after the end of the universe, although he is usually shown as a powerful wizard. While he is sometimes depicted as a present adversary of the Society of America and the Lord of Order Amethyst, Mordrus primary foes are the of Super-Heroes in the future world of the 30th and 31st centuries.  He is arguably the teams most powerful enemy.Fictional character biographyPre-Crisis (20th century)In the continuity which existed prior to the on Infinite Earths miniseries, Mordrus first chronological battle with costumed superheroes occurred during one of the numerous meetings between Earth-Ones Justice League of America and Earth-Twos Society of America.  At the time, the two teams helped the of Super-Heroes (who hailed from Earth-Ones 30th century) to defeat the wizard.(Justice League of America #147-148 (1977))  While these events are seemingly erased following Crisis on Infinite Earths, they are restored to continuity by the events of Crisis,(As revealed in Action Comics #864) with the JLA and JSA as inhabitants of a combined New Earth.Post-Crisis (20th and 21st centuries)After Crisis on Infinite Earths, Mordru was recast as a timeless Lord of Chaos, and became a major foe of the JSA.  He made several attempts to take the power of Doctor Fate for himself, and was imprisoned in Fates amulet for a time. When he escaped, he subdued Hector Hall, stealing Halls collar and amulet and taking on the familiar garb of Doctor Fate.(Mordru attempted to conquer the world (with the assistance of Eclipso and Obsidian), but was defeated by Doctor Fate and the JSA.(  Fate imprisoned Mordru within the Rock of Eternity, where he was guarded by the wizard Shazam.  Yet Mordru eventually managed to escape, mere moments before the Spectre (having been seduced by the Loring-hosted Eclipso) arrived and murdered Shazam.  Mordrus appearance in that story arc, Princes of Darkness, is of continuity-interest because his defeat involved freeing the soul of Atlantean sorcerer Arion, who revealed that he was in fact not the grandfather of Girl, a foreshadowing of her backstory revisions to come in the Crisis story.After escaping the Rock of Eternity and briefly battling Shazam, Mordru promptly sought revenge on Fate and the JSA. While fighting Fate, the two were thrown into different timelines, such as the Kingdom Come timeline. Fate mocked Mordru, claiming that he was a cosmic fluke, a cancer, and that no other versions of him existed anywhere. Mordru was then defeated by Thunder, who placed him somewhere where none of us will see him again.Mordru returned to possess the body of Doctor Fate, only to be cast out and take on his actual form when Fates teammates see through the facade, in Justice Society of America (vol. 2) #34.Image:NabuMordru.png|thumb|250px|left|Mordru battles the JSA and the hostless Nabu in JSA #80. Art by Kramer.GemworldHe also played a prominent role in the history of Gemworld, where he began his existence as Wrynn, one of the twin sons of Lord Topaz and Lady Turquoise. Wrynn became entranced by the study of black magic as he grew older and during a summoning ritual he had been performing, he accidentally resurrected the gemstone golem called Flaw, servant of the Child, one of the Lords of Chaos. Flaw chose Wrynn as the instrument of the Lords of Chaos plans to retake Gemworld and transformed him, granting him tremendous magical power and renamed him Mordru. During a battle with Princess of Gemworld, Mordru murdered his twin brother, Donal and was later sentenced with banishment from the Twelve Kingdoms of Gemworld after his defeat. However, Amethyst, not satisfied with this decree and angered over Donals senseless murder, banished Mordru into Gemworld itself, literally merging him with the planet, where he remained for many years. This led to him developing taphephobia (the fear of being buried alive), a weakness that was often his downfall thereafter.(Amethyst  Vol.3 #1-4 (November 1987 - February 1988))Pre-Zero Hour (30th Century)The bulk of Mordrus appearances are in the 30th century, where he rises in power to become one of the most powerful figures in the universe, and indeed at sometimes arguably the most powerful.  Because of various reboots to 30th century continuity, there are varying versions of this, but there are things consistent throughout. Appearing mysteriously on Zerox, the Sorcerers planet, he joined their ranks and rose in power quickly until, in a coup, seized absolute power over the planet, stealing the power of the other leading sorcerers for himself.  One who escaped his grasp there was an apprentice of his, Mysa Nal aka the White Witch.Armed with this mystical might, he embarked on a series of conquests of nearby worlds, and built a space empire using the technological might of the worlds he conquered combined with his sorcery (for example, just before a space battle every weapon in the enemy fleets would jam). This combination proved unstoppable, and he conquered over half the galaxy in short order, establishing a tyrannical grip. In these days he also came to be called the Dark Lord. The worlds which remained outside his grasp lived in fear.  Then at some point, it seemed his power, which had scaled upwards astronomically, wavered. As Shooter put it, he no longer conquered worlds wholesale, but instead picked and chose carefully, as if selecting baubles from a jewelers tray. (Adventure Comics #369)One of the key worlds outside his grasp was Earth. The of Super-Heroes defended it, and when he set his sights on it, a conflict was inevitable.  In a titanic struggle, the Legion defeated Mordrus space armada, but then he himself entered combat personally, appearing as a 100 giant (Mordru commonly used magic to increase his size). He defeated most of the Legion, but was sealed in an airless vault at superspeed by Superboy and Mon-El, triggering his old phobia and rendering him comatose. The vault was placed beneath Legion Headquarters.Lass, exploring the headquarters, stumbled upon his vault and opened it to see what was inside.  Mon-El tried to seal the vault (and in the process of warning her told the backstory related in the preceding paragraphs). Yet as air had entered the vault, Mordru roused, and proved unstoppable. The Legion fled via a Time Bubble. This early event foreshadowed problems Mordru would have with time and those who manipulated it.  Because they didnt have time to adjust the time bubble, it went to its last setting, Smallville in Superboys time. They figured Mordru would think to look for them there, so they hid the Time Bubble, and adopted secret identities in Smallville, assisted by Superboy as Kent.  Mordru used his magic to track them down, possessing various townspeople including Lang to act as his spies and agents. When she found the Legion, she reported them, and he arrived. They fought again, but the Legion finally triumphed in battle. As always, the end result left him trapped, comatose, but not dead.This established the classic Mordru story cycle.  Every once in a while, something would again free Mordru, he would begin his machinations against the Legion, with whom he became increasingly obsessed, and they would again defeat him, leaving him trapped until a writer sought to revive him again.EarthwarLord RomdurAfter his previous appearance, he fled to a backwater planet named Avalon and took the name Romdur (an anagram of Mordru).  Star Boy used his mass-inducing power to collapse his castle, trapping him again.Great Darkness SagaRelations with other VillainsMordru was such a dominant figure in the 30th century that other would-be conquerors had to account for him in their plans, sometimes involving the Legion in their attempts to get at Mordru.  Stargrave masqueraded as 5s father and sent him on a series of missions to gather artifacts aimed at defeating Mordru.  He even enlisted the aid of the Trapper, ordering him to kill the Legion to prove his worthiness as a capable assistant in a coming battle against Mordru.  When the Legion prevailed, he attempted to use them for the same purpose.  Later, an alien sorcerer named SDen tried to trick the Legion into retrieving yet another artifact, again with the goal of toppling Mordru.V4 (aka Five Years later) Legion versionIn the V4 Legion, it was revealed that originally Mordru was fated to rule the universe for a thousand years. Seeing this timeline, the Trapper manipulated the Legion into existence in order to block Mordrus rise to ultimate power. However, when the Legion defeated Darkseid in the Great Darkness Saga, the Time Trapper realized they had become more powerful than he expected and were a potential threat to him. After Valor destroyed the Time Trapper, Mordru did indeed come to power before the previously minor villain Glorith cast a spell, at the expense of her own life, that caused her essence to retroactively take on the role previously held by the Time Trapper as a time manipulator who would (indirectly) create the legion to block Mordru. In this new timeline, Glorith was orchestrating a battle between the Legion and Mordru in which they would be evenly matched, destroy each other, and let her pick up the pieces as the only remaining power in the universe. Boy however figured out her plan, and turned the tables on her, visiting Mordru in disguise and provoking him into attacking Glorith before she was ready (but still more powerful than he expected).  The result was a stalemate which cost both Mordru and Glorith the bulk of their power.  In this retcon, this explains the sudden drop in Mordrus meteoric rise to power referenced above.  He was still powerful, but had to content himself with ruling what he had conquered thus far.This left the timeline roughly intact, with Mordrus advance across the galaxy held in check. Defeated after one of his schemes, the Sorcerers on Zerox removed his magical might and were able to cure his mind, and he lived a happy life first on Zerox, then on Tharn after Zerox was destroyed in the Magic Wars.  He even married his old apprentice and later enemy (and Legionnaire) Mysa Nal, the White Witch.  In the economic collapse of the Galaxy which played a central role of the post-Magic Wars Legion, the planet Tharn was undefended and facing devastation at the hands of the Khund.  As none of their other sorcerers had ever proved effective at fighting things such as starships, the Sorcerers council decided to restore Mordrus power to him, despite knowing its corrupting influence on him.  In short order he defeated the Khundish threat and set  himself up as Emperor.  His power was still nowhere near his glory days, though easily enough to defeat the Lantern Vidar who showed up on Tharn.  The Legion turned up looking for him; he seemed capable of taking them all on but backed off when Boy pointed out that he couldnt afford to take them on and the Planets, which would happen if there was an incident.  He relented, releasing them and Vidar.Mordru eventually allied with Glorith in an attempt to further manipulate history again.  These attempts weakened time and played a role in the Zero Hour crossover event, which completely erased previous Legion continuity.Post-Zero Hour (30th and 31st centuries)In the continuity established after Zero Hour, Mordru established an empire covering a vast swathe of space (though very little of it was based in what would become United Planets space) in the 28th and 29th centuries before finally being defeated and imprisoned in an airtight vault on the asteroid Yuen by Mysa - now his daughter - after he had killed all her allies and severely aged her.He was released (out of frame) by a mining project, a little before the new Legionnaires Sensor, Umbra, and Magno were called to investigate a series of accidents on the asteroid, actually caused by a Legion of Super-Rejects, and then spent time retrieving his talismans, absorbing the power of some of his other descendents, and searching for the Emerald Eye of Ekron - his favourite and most powerful talisman which was possessing Shrinking Violet at the time. When he first encountered the Legion, he defeated them easily and sent them away to serve as his heralds, destroying the planet Sklar in the process as a demonstration of his power.(When he found the Eye, it resisted, until he was finally defeated by a Legion-led alliance including Mysa (who he deaged and depowered during the fight), the Workforce, and the Amazers and sealed in an airtight sphere. While the Elements of Disaster threatened to revive him at one point, he did not appear again.Legion of 3 WorldsMordru was among the villains in Superboy-Primes of Super-Villains. He apparently is the ruler of the Sorcerers World and looks similar to his original incarnation. He holds the White Witch hostage on his world after she came to him years before to be his protege. In this storyline, Mordru claims that he is in command of all the left over magic in the universe and killed fellow mystics Glorith, Dragonmage, and Evillo.(Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #1) After Kinetix is killed by Superboy-Prime, Mordru absorbs her magical abilities and those of the other sorcerers of Universe-247. However, Mordru himself is subsequently absorbed by the White Witch, who is transformed into the Black Witch by Mordrus evil nature.(Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #4-5)Powers and abilitiesMordrus sorcerous powers are amongst the most formidable in the DC universe. He is capable of flight, control over matter at a molecular level, generation of magical energy in the form of bolts or shields, and the formation of solid objects. He can magically heal fatal wounds sustained by himself or those of others, and even regrow limbs out of chthonic energy. When Scott slashed Mordrus abdomen open with an energy sword, the sorcerer was able to heal the injury in seconds before ripping the Starheart from Alans body. During his attack on the Justice Society in New York, he was able to take multiple blows from Girl without serious damage, and was able to withstand a joint attack by the JSA and the Freedom Fighters. He has also demonstrated superhuman strength sufficient to lift objects weighing several tons with relative ease. Already vast on their own, Mordrus powers become almost invincible by tapping the power of vast repositories of magical energy such as the Rock of Eternity, Fates artifacts, the Starheart, and Arions body.Mordru is also apparently ageless. In JSA: Justice Be Done, the Hourman android attempted to de-age Mordru to a point where he was not as powerful. In the process, however, he discovered that Mordrus timeline had no beginning or end. Mordru had apparently never been born, and would never die.In the 30th and 31st centuries, Mordru is the premier sorcerer in the known universe, and arguably the Legion of Super-Heroes most powerful individual foe.  Only Darkseid and the Trapper (or Glorith) rival him in terms of raw power.In other mediaLegends of the SuperheroesDell portrayed Mordru in 1979s live action miniseries of the Superheroes, in which he sings an evil version of the song Thats Entertainment!.Justice League UnlimitedMordru made an appearance in League Unlimiteds first season episode, The Greatest Story Never Told. He was portrayed in his Silver Age incarnation, but as the episode focused on the side adventure of fame-seeking hero Gold, Mordrus backstory was not explored. However, his god-like power was noted as it took the entire Justice League (with the exceptions of Jonn, Shayera, Flash, and of course Booster Gold) to confront him with Man delivering the blow that knocked him unconscious.Legion of Super HeroesA wizard resembling Mordru makes an appearance in the first season Legion of Super-Heroes episode Childs Play as a member of the Sorcerers World Council on Zarok. Openly disdainful of the United Planets, he supports starting an all out war with Earth because of a minor breach in etiquette. He was voiced by McGonagle. The actual Mordru appears as the villain of the second season episode Trials (this time voiced by James Ward) where he attempts to drain the magic of the wizards on the Council so he can rule the planet Zarok. He was defeated by Zyx and the Legion.Referencesit:Mordrupt:Mordru

Frontierland
:For the closed theme park in Morecambe, England, see Morecambe.Frontierland is one of the themed lands at the many Disneyland-style parks run by Disney around the world.  Themed to the Old West of the 19th century, Frontierlands are home to cowboys and pioneers, saloons, red rock buttes and rushes.  Every instance of Frontierland has a Thunder Mountain Railroad, and a stretch of riverfront.  Other attractions sometimes found in this land include Mountain, the Bear Jamboree, Tom Sawyer Island, and a steam-powered riverboat.DisneylandaccessibleFrontierland first appeared in Disneyland as one of five original themed lands.  Conceived by Disney, the land did not initially contain many attractions, but centered on open expanses of wilderness which could be traversed by guests via stagecoach, pack mules and walking trails.  The Mine Train Thru Natures Wonderland opened in 1960, consisting of a sedate train ride around various western landscape dioramas.  The Mine Train closed in 1977 to make way for a new attraction; the Thunder Mountain Railroad, which opened in 1979.Disneylands Frontierland gateway is constructed of ponderosa pine logs. The lands long shoreline along the Rivers of America is considered a prime viewing location for the nighttime Fantasmic! show.  The docks to both the Twain Riverboat and the Ship Columbia, (a replica of American explorer Robert Grays 18th century ship that circumnavigated the globe) are located here, and Tom Sawyer Island in the rivers center is also considered a property of FrontierlandFrontierlands buildings have lots of detail too. On the roof of the Westward Ho Trading Co., there are elk or deer antlers. Elk antlers were commonly placed on general stores in the old west so cowboys coming into town immediately knew where to get supplies. Also in Frontierland is a building that has a large sign that says Laod Bhang Co. Fireworks Factory. Plus, at the storefront marked Crockett and Russel Hat Co., youll find a window honoring Parker, who played Crockett in Disneys Davy Crockett. Frontierland borders Fantasyland (via the Big Thunder Trail), Orleans Square and Adventureland, and connects to the Central Plaza through an iconic set of fort-style gates.Attractions* Thunder Mountain Railroad* Shooting Exposition* Thunder Ranch* The Golden Horseshoe Stage* Lair*Twain RiverboatDining*The Golden Horseshoe Cafe*Stage Door Cafe*Rancho del Zocalo Restaurante*River Belle Terrace*Big Thunder Ranch BarbecueShopping*The Spirit of Pocahontas Shop*Bonanza Outfitters*Westward Ho Trading Company*Pioneer Mercantile*Silver SpurFormer Attractions* Fink 169 Boats (1955-1997)* Woodys Roundup* Little Patch of Heaven Petting Farm* Burning Settlers Cabin* Casa de Fritos* Ceremonial Dance Circle* Conestoga Wagons* Dixieland Band Stand* Fort Wilderness* Indian Village* McDonalds in Disneyland* Natures Wonderland* Rainbow Caverns Mine Traine* Rainbow Ridge Pack Mules* Silver Banjo Barbecue* Stagecoach RideThe Magic Kingdomaccessiblethumb|Magic Kingdoms Big Thunder MountainDisney World opened its Magic Kingdom in 1971, complete with Frontierland.

Tom Sawyer Island opened two years later in 1973.  The northwestern end of the park was supposed to receive a massive, pavilion-style E ticket attraction, which was never built.  (See also River Expedition)  The area sat empty until Thunder Mountain Railroad made its debut in 1980.Little change would be made to the land for the next eleven years. In 1991, construction began on Mountain, and the western end of the land with the exception of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was demolished and rebuilt from scratch, including the existing Walt Disney World Railroad station and parade access road.

In many countries, and throughout history, thousands of villages were deserted for a variety of causes. Abandonment of villages is often related to plague, famine, war, change, environmental destruction, or deliberate clearances.United KingdomIn the Kingdom, several phases of village abandonment have occurred, resulting in what have become known as medieval villages.Climate changeIn the early centuries of the Ages, the population of Britain increased rapidly. This meant that farmland was in short supply, and so many villages were established upon less fertile lands. However, from around 1200 onwards, the climate became harsher, as what is sometimes called the Ice Age began. Villages situated on exposed uplands or upon clay vales where the soil became waterlogged bore the brunt of the changes. Eventually, crop failures forced many such villages to be abandoned.Black DeathIn 1348, the Death arrived; between 3050% of the British population was killed in the years that followed. Many village abandonments have been attributed to the Black Death, although relatively few are known to have been directly caused by it. Many depopulated villages were soon re-settled and re-populated, especially those with productive lands. The indirect effects of the Black Death, however, proved fatal to many villages, especially those inhabited by serfs who found themselves emancipated after the system collapsed.EnclosuresThroughout most of the Middle Ages, labour was plentiful and cheap, but after the Black Death, labour became in short supply. This improved the bargaining position of labourers, who demanded better pay and conditions from landowners.In response, many landowners discovered that the rearing of sheep for wool, was far more profitable than rent from tenants. land was then enclosed  a flock of sheep only needed a handful of shepherds to look after them, and villagers who were no longer required were evicted from the lands. The process of enclosures flourished throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, and led to many thousands of villages being deserted. This led to poverty and homelessness amongst rural dwellers, and gave rise to mass revolts in 1536, 1569, and 1607. Most notoriously, the Clearances in northern Scotland led to significant depopulation.Other reasonsMany villages were deliberately cleared throughout history. The of the North caused widespread devastation in the winter of 10691070. In the 12th and 13th centuries, many villages were removed to make way for monasteries. Later on, in the 18th century, it became fashionable for land-owning aristocrats to live in large mansions set in large landscaped parklands. Villages that obstructed the view were removed. By the early 19th century, it had become common to provide replacement villages, though in many cases, communities were turned out into the road. In modern times, a few villages have been abandoned due to reservoirs being built and the location being flooded. These include Mardale Green in the English Lake District and two villages  Ashopton and Derwent  drowned by the Reservoir in Derbyshire. In other cases, such as Mills, East Sussex, Imber and Tyneham, the village lands have been converted to military training areas. Villages in Northumberland have been demolished to make way for open cast mines. Hampton-on-Sea was abandoned due to coastal erosion thought to have been exacerbated by the building of a pier.() Other regions Armenia and AzerbaijanHundreds of villages in western Azerbaijan went deserted as, between 1988 and 1993, 800,000 ethnic Azeris and Kurds fled the Armenian-occupied Nagorno-Karabakh province of Azerbaijan and the surrounding regions. Similarly, nearly 200 villages in Armenia itself once populated by Azeris and Kurds were abandoned by 1991 as a result of the conflict.AustraliaIn Australia, the government requires operators of mining towns to remove all traces of the town when it is abandoned.  This has occurred in the case of Mary Kathleen, Goldsworthy and Shay Gap. Some towns have been lost or moved when dams are built.CyprusVillages have been abandoned as a result of the dispute. Some of these are reported to be landmined.(Cyprus, Landmine Monitor Report 1999)GermanyFile:Leisenberger-Kirche.jpg.jpg|thumb|Church ruin in the Wstung Leisenberg, near GillersheimThere are hundreds of abandoned villages, known as Wstungen, in Germany. Geographer Kurt Scharlau categorized the different types in the 1930s, making distinctions between temporary and permanent Wstung, settlements used for different purposes (farms or villages), and the extent of abandonment (partial or total).(K. Scharlau, Beitrge zur geographischen Betrachtung der Wstungen, Badische Geographische Abteilungen Vol. 10, Freiburg i. Br. 1933.) His scheme has been expanded, and has been criticized for not taking into account expansion and regression. A distinction is commonly made between Flurwstungen (farmed areas) and Ortswstungen (sites where buildings formerly stood) by archaeologists. The most drastic period of abandonment in modern times was during the 14th and 15th centuries  before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this had been reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450.() As in Britain, the Black Death played a large role in this, as did the growth of large villages and towns, the Little Ice Age, the introduction of rotation, and war (in Germany, particularly the Years War). In later times, the Empire created a number of training grounds for the military that were eventually abandoned.Hong KongMany villages in remote parts of the Territories, Kong, usually in valleys or on islands, have been abandoned due to inaccessibility. Residents go to live in urban areas with better job opportunities. Some villages have been moved to new sites to make way for reservoirs or town development. See also villages of Hong Kong and of villages in Hong Kong.HungaryHundreds of villages were abandoned during the Ottoman wars in the of Hungary in the 1617th century. Many of them were never repopulated and generally left few visible traces. Real ghost towns are rare in present-day Hungary, except the abandoned villages of Derenk (left in 1943) and Nagygc (left in 1970). Due to the decrease of rural population beginning in the 1980s dozens of villages are now threatened with abandonment. The first village officially declared as died out was Gyrf in the end of the 1970s but later it was repopulated as an eco-village. Sometimes depopulated villages were successfully saved as small rural resorts like Kn, Tornakpolna, Szanticska, Gorica and Rvfalu.India (Bengal famine)About ten million people, approximately one-third of the population of the affected area, are estimated to have died in the famine. Regions where the famine occurred included especially the modern Indian states of Bihar and Bengal, but the famine also extended into Orissa and Jharkhand as well as modern Bangladesh. Among the worst affected areas were Birbhum and Murshidabad in Bengal, and Tirhut, Champaran and Bettiah in Bihar.A partial shortfall in crops, considered nothing out of the ordinary, occurred in 1768 and was followed in late 1769 by more severe conditions. By September 1769 there was a severe drought, and alarming reports were coming in of rural distress. These were, however, ignored by company officers.By early 1770 there was starvation, and by mid-1770 deaths from starvation were occurring on a large scale. There were also reports of the living feeding on the bodies of the dead in the middle of that year. Smallpox and other diseases further took their toll of the population. Later in 1770 good rainfall resulted in a good harvest and the famine abated. However, other shortfalls occurred in the following years, raising the total death toll.As a result of the famine, large areas were depopulated and returned to jungle for decades to come as the survivors migrated en masse in a search for food. Many cultivated lands were abandoned  much of Birbhum, for instance, returned to jungle and was virtually impassable for decades afterwards. From 1772 on, bands of bandits and thugs became an established feature of Bengal, and were only brought under control by punitive actions in the 1780s.Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza StripAs a consequence of the Arab-Israeli War of 1948-9, about half million Arabs were displaced, leaving an estimated three hundred Arab villages and towns in Israel abandoned. In addition, several Jewish communities in what became the Bank and Strip were also abandoned. In August 2005, Israel evacuated Katif and all other Jewish communities in the Gaza Strip. Some structures in these settlements, including greenhouses and synagogues, were left standing after the withdrawal.North AfricaOases and villages in North Africa have been abandoned due to the expansion of the Sahara desert.RomaniaMany Saxon villages in Transylvania became de-populated or abandoned when their German-speaking inhabitants emigrated to Germany in the 1990s.See also*medieval village*town*recycling*demography*field (ecology)References(External links*Abandoned villages of Britainaf:Wstungde:Wstungnl:Wstung

Shot_peening
thumb|Hearst Mining building (stone, left) with expansion (shot peened aluminum alloy, right).Shot peening is a cold working process used to produce a compressive stress layer and modify mechanical properties of metals. It entails impacting a surface with shot (round metallic, glass, or ceramic particles) with force sufficient to create plastic deformation.(Shot Peening, Tool and Manufacturing Engineers Handbook (TMEH), Volume 3, Society of Manufacturing Engineers, 1985) It is similar to sandblasting, except that it operates by the mechanism of plasticity rather than abrasion: each particle functions as a hammer. In practice, this means that less material is removed by the process, and less dust created. Details Peening a surface spreads it plastically, causing changes in the mechanical properties of the surface. Shot peening is often called for in aircraft repairs to relieve tensile stresses built up in the grinding process and replace them with beneficial compressive stresses. Depending on the part geometry, part material, shot material, shot quality, shot intensity, shot coverage, shot peening can increase fatigue life from 01000%.deformation induces a residual compressive stress in a peened surface, along with tensile stress in the interior. Surface compressive stresses confer resistance to metal fatigue and to some forms of stress corrosion.( The tensile stresses deep in the part are not as problematic as tensile stresses on the surface because cracks are less likely to start in the interior.A study done through the SAE Fatigue Design and Evaluation Committee showed what shot peening can do for welds compared to welds that didnt have this operation done. The study claimed that the regular welds would fail after 250,000 cycles when welds that had been shot peened would fail after 2.5 million cycles, and outside the weld area. This is part of the reason that shot peening is a popular operation with aerospace parts. However, the beneficial prestresses can anneal out at higher temperatures.  Intensity is a key parameter of the shot peening process. After some development of the process, an analog was needed to measure the effects of shot peening. John Almen noticed that shot peening made the side of the sheet metal that was exposed begin to bend and stretch. He created the strip to measure the compressive stresses in the strip created by the shot peening operation. One can obtain what is referred to as the intensity of the blast stream by measuring the deformation on the Almen strip that is in the shot peening operation.( As the strip reaches a 10% deformation, the Almen strip is then hit with the same intensity for twice the amount of time. If the strip deforms another 10%, then one obtains the intensity of the blast stream.Coverage, the percentage of the surface indented once or more, is subject to variation due to the angle of the shot blast stream relative to the workpiece surface. The stream is cone-shaped, thus, shot arrives at varying angles. Processing the surface with a series of overlapping passes improves coverage, although variation in stripes will still be present. Alignment of the axis of the shot stream with the axis of the Almen strip is important. A continuous compressively stressed surface of the workpiece has been shown to be produced at less than 50% coverage but falls as 100% is approached. Optimizing coverage level for the process being performed is important for producing the desired surface effect.(Kirk, David, Non-Uniformity of Shot Peening Coverage, The Shot Peener, Electronics, Inc., Summer 2009)Internationals(Standards Development Program) includes several standards for shot peening in aerospace and other industries.Process and equipmentPopular methods for propelling shot media include air blast systems and centrifugal blast wheels.  In the air blast systems, media is introduced by various methods into the path of high pressure air and accelerated through a nozzle directed at the part to be peened. The centrifugal blast wheel consists of a high speed paddle wheel. Shot media is introduced in the center of the spinning wheel and propelled by the centrifugal force by the spinning paddles towards the part by adjusting the media entrance location, effectively timing the release of the media. Other methods include ultrasonic peening, wet peening, and laser peening (which does not use media).Media choices include spherical cast steel shot, ceramic bead, glass bead or conditioned (rounded) cut wire.(MIL-S-13165C)  Cut wire shot is preferred because it maintains its roundness as it is degraded, unlike cast shot which tends to break up into sharp pieces that can damage the workpiece. Cut wire shot can last five times longer than cast shot. Because peening demands well-graded shot of consistent hardness, diameter, and shape, a mechanism for removing shot fragments throughout the process is desirable. Equipment is available that includes separators to clean and recondition shot and feeders to add new shot automatically to replace the damaged material.(A popular method for sorting damaged/out-of-spec shot media is the use of shot separators.  Production sized separators consist of various levels of precision wire mesh, from 1 or more sizes to sort, and is mechanically shaken.  Some applications require a maximum and minimum level of shot diameter.  To maintain specifications, shot is slowly introduced where the large shot/contamination will be sorted in the first stage, then shot within specifications are sorted in the second level, then degraded shot below specifications is sorted last. The openings on the wire mesh progressively get smaller in this instance. It is possible to attach a production separator to a shot peener for continuous control of shot quality. Testing methods use a similar concept in a much smaller package, where a technician takes a sample of shot and then sorts the various sizes.  Further testing of the samples verifies the quality of the shot media. Wheel blast systems include satellite rotation models, rotary throughfeed components, and various manipulator designs. There are overhead monorail systems as well as reverse-belted models. Workpiece holding equipment includes rotating index tables, loading and unloading robots, and jigs that hold multiple workpieces. For larger workpieces, manipulators to reposition them to expose features to the shot blast stream are available.(CoverageFactors effecting coverage density include: number of impacts (shot flow), exposure time, shot properties (size, chemistry), and work piece properties. Coverage is monitored by visual examination to determine the percent coverage (0-100%).  Coverage beyond 100% cant be determined. The number of individual impacts is linearly proportional to shot flow, exposure area, and exposure time.  Coverage is not linearly proportional because of the random nature of the process.  When 100% coverage is achieved, with an exposure time of 1T, locations on the surface have been impacted multiple times.  At 1.5T, 5 or more impacts occur at half of locations. At 2T, 5 or more impacts occur at just over 3/4 of locations.Coverage is effected by shot geometry and the shot and workpiece chemistry.  The size of the shot controls how many impacts there are per pound, where smaller shot produces more impacts per pound therefore requiring less exposure time.  Soft shot impacting hard material will take more exposure time to reach acceptable coverage compared to hard shot impacting a soft material.Coverage and intensity (measured by Almen strips) can have a profound effect on fatigue life.  This can effect a variety of materials typically shot peened. Incomplete or excessive coverage and intensity can result in reduced fatigue life. Overpeening will cause excessive cold working of the surface of the workpiece, which can also cause fatigue cracks.(.ApplicationsShot peening is used on gear parts, cams and camshafts, clutch springs, springs, rods, crankshafts, gearwheels, leaf and suspension springs, rock drills, and turbine blades. It is also used in foundries for sand removal, decoring, descaling, and surface finishing of castings such as engine blocks and heads. Its descaling action can be used in the manufacturing of steel products such as strip, plates, sheets, wire, and bar stock.(DISA Makes an Impact on The Science and Technology of Shot-Peening, Metal Finishing News, March 2006.)(Shot peening is a crucial process in spring making. Types of springs include leaf springs, extension springs, and compression springs. The most widely used application are for engine valve springs (compression springs) due to high cyclic fatigue. In an OEM valve spring application, the mechanical design combined with some shot peening ensures longevity; however, automotive makers are shifting to more high performance higher stressed valve spring designs as modern engines evolve. In aftermarket high performance valve spring applications, the need for controlled and multi-step shot peening is a requirement to withstand extreme surface stresses that sometimes exceeds material specifications! The fatigue life of an extreme performance spring (NHRA, IHRA) can be as short as two passes down a 1/4 mile drag racing track before relaxation or failure occurs.Shot peening may be used for cosmetic effect. The surface roughness resulting from the overlapping dimples causes light to scatter upon reflection. Because peening typically produces larger surface features than sand-blasting, the resulting effect is more pronounced.Shot peening and blasting can apply materials on metal surfaces. When the shot or grit particles are blasted through a powder or liquid containing the desired surface coating, the impact plates or coats the workpiece surface. The process has been used to embed ceramic coatings, though the coverage is random rather than coherent. 3M developed a process where a metal surface was blasted with particles with a core of alumina and an outer layer of silica. The result was fusion of the silica to the surface. The process known as peen plating was developed by NASA. Fine powders of metals or non-metals are plated onto metal surfaces using glass bead shot as the blast medium. The process has evolved to applying solid lubricants such as molybdenum disulphide to surfaces. Biocompatible ceramics have been applied this way to biomedical implants. Peen plating subjects the coating material to high heat in the collisions with the shot and also must be available in powder form, limiting the range of materials that can be used. To overcome the problem of heat, a process called temperature moderated-collision mediated coating (TM-CMC) has allowed the use of polymers and antibiotic materials as peened coatings. The coating is presented as an aerosol directed to the surface at the same time as a stream of shot particles. The TM-CMC process is still in the R&D phase of development.(Haverty, Donncha and Brendan Kennedy, Shot Peening: A Powerful Surface Coating Tool for Biomedical Implants, The Shot Peener, Electronics, Inc., Summer 2009.)Compressive residual stress (metal alloy)A sub-surface compressive residual stress profile is measured using techniques such as x-ray diffraction and hardness profile testing. The X-axis is depth in mm or inches and the Y-axis is residual stress in ksi or MPa. The maximum residual stress profile can be affected by the factors of shot peening, including: part geometry, part material, shot material, shot quality, shot intensity, and shot coverage. For example, shot peening a hardened steel part with a process and then using the same process for another unhardened part could result in overpeening; causing a sharp decrease in surface residual stresses, but not affecting sub-surface stresses.  This is critical because max stresses are typically at the surface of the material. Mitigation of these lower surface stresses can be accomplished a multi-stage post process with varied shot diameters and other surface treatments that remove the low residual stress layer.The compressive residual stress in a metal alloy is produced by the transfer of energy (K.E.) from a moving mass (shot particle or ball peen) into the surface of a material with the capacity to plastically deform. The residual stress profile is also dependent on coverage density. The mechanics of the collisions involve properties of the shot hardness, shape, and structure; as well as the properties of the workpiece. Factors for process development and the control for K.E. transfer for shot peening are: shot velocity (wheel speed or air pressure/nozzle design), shot mass, shot chemistry, impact angle and work piece properties. Example: if you needed very high residual stresses you would likely want to use large diameter cut-wire shot, high-intensity process, direct blast onto the workpiece, and a very hard workpiece material.HistoryIt was common practice for blacksmiths to hammer peen the concave side of leaf springs, which enhanced their life, although the exact mechanism was unknown.  The maximum tensile stresses are located on the surface of the concave portion of leaf springs; the peening effectively offset the maximum tensile stresses, also located on the surface, when the compressive stresses were induced by peening with a ball peen hammer.Shot peening was independently invented in Germany and the United States in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The first commercial implementation was done in the United States on automotive valve springs.See also*Autofrettage, which produces compressive residual stresses in pressure vessels.*hardening*hardening*abrasivesReferencesExternal links*Portal of shot peening, The Shot Peener magazine*Blast machine operation in 10 steps*Descriptions of various shot peening media*Explanation and video on shot peening process*Information on shot peening and comparison to other methods of surface enhancement*Shot Peening Applications Guidebook* Momber, A.W.: Blast Cleaning Technology.

Fly_River
The Fly at , is the second longest river, after the Sepik, in New Guinea. The Fly is the largest river in Oceania, the largest in the world without a single dam in its catchment, and overall ranks as the twenty-fifth largest river in the world by volume of discharge(Fragmentation and Flow Regulation of the Worlds Major River Systems). It rises in the Emanuel Range arm of the Mountains, and crosses the south-western lowlands before flowing into the of Papua in a large delta.DescriptionThe Fly flows mostly through the Western Province, though for a small stretch it forms the boundary between PNG and the Indonesia province of Papua.  This section protrudes slightly to the west of the 141E longitude line.  To compensate for this slight gain in territory for PNG, the border south of the Fly River is slightly east of the 141E longitude line.  As part of this deal, Indonesia has the right to use the Fly River to its mouth for navigation.The principal tributaries of the Fly are the Strickland and the Ok Tedi. Delta thumb|left|The original survey map created by L.M. DAlbertis in 1876The estuary of the Fly River is 56 km wide at its entrance, but only 11 km wide abreast Island, which may be considered as being the river mouth. Above this island the river gradually contracts to a width of 1.6 kilometers or less.The river delta is studded with low and swampy islands covered with mangrove and nipa palm. There are villages and cultivated areas on these islands. The land on both sides of the estuary is of the same character. The islands in the estuary are flat and are covered with athick, fertile alluvial soil. The largest islands are Island, Island, Island, Island, Island, and Island. Kiwai, Wabuda and Domori are inhabited.A list of the river delta islands is:400px|thumb|right|Map of Fly River DeltaThe inhabitants of the Fly River delta engage in agriculture and hunting. Coconut palm, breadfruit, plantain, sago palm, and sugar cane are grown. History The Fly was first discovered by Europeans in 1842 when Blackwood commanding the corvette HMS Fly, surveryed the western coast of the Gulf of Papua.() The river was named after his ship and he proclaimed that it would be possible for a small steam powered boat to travel up the mighty river.()In 1876 Italian explorer, DAlbertis, was the first person to successfully attempt this when he travelled 900 km into the interior of New Guinea, in his steamer, Neva.  It was the furthest any European explorer had ever been into the island.(Environmental issuesBoth the Strickland and the Ok Tedi river have been the source of environmental controversy due to tailings waste from the Mine and the Tedi Mine respectively. In 2008, Dr Ian Campbell, a former advisor to Tedi Mining Limited, claimed that company data suggests significant portions of the Fly River floodplain are at a high risk from mine drainage.() References br:Fly(eka)Flyde:FlyFly(fleuve)(fiume)(mto)lt:Flajusja:(elv)pl:Fly()sr:(joki)

Frank_Plicka
Frank Plicka (born 11 June 1926 - died 9th December 2010 in Sydney, Australia()) is a Czech-born Australian photographer, best known for his book Streets of Sydney, an extraordinary tour of Sydney, documented in black & white photographs taken over the last 30 years. This book depicts life in, and around Sydney streets, pubs, bars, galleries, and beaches.(http://www.photoaccess.com.au/?qtaxonomy/term/8)BiographyPlicka was born in 1926 in a mining town of Kladno, former Czechoslovakia. His father was a miner, often unemployed and as many others at that time, could not give the family a decent living.(http://blankproject-carajayne.blogspot.com/2009/08/frank-plicka-streets-of-sydney-huw.html)Starting a primary school meant a new happy life for Plicka. He finished school with best possible results, skipped high school and was enrolled in an elite school Real Gymnasium in 1937. After War II, during which Czech universities were closed, he continued his studies at University of Prague and graduated as a pedagog. Then until 1968, he was involved in sports professionally, coaching top Czech swimmers. In 1967, he was awarded a title Coach of the Year.In 1968, after Soviet invasion to Czechoslovakia, he fled to Australia. He settled in Sydney, taking different jobs at different places, and started concentrating on street photography.Besides Australia, he photographed one year in Africa (1970s) and three years in Asia (1980s). During last 35 years, he finished three books. At present time, only Streets of Sydney has been published.During recent years, Plicka held several exhibitions in Sydney, but prefers private life and does not seek a wider recognition.Workthumb|250px|Cover of Plickas first and only published book, Streets of SydneyFrom early age, Plicka was involved in sports and his desire to catch all moments led him to sports photography. As a sports photographer, he photographed in six European countries, including Russia.His trademark is candid black-and-white photography. He has been using different cameras during 65 years of work, but since 1952, he has been using Leica cameras, mainly his favourite M3. He uses 35 mm and 50 mm lenses for his work.Plicka has been processing his photos on his own from his beginnings.

Chteau-dx
Chteau-dx is a municipality in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland. It is in the district of Riviera-Pays-dEnhaut.HistoryChteau-dOex is first mentioned in 1115 as Oit, Oyz, Oix and Oyez.(Prehistoric settlementsDuring the late Paleolithic and Mesolithic (9500 to at least 6000 BC) caves around Chteau-dOex served as a seasonal settlement.  Age knives indicate that there was a settlement during that era as well.  Many of the local names (combe  valley, joeur  forest, man rock)and the local dialect are the only traces of a celtic settlement in the area.  The lack of iron ore and the sparseness of the soil probably prevented the romanization of lowland valleys.  During the Gallo-Roman era, the region may have been only sparsely populated.  By the 10th Century, the Alamannic settlements had only reached Le Vanel but then spread even higher and reached the pastures in LEtivaz in the southern part of the municipality.  The valley was known as the high Gau or Ogo.  The name may have come from the word for Ox or be a form of esch, (or ash).(Medieval historyIn the 10th Century, the Count of Gruyere conquered La Tine and the Creux de lEnfer.  Subsequently it was merged with Rossinire to form a district.  The church of St. Donat was consecrated and first mentioned in 1175.  The village church was under the authority of the Cluniac Priory of Rougemont, which was founded in 1080.  At the beginning of the 14th Century, the castle at La Motte was rebuilt for the Counts of Gruyere.  Another stronghold probably stood on the rocky spur which was known as Chteau Cottier.  After clearing the woods, the region was intensively farmed and produced barley, hay, hemp and cheese.  In 1388 the villagers threw off the obligation to serve the nobility.  Then, in 1403, against the wishes of the Count of Gruyres, the villagers joined a limited alliance with Bern.(Growth during the Early Modern eraIn 1555 Bern received the upper part of the county of Gruyere including Chteau-dOex.  It became part of the German-speaking bailiwick of Saanen.  The rights and freedoms of the villagers were now based on Bernese law and not on the Land Law of Moudon.  However, the village church was still part of the parish under the church of Lausanne.  Following the Reformation in 1555, the parish also included Etivaz until 1713.  Under Bernese rule, the economy experienced a strong upswing.  The common land was divided and sold before the end of the 16th Century.  The alpine pastures were leased to private cheese makers, who there produced cheese.  In the 18th Century, the inhabitants of the municipality sold the cheese, from the approximately 2,000 cows, at the market in Vevey.  From there it went over the Col de Jaman to Marseille where it was exported to Asia and America.(End of the Ancien Regime and Modern Chteau-dOexIn 1798, Chteau-dOex came to the newly formed of Lman.  In 1800, a fire destroyed the wooden houses on the central hill.  The houses had been built in this style and on the hill to avoid property taxes.  Thanks to the efforts of the Dean Philippe-Sirice Bridel enough money was raised to rebuild the houses in stone.  The municipality hired masons from Savoy, carpenters from Simmental and plasterers from the lower Gruyere lands lower uplands.  In 1803, the Canton of Lman was dissolved with the of Mediation and the municipality became part of the new canton of Vaud.(In 1849, the Institute Henchoz opened as a preparatory gymnasium, which replaced the older school.  The primary school received a new building in 1907.  Starting in 1847 a parish of the Free Church of the Canton of Vaud was established with two priests.  The Catholic parish was established in 1896 and the Anglican church parish was created in 1899.  Other religious communities, such as the Brethren, established churches in the valley.(  In the 19th Century, the municipality suffered several several outbreaks of livestock diseases.  To protect the dairy industry, non-local herds were forbidden from passing through the municipality.  has been so strange flocks of pulling prohibited.  Cheese was no longer allowed to be carried across the mountains but was now transported on local draft horses.  Due to customs taxes with the neighboring Canton of Fribourg, cheese was carried on a route over the Col de Chaude to Villeneuve (VD) and from there to the shores of Geneva, without crossing the Fribourg border.  The abolition of the inter-canton customs and taxes in 1848 led to the demolition of the Fribourg customs station on the main road that had linked Chteau-dOex with the grain and livestock markets.  Changes in markets and improvements in animal husbandry led to more cattle being raised for meat rather than cheese production.  The construction of the road over the Col des Mosses (186571) and the construction of a new road to Bull (1895) eased transportation.(The hospital, which had replaced the old hospital in 1926, was remodeled in 1979 into a nursing home and district hospital.  At the same time, solar heating was added to the building.  The municipal administration building was built in 1912, and renovated in 1958.  The Muse du Vieux Pays-dEnhaut was built in 1922.Until 1953 the Liberal party (PLS) and the Parti radical-dmocratique suisse {PRD) were separate parties that each published their own newspaper.  The PRD paper Le Progrs, however merged in 1940 into the (PLS), Journal de Chteau-dx, which became in 1989 the Journal du Pays dEnhaut.  The socialist and agrarian parties were not represented in the local parliament until 1957 when proportional representation was introduced.(  A power plant operated in La Chaudanne was from 1894 until about 1901.  The opening of the Bernois Railway (MOB) in 1904 made Chteau-dOex an attractive summer resort.  It was particularly appreciated by English tourists.  Between 1916-18 it also housed English internees during the war.  Half a dozen grand hotels with tennis courts sprang up in the municipality.  A tennis club was founded in 1894.  Other infrastructure included the suspension bridge at Turrian (1883), a swimming pool and a campsite (1932), a cable car (1945) and the Pont du Berceau (1945).  The agricultural sector has remained important, with the emphasis again shifting to cheese.  In the 20th Century, winter tourism became an important additional source of income.  Hot air balloons and river rafting became common in the summer.  While local crafts, sawmills and gravel mining are the main branches of the industrial sector.  Since 1945, the area around Pierreuse has been a protected heritage site.(GeographyChteau-dOex has an area, , of .  Of this area,  or 44.6% is used for agricultural purposes, while  or 35.9% is forested.   Of the rest of the land,  or 2.9% is settled (buildings or roads),  or 1.0% is either rivers or lakes and  or 15.6% is unproductive land.(Swiss Federal Statistical Office-Land Use Statistics 2009 data  accessed 25 March 2010)  Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 1.3% and transportation infrastructure made up 1.2%.  Out of the forested land, 30.0% of the total land area is heavily forested and 3.8% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees.  Of the agricultural land, 0.1% is used for growing crops and 10.5% is pastures and 34.0% is used for alpine pastures.  Of the water in the municipality, 0.4% is in lakes and 0.6% is in rivers and streams.  Of the unproductive areas, 9.3% is unproductive vegetation and 6.3% is too rocky for vegetation.(The municipality was part of the District until it was dissolved on 31 August 2006, and Chteau-dOex became part of the new district of Riviera-Pays-dEnhaut.(Nomenklaturen  Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz  accessed 4 April 2011)  The municipality is the largest in land area in the canton.  It is located in the upper Saane valley.  In the 14th to 18th Centuries, the seven tables of Sous le Scex, Mont, Village, Frasse, Entre deux Eaux, Monteiller and LEtivaz merged into the municipality.  It consists of the villages of Chteau-dOex, L Etivaz, Les Moulins and Les Granges, 35 hamlets and 22 alpine herding camps.Coat of armsThe blazon of the municipal of arms is Gules, a tower embattled Or, a wall embattled of the same in the dexter, surmounted by a crane Argent(Flags of the World.com accessed 09-August-2011)DemographicsChteau-dOex has a population (lcon) of .  , 19.1% of the population are resident foreign nationals.(Swiss Federal Statistical Office - Superweb database - Gemeinde Statistics 1981-2008  accessed 19 June 2010)  Over the last 10 years (19992009 ) the population has changed at a rate of 5%.

Kennecott_Utah_Copper
Kennecott Utah Copper Corporation (KUCC), a division of Tinto Group, is a mining, smelting, and refining company.  Its corporate headquarters are located in South Jordan, Utah, USA.  Kennecott operates one of the largest open-pit copper mines in the world in Bingham Canyon, Salt Lake County, Utah.  The company was first formed as 1898 as the Boston Consolidated Mining Company. The current corporation was formed in 1989.Historythumb|Bingham Canyon in 1942The Kennecott Utah Copper Company had its start when A. Wall realized the potential of copper deposits in Bingham Canyon,  southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah in 1887 and acquired claims to the land. Underground mining in the area was begun in 1890, and C. Jackling and C. Gemmell, both engineers, examined Walls properties and recommended mining. In 1898, Newhouse and Thomas Weir formed the Boston Consolidated Mining Company.Jackling and Wall formed the Utah Copper Company in 1903, and the company immediately started a pilot mill at Copperton. With financing from Guggenheim Exploration, the first digging began in 1906. The same year, the Kennecott Mines Company was formed in Alaska, named after explorer and naturalist Kennicott. A smelter was also started at Garfield by the Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) to refine the Bingham ore.In 1907, the Utah Copper mill in Magna started operation. Utah Copper and Boston Consolidated merged in 1910, and in 1915, Kennecott acquired 25% interest in the company. The and Garfield Railway opened in 1911 to transport the ore, replacing the and Rio Grande Railroads line. In 1936, Kennecott acquired all the assets of the Utah Copper Company.During War II, Bingham set new world records for copper mining and produced about 30% of the copper used by the Allies.  Many women worked in the mines, mills, and smelters.On September 9, 1949 three company officers were killed in an airplane bombing known as the Albert Guay Affair in Quebec: the retiring president E.T. Stannard; his designated successor, Arthur D. Storke; and R.J. Parker, a vice-president. Charles Cox, formerly head of Steel, was hired shortly after to fill the executive vacuum.By 1961, Kennecotts copper mines included four large open pits in the Arizona, Mexico, and Nevada, and one underground mine in Chile. As the mine in Utah expanded, it subsumed the land on which the town of Bingham was built, and the city ceased to exist in 1971.In 1981, a world-wide fall in copper prices brought about the acquisition of Kennecott by Oil of Ohio (SOHIO). Production was interrupted from 1985 to 1987. In the latter year, British Petroleum acquired SOHIO, and Kennecott became part of BP Minerals America. In 1989 Rio Tinto Zinc (RTZ) purchased mining assets from BP.  Kennecott Utah Copper Corporation was formed by Rio Tinto in 1989 as a new mining company under the laws of the State of Utah. Today, as the second largest copper producer in the United States, Kennecott Utah Copper provides about 18-25% percent of the U.S.s copper needs.  Kennecotts Bingham Canyon Mine is one of the largest man-made excavations in the world.  It is one of the top producing copper mines in the world with cumulative production at more than 18.7 million tons of copper. Every year, Kennecott produces approximately 300,000 tons of copper, along with 500,000 ounces of gold, 4 million ounces of silver, about 30 million pounds of molybdenum, and about 1 million tons of sulfuric acid, a by-product of the smelting process.   Since Rio Tinto purchased Kennecott Utah Copper in 1989 it has invested about $2 billion in the modernization of KUCs operations. KUCC has also spent more than $350 million on the cleanup of historic mining waste and $100 million on groundwater cleanup.  Rio Tinto employs 2,400 people and hundreds of contractors in UtahRio Tinto Group, one of the worlds largest mining operations, comprises companies Rio Tinto Limited (based in Melbourne) and Rio Tinto plc (based in London)  Although each company trades separately, the two Rio Tintos operate as one business.Environmental relationsFile:KennecottTailingsPond.png|thumb|right|Exterior of Kennecott waste pond near the Salt LakeSignificant groundwater contamination exists in the aquifer downgradient of the Bingham Canyon mining operations.  Approximately  are impacted in the southwest portion of Salt Lake County. Because of the remediation efforts, which include more than a $100 million dollar investment in a reverse osmosis facility, Kennecotts South End (location of the contaminated aquifer) was removed from the States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Priorities List (NPL). This investment represents one of many remediation projects along the Mountains to clean up historic mining sites. To date, Kennecott Utah Copper has remediated more than  of the total  impacted by mining at a cost of more than $450 million.  KUCC is considering possible alternatives that will keep the Bingham Canyon Mine open for another couple decades.  The open pit operations are projected to extend to 2019.Land developmentAnother Rio Tinto-owned company manages the non-mining land and water assets previously owned by KUCC, Kennecott Land Company, (KLC).  Kennecott Land was established by Rio Tinto in April 2001 to develop surplus mining land. Daybreak, the first part of the process, is situated on  in the city of South Jordan where 20,000 homes and up to  of commercial space are planned.  Opened in 2009, Daybreaks first commercial center, SoDa row, contains a boutique, restaurants, hair salon and more.See also*Harkers Canyon External links *Kennecott Website*More history of Kennecott Copper*Australian Science at Work entry for Rio Tinto LimitedCorporationUtah Copper

American_Fur_Company
The American Fur Company was founded by Jacob Astor in 1808.() The company grew to monopolize the trade in the States by 1830, and became one of the largest businesses in the country. The company was one the first great trusts in American business. It went out of business in 1842.HistoryCreationThe American Fur Company began on April 8, 1808 when Astor received a charter from York.() The original plan for the company was to establish a post at the mouth of the River, send an annual supply ship from York City to the post, then take fur from the post to China, where it would be traded for goods to be sold in New York.( Astor also hoped to trade with other posts along the coast of the Northwest, including Russian outposts of the Company.( From the beginning, Astor formed subsidiaries of the American Fur Company to manage the companys business in these areas.(SubsidiariesThe West Company handled the Midwestern fur trade, while the Fur Company dealt with operations in Country.  The early operations of the company were often in competition with the great Canadian and British fur trading companies: the Bay Company and the West Company.  During the of 1812 many of the American Fur Companys trading posts were lost to the British (those in the Northwest, including Astoria, were simply sold to the West Company). For a time it seemed that the company had been destroyed, but following the war, the United States passed a law excluding foreign traders from operating on U.S. territory.  This freed the American Fur Company from its competition with the Canadian and British companies.  It competed fiercely to establish a monopoly for the American Fur Company in the Great Lakes region and the Midwest.  In the 1820s the company expanded its monopoly into the Plains and the Mountains.  To achieve control of the industry, the company bought out or beat out many smaller competitors.  By 1830, the company had nearly complete control of the fur trade in the United States.The companys time at the top of Americas business world was short lived. Sensing the eventual decline of furs popularity in fashion, John Jacob Astor withdrew from the company in 1834. The company split up, and the Pacific Fur Company became independent. The Midwestern outfit would continue to be called the American Fur Company, and was now led by Crooks. To cut down on expenses, the company began closing many of its trading posts. DeclineThrough the 1830s, competition began to resurface. At the same time, the availability of furs in the Midwest declined. Bay Company, from its District headquarters at Vancouver began an effort to destroy the American fur companies during the late 1830s. By depleting furs in the River country and underselling the American Fur Company at the annual Mountain Rendezvous, the HBC effectively destroyed American fur trading efforts in the Rocky Mountains.() By the 1840s, silk was replacing fur for hats as the clothing fashion in Europe. The company was unable to cope with all these factors.  Despite efforts to increase profits by diversifying into other industries like lead mining, the American Fur Company folded.  The assets of the company were split into several smaller operations, most of which failed by the 1850s.ImpactDuring its heyday, the American Fur Company was one of the largest enterprises in the United States and held a total monopoly of the fur trade in the country. The company provided the money for the land investments that catapulted Jacob Astor to the position of richest man in the world and the first multi-millionaire in America. Astor remains the eighteenth wealthiest person of all time, and eighth to create that fortune in America, though he was actually from Germany. Part of Astors fortune went to found the Astor Library in New York City. Later it merged with the Library to form the York Public Library. On the frontier, the American Fur Company opened the way for the settlement and economic development of the Midwestern and Western United States.men working for the company carved the trails that led settlers into the West. Many cities in the Midwest and West, such as Oregon, grew up around American Fur Company posts. The American Fur Company played a major role in the development and expansion of the young United States.ReferencesFur CompanyFur CompanyFur CompanyFur CompanyFur Company Fur Company

Burleigh_Heads,_Queensland
 location1 Burleigh Heads is a suburb on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia. At the 2006 Census, Burleigh Heads had a population of 7,606.Burleigh Heads is renowned for its surf break, and is an alternative to the more tourist ridden towns of the Gold Coast. The centre of Burleigh Heads is James Street, a village consisting of cafes, delis, hairdressers, retailers, chemists, restaurants and charity stores. Burleigh Heads boundary extends as far north as Miami Headland, Miami, and as far south as Tallebudgera Creek, Palm Beach. To the west, is the township of West Burleigh, with its shopping mecca, and thriving industrial area, and Burleigh Waters, a quiet suburbia, beautified by a man made lake and many council parks and gardens. The headland of Burleigh, locally known as The Point, is a favourite for weekend barbecues, cricket, and if the surf is up, spectators appear. On a Sunday afternoon, the local musicians and fire-twirlers come out to the park beside Burleigh SLSC for a jam and dance session. HistoryThe northern section appears to have been subdivided by the mid 1950s, but was the site of extensive mining in the following decades. The broad beachfront park is a legacy of that activity.Burleigh township itself is much older and was the site of early development including restaurants and guest houses to support the increasing interest in bathing that took place in the last years of the 19th century and the first of the 20th century. It has been the centre of beach activities for many years.SchoolsThere are several schools servicing the Burleigh area including two state primary schools, there are however no state highschools in the area with students needing to travel to Miami or Palm Beach.The largest school in the area is Marymount College, a catholic day school educating both boys and girls from Prep to Year 12. The school has over 2000 students combined across the two campuses, Primary and Secondary, which are located on the corner of West Burleigh Rd and Bermuda St.Burleigh beachThe north-east facing beach is protected by the point to the south and offers one of the best swimming, body boarding and surfing beaches on the Gold Coast. A mature stand of Norfolk Island Pines &mdash; reputably some of the earliest planted at the coast &mdash; form an attractive backdrop and are home to native birds.SurfingThe Quicksilver Pro is often contested at Burleigh Heads when the surf is not contestable at Kirra or Snapper Rocks. The Breaka Burleigh Pro and many other amateur and junior events are also contested each year.Landmarks*The Fleay Wildlife Park  *Aboriginal Bora Ring*Head National Park Sport * Rugby league club - Bears * AFL club - Bombers * Cricket club - Bullsharks * Soccer club - BulldogsSee also*of Gold Coast suburbsReferencesExternal links* University of Queensland: Queensland Places: Burleigh Heads*Heritage Tour - Burleigh*Very GC - Burleigh Heads*Burleigh.com.au - About Burleigh Heads*Burleigh Holiday Ideas*Gold Coast City Council

It is known as the location of Lake and Lake and Rabat.The population of Naryn oblast is 99% Kyrgyz. The economy is dominated by animal herding (sheep, horses, yaks), with wool and meat as the main products.  Mining of various minerals developed during the Soviet era has largely been abandoned as uneconomical. Today the oblast is considered to be the poorest region in the country, but also the most typically Kirgyz.  It boasts beautiful mountains, alpine pastures and Lake which during summer months attracts large herds of sheep and horses with their herders and their yurts.Basic Socio-Economic Indicators* Population: 271,000 (assessment for 1 January 2009) including 17.4% - urban, and 82.6% - rural population(National Committee on Statistics (in Kyrgyz/Russian))* Employed population: 89,300 (2008) (National Committee on Statistics (in Kyrgyz/Russian))* Registered Unemployed Population: 6,922 (2008)(National Committee on Statistics (in Kyrgyz/Russian)) * Export: 0.9 million US dollars (2008)( National Committee on Statistics (in Kyrgyz/Russian) )* Import: 4.0 million US dollars (2008) (National Committee on Statistics (in Kyrgyz/Russian) )* Direct Foreign Investments: 1,1 million US dollars (in 2008)(National Committee on Statistics (in Kyrgyz/Russian))Districts of NarynNaryn Province is divided administratively into 5 districts (Kyrgyzstan - - )  thumb|Horses grazing near Son-KulReferencesLaurnnce Mitchell, Kyrgyzstan, Bradt Travel Guides, 2008Narynvilaytide NarinoblastNarynoblastde NarynNarinde NarynNaryndi NarynsritistartomnyNaryn, Kyrgyzstan(oblast)viloyatinaryski(provncia)Provincealue(provins)ilizh:

Himley_Hall
Himley Hall is a country house situated in Staffordshire, England. It is situated in the south of the county near the villages of Wombourne and Kingswinford, and the town of Sedgley (West Midlands). It is also several miles from the town of Dudley and the city of Wolverhampton.HistoryHimley Hall is a II* listed building.In early days, it was a moated manor house, standing beside the medieval church. For over four centuries it served as a secondary home to the Lords of Dudley and their knights. Its occupants included Dudley, whose seventeenth-century experiments in smelting iron ore with coal were carried out nearby. In 1645, King Charles I encamped in the grounds on his way to defeat at the of Naseby during the Civil War.In 1628, the Ward family inherited the title Lords of Dudley through the marriage of Humble Ward to the heiress to the Dudley estates, Frances Sutton. Humble Ward was the son of the jeweller and goldsmith to the court of King Charles I. Following damage to Castle during the Civil War, Himley Hall became the principal family home.Todays hall dates from the 18th century when John Ward demolished the medieval manor to make way for a great Palladian mansion. The village of Himley was relocated at this time, and its church rebuilt on its present site in 1764. In 1774 John Ward died and was succeeded by his son John junior. He brought in Lancelot Capability Brown to re-design the parkland. The 180 acres (728,000 m) of grounds were designed by Brown to include a great lake, fed by a series of waterfalls from a higher chain of smaller pools.  The family left Himley in the 1830s, because it was too close to the Country. They instead lived in great grandeur on their mineral wealth at Court at Witley in Worcestershire.  In 1934 the Duke and Duchess of Kent honeymooned at Himley. The Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) spent his last weekend there before his abdication.After the World War, the property was sold to the Coal Board for 45,000. During its conversion for this new purpose, a fire broke out in, and gutted, the South wing. This part of the house was rebuilt, but not according to its former appearance. The decline in the coal mining industry in the area led to the Hall being once more put on the market. In 1966, it was purchased jointly by Dudley and Wolverhampton County Borough Councils - despite existing within the South Staffordshire council area. The park was opened as a public leisure area. In 1988, Dudley bought Wolverhamptons share, gaining outright ownership.Himley ParkSet in the grounds of Himley Hall, Himley Park was created in the 1970s and is now visited by over 200,000 visitors each year. It features a large lake and hill with many woodland walks along with open parkland. There is a small log cabin cafe which is open for hot food and drinks for 364 days a year.There is also a nine hole public golf course which was designed by A & K Baker in 1980 and a family pitch and put within the park along with a fishing and a club on the lake.EventsHimley Park is now a premier events venue playing host to a variety of outdoor events from garden plant fairs and classic vehicle shows to the Himley fireworks display. Himley Hall supposedly hosts the United Kingdoms second largest firework display (second to Towers) on Fawkes Night. On 4 November 2006, tens of thousands of spectators gathered to see the display, which is believed to have cost in excess of 100,000.On 3 November 2007, Himley Hall hosted another fireworks display. It had a film theme, with pyrotechnic displays navigating around well known theme songs. The event also provided a free bus service to and from the site to attract and encourage more spectators to come. Dudley Council has been criticised for sspending money maintaining facilities in Staffordshire, whilst closing down services in Dudley Borough.Dudley is believed to be the only British council which does not provide a civic bonfire in November within its own boundary.References*  Himley Hall*  English Heritage;Images of England, photograph and architectural description

Norite
Norite is a mafic intrusive rock composed largely of the calcium-rich plagioclase labradorite and hypersthene with olivine. Norite is essentially indistinguishable from gabbro without section study under the microscope. It occurs with gabbro and other mafic to ultramafic rocks in intrusions which are often associated with platinum orebodies such as in the Bushveld Igneous Complex in  Africa, the Skaergaard igneous complex of Greenland, and the igneous complex in Montana, USA. Norite is also the basal igneous rock of the Basin complex in Ontario which is the site of a meteorite impact and the worlds second largest nickel mining region. Norite is a common rock type of the Apollo samples. On a smaller scale, norite can be found in small localized intrusions such as the Gombak Norite in Gombak, Singapore.The name Norite is derived from the Norwegian name for Norway: Norge.cs:Noritde:Noritfr:Noriteit:Noritehe:lt:Noritasnl:Norietpl:Norytpt:Noritouk:

Payerne
Payerne is a municipality in the Swiss canton of Vaud. It was the seat of the district of Payerne, and is now part of the district of Broye-Vully.The Accident Investigation Bureau of the Swiss government is headquartered in Payerne, by Airport.()Payerne is also the home of a major airbase of the Air Force.( )HistoryThe earliest traces of settlements near Payerne include Neolithic objects and traces of a Age settlement.  There are also mounds from the Hallstatt and Latne cultures, including gold necklaces which were found at Le Bois de Roverex.  There was a celtic bridge and a Roman era road in the area of Les Aventuri.  There were Roman buildings within and outside the city walls, Roman cemeteries, and a dedicatory inscription of Publius Graccius Paternus.  During the Middle Ages, the village of Payerne first appeared.  In 587, Bishop Marius built the villa Paterniacum and a Chapel to St. Mary in the village.  The chapel later developed into a church.  The present Gothic building was built in the 14th Century over roman foundations.  It was renovated in the 1990s.  In the 10th Century, the Cluniac Priory was founded.  In 1033, Emperor Conrad II was crowned as the of Burgundy in the priory church.(Payerne is first mentioned in 961 as ecclesie sancte Marie Paterniacensis though this comes from a 12th Century copy of the older document.  In 1049 it was mentioned as in loco Paterniaco.  The town was formerly known by its German name Peterlingen.(Before 1302 the prior granted the citizens the right to establish a council and create a seal.  In 1348 the council created a charter which was formally recognized.  The of the towns Council of Twelve also served as the mayor and the town military leader or Bannerherr.  In the 16th Century a second twelve-member council (rire conseil) appeared, to handle trade disputes for which it was not necessary to call together all citizens and nobles.  The citizenry and the monastery were often in conflict with each other.  The town concluded treaties with Bern (1344), Fribourg (1349), the count of Neuchtel (1355) and Murten (1364).  In 1362 a hospital was built in the town.  In 1395, a schoolmaster was mentioned, and in 1449 there was a secondary school.(After the conquest of Vaud in 1536, the town was granted a privileged legal position by Bern.  The Schultheiss, who represented the Bernese interests, was a citizen of Payern, not a Bernese Vogt.  The Schultheiss was subordinate to the town military leader (Bannerherr), who was elected by the citizens.  The Bannerherr chaired the sixty member council, which was divided into the Conseil Premier Douze, the Conseil Second-Douze, and the Communaut which had 36 members.  The Communaut included representative from the village of Corcelles and the surrounding hamlets.  In 1769, the Council was reduced to 50 members.  The City Council building of Payerne was built in 1572, and since 1964 has served as the seat of the District Court.(Guillaume Farel and Pierre Viret began to preach the Reformation in 1532-33 in Payerne.  The town adopted the new faith even before the conquest by Bern. The territory of the Reformed parish coincided with the municipality.(A castle was built in 1640 on the grounds of the monastery as a residence for the Bernese representative.  From the early 19th until the late 20th Century, it housed the high school.  In 1688 the town created a council for legislative reforms, followed in 1689 by one for weights and measures and in 1699, one for the care of orphans.  The town had a court and an appeals court, with further appeals being sent to Bern.  In 1617, the town refused to recognize the rights of Vaud.  The city law was updated and printed in 1733.  The city had a doctor, a surgeon and a pharmacist.  Bern paid for three of the Regents at the College, while Payerne paid for a fourth.  Starting in 1761 there was a teacher for girls, and in 1784 a German teacher was provided.  In 1791 the town citizens rejected an order for forced labor on a nearby road and in 1795 they called for the division of commons.(In 1798 it was briefly the capital of the short lived canton of Sarine et Broye.  From 1798 until 1802 it was the capital of the district of Payerne under the Republics canton of Fribourg.  From 1802 until 2006 it was the capital of the district of Payerne in the canton of Vaud.In the 1830s and 40s the city walls and three gates were demolished, only the four towers still remain.  The former monastery town spread out in all directions, and grew gradually to meet the town of Corcelles.  The old councils were replaced with a five-member executive council and a 70 member city council.  The municipal elections of 1929 marked the end of the forty year dominance of the Liberals.  After the founding of the Christian Social Party in 1961, there was three year period of tensions between Catholics and Protestants.  In 1964 the town inaugurated its new City Hall.(GeographyFile:Picswiss VD-49-23.jpg|thumb|left|Broye river at PayernePayerne has an area, , of .

Clara_Blandick
 spouse         (divorced)Clara Blandick (June 4, 1880  April 15, 1962) was an American actress.  Her many film appearances include the role of Auntie Em in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz.Early lifeShe was born Clara Dickey, the daughter of Isaac B. and Hattie (Mudgett) Dickey, aboard the Willard Mudgettan American ship captained by her father(oddly named after another of her relatives), and docked in Kong harbor. Her parents settled in Massachusetts, by 1880.(1880 United States Census Household Record: Isaac B. Dickey family from familysearch.org)ActingShe grew up in Boston, and there met famed Shakespearean actor, H. Sothern, with whom she appeared onstage in a production of the play Lovelace.  She moved from Boston to York City by 1900, and began pursuing acting as a career. Her first professional appearance came in 1901, when she was cast as Jehanneton in the play If I Were King, which ran for 56 performances at Garden Theatre (an early component of Square Garden). She achieved acclaim for her role in The Christian and was described by newspaper critics as a dainty, petite, and graceful heroine. In 1903 she played Gwendolyn in the Broadway premiere of W. Hornungs Raffles The Amateur Cracksman opposite Kyrle Bellew. She started in pictures with the Old Kalem company in 1908 and made a number of appearances like in The Maids Double in 1911. Blandick finally broke onto Broadway in 1912, when she was cast as Dolores Pennington in Widow By Proxy which ran for 88 performances through early 1913 at George M. Cohans Theatre on Broadway. During this same period she appeared on stages throughout the Northeastern United States as a member of Sylvester Polis stock theater company, The Poli Players.She would continue to achieve success on the stage, playing a number of starring roles, including the lead in Butterfly. By 1914 she was reappearing on the silver screen, this time as Emily Mason in the film Mrs. Black is Back. During War I, Blandick performed some overseas volunteer work for the Expeditionary Force in France. She also continued to act on stage and occasionally in silent pictures. In 1924, she earned rave reviews for her supporting role in the Prize winning play Fer Heaven, which ran for 122 performances at the Klaw Theatre in New York (later renamed CBS Radio Playhouse No. 2). In 1929, Blandick moved to Hollywood. By the 1930s, she was well-known in theatrical and film circles as an established supporting actress. Though she landed roles like Aunt Polly in the 1930 film Tom Sawyer (a role she reprised in the 1931 film Huckleberry Finn), she spent much of the decade as a actor, often going uncredited. At a time when many actors were permanently attached to a single studio, Blandick played a wide number of parts for almost every major Hollywood studio (though she would later be under contract with Century Fox). In 1930, she acted in nine different films. In 1931 she was in thirteen different films. As is the case with some other busy character actors, its impossible to make an exact tally of the films in which Clara appeared. A reasonable estimate would fall between 150 and 200.The Wizard of Oz and afterIn 1939, Blandick landed her most memorable minor role yet  Auntie Em in MGMs classic The Wizard of Oz. Though it was a small part (Blandick filmed all her scenes in a single week), the character was an important symbol of protagonist Dorothys quest to return home to her beloved aunt and uncle  a snipe at people who revere glitz and tinsel over a happy homelife. (Auntie Em and Uncle Henry are the only characters from the beginning of the movie not to have alter ego characters in the Land Of Oz). Blandick beat out Robson, Janet Beecher, and Sarah Padden for the role, and earned $750 per week. Some believed Auntie Ems alter ego was to be the Witch of the North but opted to use different actresses for each role rather than have a dual role for this. The reason was they wanted someone younger looking to contrast the good witch from the bad witches. Ironically, Burke, who played the Witch of the North, was only 4 years younger than Blandick.Though the Auntie Em character proved memorable to audiences, few fans knew Blandicks name. She was not billed in the opening credits and is listed last in the movies closing credits. After The Wizard of Oz, Blandick returned to her staple of character acting in supporting and bit roles. She would continue to act in a wide variety of roles in dozens of films. She played the spiteful Mrs. Pringle in 1940s of Windy Poplars, a surprised customer in the 1941 Brothers film Big Store, a fashionable socialite in the 1944 musical Cant Help Singing, and a cold-blooded murderer in the 1947 mystery Philo Vance Returns. Her final two roles both came in 1950  playing a housekeeper and a landlady in Key to the City and Love That Brute respectively. She retired from acting at the age of 69 and went into seclusion at the Roosevelt Hotel.DeathThroughout the 1950s, Blandicks health steadily began to fail. She started going blind and began suffering from severe arthritis. On April 15, 1962, she returned home from Sunday services at her church. Her residence was 1735 North Wilcox Avenue, Angeles, California. She began rearranging her room, placing her favorite photos and memorabilia in prominent places. She laid out her resume and a collection of press clippings from her lengthy career. She dressed immaculately, in an elegant royal blue dressing gown. Then, with her hair properly styled, she took an overdose of sleeping pills. She lay down on a couch, covered herself with a gold blanket over her shoulders, and tied a plastic bag over her head. Blandick left the following note: I am now about to make the great adventure. I cannot endure this agonizing pain any longer. It is all over my body. Neither can I face the impending blindness. I pray the Lord my soul to take. Amen. Her landlady, Helen Mason, found her body Sunday morning. In preparing to die, Blandick had disposed of all her medicines the previous week. She told James Busch, a friend for many years, that they might be discovered if anything happened to her. Blandick was survived by a niece, Catherine Hopkins, of California. The actress was married December 7, 1905, in Manhattan, to mining engineer Harry Staunton Elliott.() They separated by 1910, and are said to have divorced in 1912. They had no children.Blandicks ashes were interred at the Great Mausoleum, Columbarium of Security (Niche 17230) at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Glendale. Blandicks cremated remains lie just yards (Great Mausoleum, Columbarium of Inspiration, (Niche 14639) from those of The Wizard of Oz co-star, actor Grapewin, who portrayed her on-screen farmer husband, Uncle Henry.Partial filmography*The Maids Double (1911)*the Will O the Wisp (1917)*The Girl Said No (1930)*Sins of the Children (1930)*Romance (1930)*Tom Sawyer (1930)*Easiest Way (1931)*I Take This Woman (1931)*Adventures of Get Rich Quick Wallingford (1931)*Possessed (1931)*Wet Parade (1932)*Shopworn (1932)*Life Begins (1932)*Child of Manhattan (1933)*Turn Back the Clock (1933)*Chans Greatest Case (1933)*in My Heart (1933)*Bitter Tea of General Yen (1933)*Girl from Missouri (1934)*Bill (1934)*Wire (1935)*Divided (1936)*Adverse (1936)*Case of the Velvet Claws (1936)*Gorgeous Hussy (1936)*A Star is Born (1937) (uncredited)*The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1939)*The Wizard of Oz (1939)*Along the Mohawk (1939)*Swanee River (1939)*Dreaming Out Loud (1940)*North West Mounted Police (1940)*Wagons Roll at Night (1941)*Started with Eve (1941)*on Her Fingers (1942)*Dixie (1943)*Help Singing (1944)*of Death (1945)*A Stolen Life (1946)*Life with Father (1947)*Soft Touch (1949)*Key to the City (1950)References*Daily Tribune, Clara Real Ships Daughter, January 30, 1910.*Angeles Times, Actress Clara Blandick Plays Farewell Scene, April 16, 1962, Page A1.External links*****Clara Blandick as a young actress in The Actors Birthday Book by Johnson Briscoe (both 1908 & 1909 editions)*Clara Blandick as a young attractive actress, New York Public Library Billy Rose Collection*Clara Blandick portraits Univ of Washington Sayre Collection(enter her name)BlandickBlandick

The settlement is now a well known as a town as a result of the ore being exhausted.Ojuela was established after the discovery of a gold and silver mine in the area in 1598. The Ojuela Mine produced a large quantity of mineral during the last part of the 19th century. With the advent of the railroad, all the extracted ore were transported away from the mine by train and processed in the nearby town of Durango.The origins of the mine can be traced to 1598 when it was discovered by a group of Spanish prospectors. After this discovery, the mineral potential was confirmed and the exploitation begun. Soon the foundations of the town were set. The town was located at the top of a mountain within close proximity to the mines main access. This was done in order to have the workers and other mining staff closest as possible to the operation. The town developed rapidly from a small settlement to a village with all the urban services of that age. This included a office, Catholic church, several warehouses, general stores and saloons.At the end of the 19th century the property was acquired by the Peoles Mining Company. This was one of the first mining operations of this company. At the beginning of the 20th century there were problems with the mining exploitation due to the conflicts and struggles originated by the Revolution and with the additional problem of the water presence inside the mine. At the end of the revolution the operation continued but soon the mineral reserves were exhausted and the company decided to lease it to a local miners co-operative, therefore the town was gradually abandoned. Now there is no mining activity. However, there are a few fossil, rock and stone sellers and some tour guides.Currently the main buildings and other structures are in ruins. It is possible to visit this location and recognize the old church, the foundations of the miners houses, the warehouses, other mining facilities and to have a guided tour down the access of the former mine. The only surviving and functional structure is a bridge. The bridge is known as Puente de Ojuela (Ojuela Bridge) by the locals. The original bridge was designed by the famous Roebling brothers, who also designed the Brooklyn Bridge. At the time of construction, the Puente de Ojuela was the third longest suspension bridge in the world. It was rebuilt recently by the Peoles Company, the original was scrapped and only the main arches are now displayed at the Torren Exposition Center.Image:Recuerdo_del_Puente_de_Ojuela_-_Gold_Mine_-_1892_-_near_Torreon,_Mexico_005-800X600.jpg|The Ojuela Bridge in Mapimi, Durango, MexicoImage:Recuerdo_del_Puente_de_Ojuela_-_Gold_Mine_-_1892_-_near_Torreon,_Mexico_008-800X600.jpg|The Ojuela BridgeImage:Recuerdo_del_Puente_de_Ojuela_-_Gold_Mine_-_1892_-_near_Torreon,_Mexico_009-800X600.jpg|The Ojuela BridgeMinerals from OjuelaThe mine is known among mineral collectors for its minerals.

Opata_people
Opata (pronounced h-pah-tah) is the collective name for three peoples native to the northern Mexican border state of Sonora. The whole of Opata territory encompasses the northeasterly and central part of the state.  Most Opatan villages and subsequent towns have always been situated in valleys.The largest of the three Opatan groups are the Eudeve, (eh-oo-deh-veh), whose ancient villages and current towns encompass the northwestern, western half, and southerly portions of traditional Opata territory. The Eudeve also referred to themselves for short as Deve.  Both names mean people.The second largest group is the Teguima or Tehuima ( teh-wee-mah), whose ancient villages and current towns encompass the northeastern portion of Opata territory.  Tehuima means river people.The smallest Opatan group was the Jova (ho-vah).  Jova means water people. They originally consisted of eight villages in the southeastern portion of Opata territory.   By the 17th century the Jovas had inter-married with neighboring Eudeves to the extent where they evolved into a non-distinct indigenous ethnic group.Several early Spanish Franciscan missionary records and subsequent anthropological accounts state that Opata was borrowed from a Pima Indian word meaning enemy, which is what the northern and southern Piman peoples allegedly referred to their Opatan neighbors as.   However, both contemporary Piman-speakers and Opatan traditionalists deny this, being that opata was never a word for enemy in the Oodham language, and the Opatan and Oodham peoples were never known to have any major conflicts with one another to the extent of regarding one another as enemies.According to Opatan oral traditionalists, Opata is what some Tehuima villages referred to themselves as, and that it means iron people, being that iron ore was abundant in Opata territory, and Opata spear tips were made from iron ore.  Thus, those Tehuiman tribes were also known as the iron spear people.It has also been reported in a few anthropological texts that the Opata referred to themselves collectively in their own language as Joylraua.  However, according to Opata oral traditionalists, Joylraua was the name of an ancient Eudeve village that was named after an honored chieftain of that village.Being that the three Opatan dialects are intelligible with one another; all three linguistic groups were adjacent to one another territorially, and the traditions, customs, and religious beliefs of all three peoples were virtually identical, Franciscan missionaries from Spain, who were the first Europeans to make contact with them, eventually lumped them anthropologically all into one group known as Opata, collectively making them the largest indigenous nation in Sonora.Opata populationEarly Franciscan accounts of the Eudeve, Tehuima, and Jova populations combined estimated the Opatan population to number about 20,000. Today there are no known full-blooded Opatas left, but mestizo descendants still make up the vast majority population of traditional Opata territory, known in Spanish as opatera (Opata Country).  Today many Opata descendants reside in other parts of Sonora, Mexico, and the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona where their ancestors migrated to work in agriculture and mining. They mined bubbles.Opatan sustenance and attireThe Opatan peoples survived off of hunting game with and arrows; fishing with spears and nets; the gathering of wild fruit and cactus, and the planting and harvesting of various legumes such as corn, beans, and squash.They also produced a fermented maize atole beverage known as tanori, which was normally drank during certain ceremonies and celebrations. (Expert preparers of that beverage often took on the second name of Tanori).Women wove, dyed and wore full-length colorful fiber dresses.  Men generally dressed more scantily in skirts made of hide, but also wore serapes (shawls) in cold weather.  Footwear consisted of sandals made from hide. Women often only wore hide skirts similar to those of men during warm weather, and both sexes often went about nude during the hot season. Necklaces and other adornments made from hide, stone, bone, shell, and feathers were worn.Dwellings consisted of thatched huts and small houses made of adobe and zacate with thatched roofs. During warm, dry seasons, semi-subterranean dwellings known as a huki were also used.  (In addition, hukis were used as lodges, and small ones were constructed for the purpose of storing legumes to keep them cool and fresh longer).Opatan languagesThe Eudeve, Tehuima, and Jova dialects are members of the greater mother Uto-Aztecan family of languages.  Many words are the same or very similar to those in the Oodham (Pima and Papago), Raramuri (Tarahumara), and Chita (Yaqui and Mayo) languages.  However, the Opatan peoples are not of Piman stock or a subgroup of the Oodham peoples as alleged by some anthropological writings about them.The name of the Eudeve dialect is Dohema.  The Tehuimas spoke Tehuima, and the Jovas spoke Jova.  All three dialects are intelligble with one another.Due to their amalgamation with the Eudeves by the 17th century, the Jova dialect became extinct by the 18th century.During the 1993 census in Mexico, 12 persons interviewed for that census claimed to be Opata speakers.  If they indeed were, the dialect was most likely Dohema, being that as indicated previously, Jova had died out before the 18th century, and Tehuima was believed to have become extinct by the early 20th century.  However, there were known Dohema speakers in Eudeve territory as late as the 1950s.Except for a few Opatan names of people, the sound of the letter L does not exist in the Opatan dialects, and neither do plurals. For example, in the Cahita language of the Yaqui and Mayo, water is bah, and the waters (as in river, stream, or spring) is bahm.  In the three Opatan dialects, both water and waters are bah.The Opatan dialects are among the easier Amerindian languages for native speakers of European languages to learn and pronounce because they are non-tonal, and most words include vowels.  Many Opatan words and names in fact are easily mistaken for Italian or Japanese when viewed grammatically in the alphabet.Professor Manuel Garca Madrid, an Opata from Sonora, has published a linguistic text,  Ha Tehuikatzion, on the Tehuima dialect.American anthropologist David L. Schaul has done extensive research and published much material on the Eudeve dialect.Field anthropologist Campbell Pennington researched and published much information on the Opatan peoples and their dialects during the latter part of the 20th century.Traditional lifestyle, kinship, and social organization of the Opatan peoplesMost of Opata Country consists of a series of river valleys surrounded by mountain ranges. Most Eudeve, Tehuima, and Jova villages were small and were situated along the rivers, just as many municipalities in Opata Country are today.Traditional Opatan society was matrilineal in kinship, and politically, there was no form of monarchy. Each Opata village, which was also considered a clan, had a small of elders consisting of both men and women.  One of them, usually in relation to age, would be designated as the village chieftain.  The chieftain was not a dictator, but the villages senior advisor, mediator, and spokesperson.Other positions of leadership consisted of militia and hunting captains, which were normally held by male elders.Opatan villages included a nemtz (shaman) who was a combination naturopathic physician or curandero, sorcerer, and spiritual and ceremonial leader, adviser, and teacher. The majority of village nemtz were male, but some had female shamans, including apprentices.Opatan coming of age and social bondingBecause most villages in Opata Country were small, romantic marital bonds primarily consisted of one man and one woman, although some village chieftains and shamans, particularly those who were male, were known to have more than one spouse.There were no marriages or marriage ceremonies.  People would just bond romantically and begin living together under the same roof.Most women married and began having children by their mid-teens. Husbands were usually slightly older adolescents or young adults.  The average Opatan family included an average of two-to-three offspring.The onset of puberty was regarded as the first stage of adulthood as opposed to (adolescence) being the final stage of childhood.Informal divorce was not uncommon.  Some Opata individuals would have an average of two or three spouses at different times during their lifetimes, and new potential partners often came from different villages.  Pre-adolescent children of parents who broke up would normally remain with the mother.Opatan sexual mores and family planningHomosexuality and transgenderism were not taboo in traditional Opatan society.  couples existed in some villages, including effeminate males who dressed and lived as women.  Some of them were among the spouses in the marriages of chieftains and shamans.  Emasculate lesbians served as hunters and warriors.  Some shamans were hmari--the Opatan term for a two spirit person (homosexual or transvestite).Also not taboo in traditional Opata culture were pre-romantic relationship (marital) recreational sex, consensual sex, and sex orgies, which a few early Franciscan priests in Opata Country wrote about in their journals.rites also took place.  The most common one described as obscene in Spanish Franciscan accounts was known as the mariachi.The only sexual taboos in traditional Opatan society were forcible rape, sexual contact with prepubescent children on the part of pubescent people, and intercourse with a woman during her menstrual cycle.Abortion was not taboo in Opatan society due to the belief that the soul did not inhabit an infant until its first breath of life outside of the womb.  Abortion was thus exercised as a means of control during the trimester of pregnancy with the use of medicinal plants known as purgas.  If a purga failed to induce a miscarriage, the woman utilized a surgical procedure by inserting a special blade made of stone or bone into her uterus.Overview of traditional Opatan cosmology, religion, and ritesThe traditional pre-Columbian spirituality of the Opatan peoples was a mixture of monism, limited demi-deity polytheism, pantheism, and animism.Chamahua is the name the Opata give to the principal and ultimate formless source of all that exists, and which has no beginning, end, or humanly explainable purpose.  All life forms are inter-connected with one another within the infinite body of Chamahua.The sparks of Chamahuas active energy of light are the source of all individual life forms, including the souls of man.Chamahua means From which all things flow.Chamahua emanates two energies that result in opposites in many aspects of existence. In the physical universe, such opposites include light and darkness, heat and cold, motion and stillness, masculine and feminine, love and hate, and good and evil.Chamahua does not possess a human-like ego or cravings, which is why Chamahua does not require or desire people to worship it or even believe in it.The nature of Chamahua cannot be described any further in words.  It can only be experienced directly through silent, individual perception, which methods are initially taught to the young by the elders and shamans.The four principal demi-deities are the God, which represents fire, heat, and light; the Rain God, which represents all forms of water; the Corn Goddess, which represents the worlds vegetation, and the Earth Goddess, who is also called Grandmother Earth, which represents all human and animal life forms on Earth.  Opata traditionalists believe that there are other demi-deities that serve other worlds and life forms that do not pertain to the earth world.The four said principal demi-deities were recognized by the Opata as the principal sustainers of life on earth.  However, like Chamahua, they are regarded as allies absent of human-like egos as opposed to deities that are to be feared and worshiped or who require austerities and sacrifices of man. Shamanic and collective village rites and ceremonies performed in their honor were/are nothing more than petitions for abundance or balance, such as in times of hunting, planting, drought or excessive flooding.  But whenever such petitions seemed to go un-responded to, the Opata regarded it as a silent reason on the part of the deities as opposed to a form of punishment, and as a sign to implement change, such as in the form of migrating to another area.Another important aspect of classical Opatan spirituality is the mescalito spirit ally manifested in peyote rite gatherings as a means of enhancing perception of and communication with the spirit world.The temascal (known in English as the sweat lodge) was also held for both spiritual and therapeutic cleansing purposes in a semi-subterranean huki.The Opatan peoples also performed a deer dance ritual similar to that of the Yoeme (Yaqui) and Yoerme (Mayo) peoples, which the latter two peoples still perform to this day. The dance was held as a primer for summoning and honoring the deer spiritually for their sacrifice as food and hide to the village by way of the hunters.Aside from the above demi-deities, Opata traditionalists believe in other spirit beings that assist individuals as well.Wing people are divine beings that have always existed in spirit form.  Spirit relatives are those that have lived as worthy human beings. They are called relatives or relations because many of them are believed to be the ancestors of human mortals that serve as the spirit guides of descendants who choose to perceive them.In relation to animism, Opata traditionalists also believe that spirit allies manifest themselves to humans in the form of certain species of animals, fowl, and plants as transmitters of omens, knowledge, medicine, and healing.  They include the eagle, hawk, crow, owl, wolf, coyote, wildcat, snake, and dragonfly.Opata traditionalists believe that the human soul is binary and that when the physical body dies, the soul divides in two.  One half incarnates into the body of a newborn human or other intelligent being upon its first breath of life outside of the womb to become the infants soul and primary life force.  The other half of the soul goes to a spirit realm, of which there are infinite varieties, and which can include total immersion into Chamahua when not functioning as a spirit relative about the earth plane.The Opata believe that free will exists to a certain extent in the spirit world as it does in the physical world, and that malevolent spirits and mischievous ghosts are the souls of people that lived evil or troublesome lives, and who elect not to move that half of their soul onto the spirit world away from the earth plane.  Animals and certain people can perceive their presence, especially when they behave mischievously or appear to them to get attention. Sometimes they make themselves appear as innocent children in an attempt to gain sympathy.  Nemtz and other holy people can exercise rites to expel them from that state of being.The Opatan account of the origin of life on EarthOpata traditionalists believe that all life forms on earth were born out of the muddy womb of Grandmother Earth, and that the first earth ancestors of humans were the fur people.   The seven races of fur people lived and behaved more as animals until the star people came to Grandmother Earth in the bellies of large birds and planted their seed into the fur people through the wind and the waters, which eventually created the human race.The star people eventually departed Grandmother Earth for other worlds and left most of their human earth children with Grandmother Earth.  One of the reasons for the star peoples departure was due to many of the elements of Grandmother Earth not being compatible with their bodies, which resulted in sickness. It is because of that blood inheritance from the star people that human beings are prone to suffer more illnesses, birth defects, injuries, and other physical and mental maladies than any other creature native to this earth, and why many women are prone to have more pain and complications with child-bearing than any other of Grandmother Earths female creatures.On the other hand, it is because of the more animal-like aggressive nature inherited from the ancient fur people ancestors that so many human beings, especially males, are predatory and aggressive towards one another on this otherwise naturally feminine planet.The classical Tehuima account of origin teaches that their village of Bacoachi is where the first Opatan people originated.Opata traditionalists teach that Grandmother Earth has gone through seven major cataclysms due to movements in the universe and due to her own internal movements and changes.Opata traditionalists do not believe that nature is either cruel, kind, or perfect, but just is, and as with many other world traditions, they believe that nature has a natural reaction to every action.They further believe that petitions of intent to the four deities and various other forms of spirit allies and relations can sometimes manipulate the forces of nature that are beyond mere physical manipulation and control. Successful manipulation through rites and sorcery, or a seemingly lack of response by such means, is recognized as indicated previously, as a necessary but sometimes not always understood condition.A traditional Opatan rite that was once held openly was one similar to Mexicos of the Dead, in which villages would commune with the spirit relations collectively during a moon day during the spring.The Opata and deathEuthanasia by hydroasphyxiation was exercised in cases of infants born with severe, debilitating defects. It was carried out sacredly in a river by a nemtz with the parents present.Some elders and younger people who became severely incapacitated permanently and unable to care for themselves any longer, and those who suffered from severe and painful, incurable injuries or illnesses also elected to be euthanized. In most cases it was carried out sacredly with the ingestion of a poisonous plant administered by the village nemtz with loved ones and other clan members present.The deceased were normally buried in a ground, although some people elected cremation on a pyre so that their ashes could be kept among their survivors in a clay vessel.Classical Opata inter-tribal relations and justiceThe Opatan peoples were generally peaceful and non-imperialistic. They held a universal ethic amongst themselves of not initiating aggression against other Indian Tribes and nations, particularly for the benefit of dominating more territory or stealing.  The administration of justice by clan councils for certain societal violations depended on the offense, which ranged from various forms of restitution; temporary or permanent banishment from the village or territory, and in severe cases, execution.Spanish encroachment into Opata CountryBecause most Opatan villages were small and scattered apart from one another, they were vulnerable to attack by marauding bands of Apaches that were mainly based in southeastern Arizona.  Because of that, the Opatan peoples by-and-large did not resist the encroachment of Spaniards into their territory, being that the Spanish soldiers had more advanced weaponry in fighting off the Chiricahua and could have eventually crushed the Opata themselves had they not been cooperative.But along with that cooperation and military alliance came the price of Spanish religious (Catholic) and cultural encroachment into Opatan society, which gradually suppressed many Opatan traditions into being exercised discreetly away from their villages during hunting and gathering expeditions that did not include the accompaniment of Spanish soldiers or Franciscan missionaries, and the eventual dormancy of many traditional beliefs, customs, and values.Among the most initial outspoken Opata opponents of Spanish encroachment, especially of that of the missionaries, was nemtzan (the shaman/s), who upon learning Castilian and being taught about Christianity and Roman Catholic doctrine, recognized that many of those doctrines conflicted with Opatan religion and culture.Opatas were not monotheistic and did not exercise creator-worship. Nemtzan questioned why the intelligent and almighty god that these yoris (non-Indian foreigners) believed in would create an imperfect world with imperfect people and punish people for their imperfections.  Many of the Biblical taboos, especially those religiously-defined wrongdoings they called sin that conflicted with Opatan social practices and moral values, made no sense to nemtzan either.Nemtzan also questioned why these Europeans seemed to regard this religion that originated in the far away land known as the Middle East as their spiritual and moral role model.  What was wrong with traditional indigenous European religions?  Did they not have any? Why was the religion that the foreigner Jesus taught superior?  Why did they accept the Testament teaching that this Jesus was the son of a god and a human virgin that was impregnated by a ghost, and is the only holy man to be accepted and revered? Why should the Indian people forsake their peaceful and harmless spiritual beliefs and practices for this foreign holy man and religion?  Why was the religion and the ways of the yori superior to that of the Indian just because they had wondrous tools, water vessels, and weaponry?The textbook Cycles of Conquest provides a brief 15th century Spanish Franciscan-documented account of an Opata nemtz who essentially confronted the Franciscan priest in his village with such questions. When the priests responses did not satisfy nemtzan, nemtzan told the priest that he and his brethren ought to leave the Indians alone and never return. Nemtzan then turned around and walked away.  The priest later recorded the incident in his journal that included the comment, He was obviously of the Devil.Nemtzan warned their people that compromising too many of their traditional ways for the ways of the yori and forsaking their religion for Roman Catholicism would lead to their children and future generations serving as the horses and dogs of the yoris. By that they meant, except for the introduction of the haro (parrot) brought to Opata Country by Indian hunters and traders from the tropical regions to the south, the taming and domestication of wildlife was never considered by the Opatan peoples or most Indigenous American cultures in general prior to its introduction by the Europeans.Engaged conflicts of the OpataOver the centuries, neighboring Opatan clans (villages) often ended up engaging in brief armed conflicts with one another. In most cases, the conflicts were initiated by some petty dispute between two or more individuals, which would then fester into more members of their clans backing them up. In many cases it was without prior consultation with the village chieftains and elders.Sometimes a village nemtz would end up being killed by warriors of a (temporarily) rival village clan as a result of being accused of putting a curse on one or more of their villagers in the way of a sudden major illness, injury, or death that struck.The chieftains and elders of the warring villages would eventually meet and implement a resolution.The indigenous peoples of Sonora (Opatan, Piman, Yaqui, Mayo, Seri, and Cocopah) were never known to initiate major, on-going conflicts with another to the point of becoming traditional rivals as were some other indigenous tribes and nations throughout the Americas prior to the 20th century. Contemporary Yaqui and Seri elders tell of petty, brief skirmishes between their two peoples in previous centuries, but again, not to the point to where they considered one another traditional rivals. On the contrary, those indigenous Sonoran peoples affected by marauding bands of Chiricahua Apaches based in the general area of northeastern Sonora and southeastern Arizona territory often united to fight them off.Prior to the 1850s, Chiricahua culture, as did some other indigenous peoples, held a predatory policy towards their indigenous neighbors in the way of invading, raping, and pillaging villages, which included the kidnapping of women and children.When Opatas captured invading Chiricahua warriors that were mature adult males, they would execute them whether they were wounded or not, and place their bodies far enough away from their villages to avoid exposure of the odor of decomposition, and as food for wildlife to consume except for one hand, which the Opata warriors would cut off and wear around their necks on strings of hide as war victory trophies.  They would also sometimes used a severed Chiricahua hand to stir their beverages in drinking vessels made from gourd or clay with as a further symbolic act of humiliation towards their defeated Chiricahua aggressors in the presence of their surviving captors.  After decomposition, their skulls and bones would be used in certain ceremonies as well.Surviving captors consisted of young Chiricahua male warriors (reported in Spanish Franciscan journals as being in their early teens), who were normally spared if not severely wounded. However, they would be tied to trees or wooden posts, whereupon female elders of the village would briefly burn their thighs with lit pieces of wood as a form of punishment and humiliation, as it was considered a humiliation for a male warrior to be punished in such a way by an old woman. The young men were not so severely burned that they could not walk. Upon receiving said consequences, they would be released without weaponry and forced to leave the village.  Those that survived the journey back home to Chiricahua Country returned there with a humiliating story of defeat burned onto their thighs.Some Chiricahua raiding parties included the young wives of warriors.  Those that were captured and not severely wounded would end up the wives of Opata men.  They would thus eventually learn the language and integrate into Opatan society.(Contemporary Sonoran indigenous traditionalists hold no animosity towards contemporary Chiricahuas. Often said peoples participate together at inter-tribal indigenous events in North America).Also between the 16th and mid-19th centuries, there were numerous incidents of Opatas, Pimas, Seris, and Yaquis forming alliances in response to excessive and unprovoked Spanish and later Mexican army aggression against some of their villages. Although Opatan villages tolerated the presence of yoris amongst them, they would not tolerate abuse.The Seri people have always been the smallest tribe indigenous to Sonora.  Seri elders to this day relate oral accounts of how the Opati as they call the Opata in their language, helped them defend their nation against oppression on the part of Spaniards and later Mexican government troops.Most of the Indians that fought on the side of Maximillian during the French-Mexican War were from Sonora, which is elaborated on in more detail below under Noted Opatas and History.Contemporary Opatan societyAlthough most residents of Opata Country today are of Opata descent and acknowledge it, very few Opata traditions are exercised by the general Opatan populace today, and their character is generally mestizaje (mainline Mexican mestizo) as opposed to a traditional indigenous character and lifestyle. Some have even gone so far (in objection of Opata traditionalists) as changing certain Opatan names that sound offensive in Spanish.  For example, the Tehuima town of Oputo was changed to Villa Hidalgo by the municipal government as a result of mestizaje-centric people making fun of the puto in Oputo. (Puto is a slang word in Spanish and Portuguese for male prostitute and also the derogatory equivalent of the English term faggot as in homosexual. In Portuguese, o puto means the faggot or the male prostitute).An oppressive Mexican general by the name of Ignacio Lpez Rayn renamed the Eudeve town of Nacameri in honor of his mother (Rayn) in the 1860s, and the municipal government has never changed it back to its original name.The name of the Tehuima town of Oposura was also changed in the 19th century to the Nahuatl name of Moctezuma, and the municipal government there has never changed it back.However, the ancient Opatan spring procession rite known today as the fariseo (with some Catholicism mixed in) is still exercised during week in most towns and villages in Opata Country, which includes the wearing of masks and the use of traditional Opatan instruments during the procession that include hand-held gourd rattles, bands of small ankle rattles, and hand-held drums. Masks often include traditional ones carved from balsa wood depicting various painted human and animal-like facial figures.Another ancient Opatan custom was the placement of a four-stations cross made of wood and covered with moss on the roofs of their dwellings, which were replenished with fresh moss at the beginning of each spring.  The cross represents the four sacred directions and the four seasons. Many Opatan descendants in Opata Country today continue to exercise this tradition in the way of placing such a cross on the front door of their homes.There are Opata elders who through oral tradition know a number of words and phrases in the Eudeve and Tehuima dialects, but there are no known fluent Eudeve or Tehuima speakers other than those alleged in the 1993 national census.  However, efforts are being made by some contemporary Opata traditionalists to revive the Eudeve and Tehuima dialects and have them taught in schools in Opata Country.Traditional Opata religion and traditional Opata cultural values that conflicted with Spanish/Roman Catholic teachings and attitudes went underground well before the 20th century, but have been discreetly preserved and exercised untainted by Christian/Roman Catholic rites, symbolism, and theology over the centuries by a minority of Opata elders from each generation who have passed the traditional teachings and ways onto select descendants of their communities, who in turn have exercised many of the ancient rites and traditions discreetly in caves and other remote areas of Opata Country. (Ethnologist R.W. Giddings documented that she happened upon such a gathering being held in a cave in Eudeve territory in 1959, but did not enter, participate, or inquire about it later).The old traditions are not shared with most contemporary Opata descendants in general and especially non-indigenous peoples due to their cultural indoctrination by Christianity and Euro colonization.  However, some among the minority of indigenous-centric Opata traditionalists are gradually attempting to revive many of the old peaceful Opata traditions and values among the general Opatan populace, and to petition the Mexican government into recognizing the Opata people as a living culture and nation that has just been culturally progressive in many aspects as opposed to becoming completely dormant or extinct language and traditions-wise.Noted Opatas and historySisibotari was a respected Jova chieftain known throughout Opata Country who lived from the late 16th century to the mid-17th century.  He served as a major intermediary between the Opatan peoples and the Spanish, which helped maintain peace between the two peoples during his time. (Sisibotari  means, The Great Lord).  Father Prez de Ribas described Sisibotari as, He was handsome and still young, wore a long coat attached at his shoulder like a cape, and his loins were covered with a cloth, as was the custom of that nation. On the wrist of his left hand, which holds the bow when the hand pulls the cord to send the arrow, he wore a very becoming marten skin.(http://books.google.com/books?idjD540sJ1cGcC&pgRA1-PA30&lpgRA1-PA30&dqsisibotari+He+was+handsome+and+still+young&sourcebl&ots-uu11yQ8zr&sig8Fi8idO9pXY5HkhB1EcVCuQ2y18&hlen&eiARzES5zxMZHWsQOmx_3ZDA&saX&oibook_result&ctresult&resnum1&ved0CAYQ6AEwAA#vonepage&qsisibotari%20He%20was%20handsome%20and%20still%20young&ffalse)Ignacio Dorame was an Opata Caudillo who led a large force of Opatas in the 1820s.  The archivo de la Mitra (or Bishops Archive) en Hermosillo contains correspondence from priests in the towns in eastern Sonora documenting his gathering recruits and rousing of the Opata in the region.  The archives of Moris, Chihuahua just across the border from Sonora, document his arrival there to gather support of the Raramuri (Tarahumara) people as well as the Mountain Pima in creating a Confederation of Native Tribes.  He was expelled by a General Urrea from Chihuahua.  Ignacio Dorame is also referred to as El Opata Dorame.Juan Tanori and Refugio Tanori were a pair of Eudeve brothers that lived during the first half of the 19th century.  Like their father Luis Tanori before them, they became respected militia chieftains among their peoples, and were commissioned generals in the Army by Emperor Maximilian during the Franco-Mexican War as leaders of the Sonoran Indian troops, being that Maximillian made a pact with the indigenous nations of Sonora, which consisted of allowing Sonora independent statehood in the form of an indigenous confederation known as the Confederacin India de Sonora if France won the war. The only stipulation after the war would be for the new Indian Confederation of Sonora to provide a percentage of silver mining profits to the French government, which the leadership of the indigenous nations of Sonora agreed to.  Therefore, most of the Indian troops that fought on the side of Maximillian during the French-Mexican War were from Sonora, even though their motive for doing so was out of aspiration for an indigenous state independent from Mexico as opposed to loyalty to the Crown.In fact, after that offer from Maximillian had been made, the indigenous leadership of Sonora advised President Jurez of it with the assumption that he would offer them the same deal, particularly since he was indigenous (a Zapotec from Oaxaca) himself.  However, he refused, stating that it was in the best interests of the nation to leave the Republic intact as it was.Juan Tanori was subsequently captured by the Army during a battle in the Tehuima town of Bavispe in 1862 and was sentenced to death by hanging shortly thereafter.Refugio Tanori was captured at the end of the war while trying to escape with a Yaqui general and some of their militia in a boat across the of California from Sonora to the California peninsula.  They and other captured indigenous Sonoran militia leaders that had served under Maximillian were subsequently executed by squad by for what was regarded by the defending and triumphant Mexican nationalists as treason against the Mexican Republic.In honor of those indigenous ancestors who fought for the ideal of an independent indigenous state of Sonora, some contemporary Opata and other Sonoran Indian traditionalists do not celebrate de Mayothe national Mexican holiday that celebrates the defeat of French troops and their indigenous allies at the of Puebla in 1865.  (Cinco de Mayo is more of a popular celebration among Mexican-Americans in the United States than it is among people in Mexico anyway, and is often confused by foreigners with Independence Day, which is observed on September 16).Alcal is an accomplished Mexican-American author of Opata descent who has included Opata themes in some of her works.Teresa Leal is an Opata-Mayo civic leader and founder of indigenous womens and indigenous peoples community health organizations in Ambos Nogales.  She filed as the co-plaintiff-appellant, with the Club (Grand Canyon Chapter), in a citizen law suit filed in the States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, against the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Section of the Boundary and Water Commission.References*Opatas Unidos Refer to the Files (Archivos), Links (Enlaces), and Photos (Fotos).** David Yetman.

Mountaintop_removal_mining
thumb|right|Mountaintop removal sitethumb|right|Mountaintop removal in Martin County, KentuckyMountaintop removal mining is a form of mining that requires the removal of the summit or summit ridge of a mountain in order to permit easier access to the seams.  After the coal is extracted, the overburden (soil, lying above the economically desired resource) is either put back onto the ridge to approximate the mountains original contours or dumped elsewhere, often in neighboring valleys.()( Mountaintop removal is most closely associated with mining in the Mountains in the eastern United States.Peer-reviewed studies show that mountaintop mining has serious environmental impacts that mitigation practices cannot successfully address,( including loss of biodiversity, as well as human health impacts from contact with affected streams or exposure to airborne toxins and dust.(OverviewMountaintop removal mining (MTR), also known as mountaintop mining (MTM),() is a form of mining that involves the topographical alteration and/or removal of a summit, summit ridge, or significant portion of a mountain, hill, or ridge in order to obtain a desired geologic material.The MTR process involves the removal of seams by first fully removing the overburden laying atop them, exposing the seams from above. This method differs from more traditional underground mining, where typically a narrow shaft is dug which allows miners to collect seams using various underground methods, while leaving the vast majority of the overburden undisturbed.  The overburden waste resulting from MTR is either placed back on the ridge, attempting to reflect the approximate original contour of the mountain,( and/or it is moved into neighboring valleys.(The process involves blasting with explosives to remove up to 400 vertical feet (120 m) of overburden to expose underlying coal seams. Excess rock and soil laden with toxic mining byproducts are often dumped into nearby valleys, in what are called holler fills or valley fills.(Appeals Court Upholds Mountaintop Removal Mining)()(Mountaintop Mining and Valley Fills in Appalachia (MTM/VF) - Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement)MTR in the United States is most often associated with the extraction of coal in the Mountains, where the States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that  of Appalachian forests will be cleared for MTR sites by the year 2012.()  Sites range from Ohio to Virginia.(Copeland (2004) pp.39) It occurs most commonly in Virginia and Eastern Kentucky, the top two coal-producing states in Appalachia, with each state using approximately 1,000 tonnes of explosives per day for surface mining.()  At current rates, MTR in the U.S. will mine over 1.4 million acres (5,700 km) by 2010,() an amount of land area that exceeds that of the state of Delaware.Mountaintop removal has been practiced since the 1960s.( Increased demand for coal in the United States, sparked by the 1973 and 1979 petroleum crises, created incentives for a more economical form of coal mining than the traditional mining methods involving hundreds of workers, triggering the first widespread use of MTR. Its prevalence expanded further in the 1990s to retrieve relatively low-sulfur coal, a cleaner-burning form, which became desirable as a result of amendments to the U.S. Clean Air Act that tightened emissions limits on high-sulfur coal processing.() Process thumb|right|200px|US EPA diagram of mountaintop mining: Step 1. Layers of rock and dirt above the coal (called overburden) are removed.thumb|right|200px|Step 2. The upper seams of coal are removed with spoils placed in an adjacent valley.thumb|right|200px|Step 3. Draglines excavate lower layers of coal with spoils placed in spoil piles.thumb|right|200px|Step 4. Regrading begins as coal excavation continues.thumb|right|200px|Step 5. Once coal removal is complete, final regrading takes place and the area is revegetated.Land is deforested prior to mining operations and the resultant lumber is either sold( or burned.() According to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), the topsoil is supposed to be removed and set aside for later reclamation.( However, coal companies are often granted waivers and instead reclaim the mountain with topsoil substitute.  The waivers are granted if adequate amounts of topsoil are not naturally present on the rocky ridge top. Once the area is cleared, miners use explosives to blast away the overburden, the rock and subsoil, to expose coal seams beneath. The overburden is then moved by various mechanical  means to areas of the ridge previously mined.  These areas are the most economical area of storage as they are located close to the active pit of exposed coal.  If the ridge topography is too steep to adequately handle the amount of spoil produced then additional storage is used in a nearby valley or hollow, creating what is known as a valley fill or hollow fill.(When Mountains Move by John G. Mitchell, March 2006, National Geographic  (3 September 2008))  Any streams in a valley are buried by the overburden.(A front-end loader or excavator then removes the coal, where it is transported to a processing plant. Once coal removal is completed, the mining operators back stack overburden from the next area to be mined into the now empty pit.  After backstacking and grading of overburden has been completed, topsoil (or a topsoil substitute) is layered over the overburden layer.  Next, grass seed is spread in a mixture of seed, fertilizer, and mulch made from recycled newspaper. Depending on surface land owner wishes the land will then be further reclaimed by adding trees if the pre-approved post-mining land use is forest land or wildlife habitat.  If the land owner has requested other post-mining land uses the land can be reclaimed to be used as pasture land, economic development or other uses specified in SMCRA.()Because coal usually exists in multiple geologically stratified seams, miners can often repeat the blasting process to mine over a dozen seams on a single mountain, increasing the mine depth each time. This can result in a vertical descent of hundreds of extra feet into the earth.( Economics Just under half of the electricity generated in the United States is produced by power plants. MTR accounted for less than 5% of U.S. coal production as of 2001.( In some regions, however, the percentage is higher, for example MTR provided 30% of the coal mined in West Virginia in 2006.(J. O. Britton and others, West Virginia, Mining Engineering, May 2007, p.125.)Historically in the U.S. the prevalent method of coal acquisition was mining which is very labor-intensive. In MTR, through the use of explosives and large machinery, more than two and a half times as much coal can be extracted per worker per hour than in traditional underground mines,() thus greatly reducing the need for workers. In Kentucky, for example, the number of workers has declined over 60% from 1979 to 2006 (from 47,190 to 17,959 workers).() The industry overall lost approximately 10,000 jobs from 1990 to 1997, as MTR and other more mechanized underground mining methods became more widely used.() The coal industry asserts that surface mining techniques, such as mountaintop removal, are safer for miners than sending miners underground.()Proponents argue that in certain geologic areas, MTR and similar forms of mining allow the only access to thin seams of coal that traditional underground mining would not be able to mine.  MTR is sometimes the most cost-effective method of extracting coal.()Several studies of the impact of restrictions to mountaintop removal were authored in 2000 through 2005.  Studies by Mark L. Burton, J. Hicks and Cal Kent identified significant state level tax losses attributable to lower levels of mining (notably the studies did not examine potential environmental costs, which the authors acknowledge may outweigh commercial benefits).(Burton, Mark L. Michael Hicks and Cal Kent (2001) The Fiscal Implications of Judicially Imposed Surface Mining Restrictions in West Virginia, West Virginia Legislature, Joint Committee of Government and Finance, June, 2001 Center for Business and Economic Research, Marshall University) Legislation in the United States In the United States, MTR is allowed by section 515(c)(1) of SMCRA. Although most mining sites must be reclaimed to the lands pre-mining contour and use, regulatory agencies can issue waivers to allow MTR.() In such cases, SMCRA dictates that reclamation must create a level plateau or a gently rolling contour with no highwalls remaining.()Permits must be obtained to deposit valley fill into streams. On four occasions, federal courts have ruled that the Army Corps of Engineers violated the Water Act by issuing such permits.(() Energy Company is currently appealing a 2007 ruling, but has been allowed to continue mining in the meantime because most of the substantial harm has already occurred, according to the judge.(The Bush administration appealed one of these rulings in 2001 because the Act had not explicitly defined fill material that could legally be placed in a waterway. The EPA and Corps of Engineers changed a rule to include mining debris in the definition of fill material, and the ruling was overturned.(() However, if passed, the Water Protection Act (H.R.1375), a bill in the House of Representatives, would revert this change by specifying that coal mining waste does not constitute fill material,() in effect disallowing valley fills.On December 2, 2008, the Bush Administration made a rule change to remove the Stream Buffer Zone protection provision from SMCRA allowing coal companies to place mining waste rock and dirt directly into headwater waterways.()A federal judge has also ruled that using settling ponds to remove mining waste from streams violates the Clean Water Act. He also declared that the Army Corps of Engineers has no authority to issue permits allowing discharge of pollutants into such in-stream settling ponds, which are often built just below valley fills.()On January 15, 2008, the environmental advocacy group for Biological Diversity petitioned the States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to end a policy that waives detailed federal Endangered Species Act reviews for new mining permits. The current policy states that MTR can never damage endangered species or their habitat as long as mining operators comply with federal surface mining law, despite the complexities of species and ecosystems. Since 1996, this policy has exempted many strip mines from being subject to permit-specific reviews of impact on individual endangered species.() Because of the 1996 Biological Opinion by FWS making case-by-case formal reviews unnecessary, the Interiors Office of Surface Mining and state regulators require mining companies to hire a government-approved contractor to conduct their own surveys for any potential endangered species. The surveys require approval from state and federal biologists, who provide informal guidance on how to minimize mines potential effects to species. While the agencies have the option to ask for formal endangered species consultations during that process, they do so very rarely.()On May 25, 2008, Carolina State Representative Harrison introduced a bill to ban the use of mountaintop removal coal from coal fired power plants within North Carolina. This proposed legislation would have been the only legislation of its kind in the United States, however the bill was defeated.( )()Environmental and health impactsFile:Hobet Mountaintop mine West Virginia 1984-09-18.jpg|thumb|right|The Hobet mine in West Virginia taken by NASA LANDSAT in 1984File:Hobet Mountaintop mine West Virginia 2009-06-02.jpg|thumb|right|The Hobet mine in West Virginia taken by NASA LANDSAT in 2009Critics contend that MTR is a destructive and unsustainable practice that benefits a small number of corporations at the expense of local communities and the environment. Though the main issue has been over the physical alteration of the landscape, opponents to the practice have also criticized MTR for the damage done to the environment by massive transport trucks, and the environmental damage done by the burning of coal for power.  Blasting at MTR sites also expels dust and fly-rock into the air, which can disturb or settle onto private property nearby. This  dust may contain sulfur compounds, which corrodes structures and is a health hazard.()A January 2010 report in the journal Science reviews current peer-reviewed studies and water quality data and explores the consequences of mountaintop mining. It concludes that mountaintop mining has serious environmental impacts that mitigation practices cannot successfully address.( For example, the extensive tracts of deciduous forests destroyed by mountaintop mining support several endangered species and some of the highest biodiversity in North America. There is a particular problem with burial of headwater streams by valley fills which causes permanent loss of ecosystems that play critical roles in ecological processes. In addition, increases in metal ions, pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids due to elevated concentrations of sulfate are closely linked to the extent of mining in West Virginia watersheds.(M.A. Palmer et al. Mountaintop Mining Consequences, Science, 8 January 2010, Vol. 327, p. 148.) Declines in stream biodiversity have been linked to the level of mining disturbance in West Virginia watersheds.() Published studies also show a high potential for human health impacts. These may result from contact with streams or exposure to airborne toxins and dust. Adult hospitalization for chronic pulmonary disorders and hypertension are elevated as a result of county-level coal production. Rates of mortality, lung cancer, as well as chronic heart, lung and kidney disease are also increased.(  A 2011 study found that counties in and near mountaintop mining areas had higher rates of birth defects for five out of six types of birth defects, including circulatory/respiratory, musculoskeletal,central nervous system, gastrointestinal, and urogenital defects. These defect rates were more pronounced in the most recent period studied, suggesting the health effects of mountaintop mining-related air and water contamination may be cumulative.(http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/06/110623090001.htm)  Another 2011 study found the odds for reporting cancer were twice as high in the mountaintop mining environment compared to the non mining environment in ways not explained by age, sex,smoking, occupational exposure, or family cancer history.(https://springerlink3.metapress.com/content/3h175p782691j628/resource-secured/?targetfulltext.pdf&sidknae0gv45rywwu452fnwjc45&shwww.springerlink.com) A States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) impact statement finds that streams near some valley fills from mountaintop removal contain higher levels of minerals in the water and decreased aquatic biodiversity.( The statement also estimates that  of Appalachian streams were buried by valley fills between 1985 to 2001.( On September 28, 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) independent Science Advisory Board (SAB) released their first draft review of EPAs research into the water quality impacts of valley fills associated with mountaintop mining, agreeing with EPAs conclusion that valley fills are associated with increased levels of conductivity threatening aquatic life in surface waters.() Although U.S. mountaintop removal sites by law must be reclaimed after mining is complete, reclamation has traditionally focused on stabilizing rock formations and controlling for erosion, and not on the reforestation of the affected area.() Fast-growing, non-native flora such as cuneata, planted to quickly provide vegetation on a site, compete with tree seedlings, and trees have difficulty establishing root systems in compacted backfill.( Consequently, biodiversity suffers in a region of the United States with numerous endemic species.() In addition, reintroduced elk (Cervus canadensis) on mountaintop removal sites in Kentucky are eating tree seedlings.Advocates of MTR claim that once the areas are reclaimed as mandated by law, the area can provide flat land suitable for many uses in a region where flat land is at a premium. They also maintain that the new growth on reclaimed mountaintop mined areas is better suited to support populations of game animals.(J.S. Gardner and P Sainato, Mountaintop mining and sustainable development in Appalachia, Mining Engineering, March 2007, p.48-55.) Books and films Many personal interest stories of coalfield residents have been written, including Lost Mountain by Erik Reese and Mountains: How One Woman and Her Community Won Justice From Big Coal by Penny Loeb. In April 2005, a group of Kentucky writers traveled together to see the devastation from mountaintop removal mining, and Wind Publishing produced the resulting collection of poems, essays and photographs, co-edited by Johannesen, Ann Mason and Mary Ann Taylor-Hall -- Missing Mountains: We went to the mountaintop, but it wasnt there.  In 2007, Pancake released the novel Strange As This Weather Has Been, the first major fiction work about the subject. Mountaintop removal is a major plot element of the 2010 best-selling novel Freedom by Franzen, wherein a major character helps to secure land for surface mining with the promise that it will be restored and turned into a nature preserve.()To date, Dr. Shirley Stewart Burns, a coalfield native, has written the only academic book on mountaintop removal, titled Bringing Down The Mountains,(New Book on Mountaintop Removal: Bringing Down the Mountains) which is loosely based on the 2005 Ph.D. dissertation of the same name.(Bringing Down the Mountains: The Impact of Mountaintop Removal Surface Coal Mining on Southern West Virginia Communities, 1970-2004) Cultural historian Jeff Biggers has also published The United States of Appalachia examined the cultural and human costs of mountaintop removal.In 2006, Pancake released the first comprehensive feature-length documentary on mountaintop removal, Black Diamonds: Mountaintop Removal and the Search for Coalfield Justice, a selection in the Documentary Fortnight at the of Modern Art. The film features Julia Bonds who won the 2003 Goldman Prize. A 2007 documentary, Mountain Top Removal, focuses on Mountain Justice Summer activists, coal field residents, and coal industry officials. On April 18, 2008 the film received the Reel Current award selected and presented by Al Gore at the Film Festival. Another feature documentary, titled the Future: Coal in America, was awarded the International Documentary Associations 2008 Pare Lorentz(Pare Lorentz in Wiki Lorentz) award for Best Documentary.()In 2011, the film The Last Mountain directed by Bill Haney detailed the effects on the land and people living near mountaintop removal and coal burning sites.  Maria Gunnoe, the 2009 Goldman Environmental Prize winner, Robert F.

Ailanthus_altissima
Ailanthus altissima ((), commonly known as tree of heaven, ailanthus, or in Chinese as chouchun (), is a deciduous tree in the Simaroubaceae family. It is native to both northeast and central China and Taiwan. Unlike other members of the genus Ailanthus, it is found in temperate climates rather than the tropics. The tree grows rapidly and is capable of reaching heights of  in 25 years. However, the species is also short lived and rarely lives more than 50 years.In China, the tree of heaven has a long and rich history. It was mentioned in the oldest extant Chinese dictionary and listed in countless Chinese medical texts for its purported ability to cure ailments ranging from mental illness to baldness. The roots, leaves and bark are still used today in Chinese medicine, primarily as an astringent. The tree has been grown extensively both in China and abroad as a host plant for the silkmoth, a moth involved in silk production. Ailanthus has become a part of western culture as well, with the tree serving as the central metaphor and subject matter of the best-selling American novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Smith.The tree was first brought from China to Europe in the 1740s and to the United States in 1784. It was one of the first trees brought west during a time when chinoiserie was dominating European arts, and was initially hailed as a beautiful garden specimen. However, enthusiasm soon waned after gardeners became familiar with its suckering habits and its foul smelling odour. Despite this, it was used extensively as a street tree during much of the 19th century. Outside of Europe and the United States, the plant has been spread to many other areas beyond its native range. In a number of these, it has become an species due to its ability to quickly colonise disturbed areas and suppress competition with allelopathic chemicals. It is considered a noxious weed in Australia, the States, Zealand and several countries in southern and Europe. The tree also resprouts vigorously when cut, making its eradication difficult and time consuming. In many urban areas, it has acquired the derisive nicknames of ghetto palm and stink tree.Descriptionaltissima drawing.png|thumb|200px|right|Botanical drawing of the leaves, flowers and samaras from Britton and Browns 1913 Illustrated flora of the northern states and CanadaA. altissima is a medium-sized tree that reaches heights between 17 and 27 metres (56 and 90 ft) with a diameter at breast height of about 1 metre (40 in).( The bark is smooth and light grey, often becoming somewhat rougher with light tan fissures as the tree ages. The twigs are stout, smooth to lightly pubescent, and reddish or chestnut in colour. They have lenticels as well as heart-shaped leaf scars (i.e. a scar left on the twig after a leaf falls) with many bundle scars (i.e. small marks where the veins of the leaf once connected to the tree) around the edges. The buds are finely pubescent, dome shaped, and partially hidden behind the petiole, though they are completely visible in the dormant season at the sinuses of the leaf scars.( The branches are light to dark gray in colour, smooth, lustrous, and containing raised lenticels that become fissures with age. The ends of the branches become pendulous. All parts of the plant have a distinguishing strong odour that is often likened to rotting peanuts or cashews.(()The leaves are large, odd- or even-pinnately compound, and arranged alternately on the stem. They range in size from  in length and contain 1041 leaflets organised in pairs, with the largest leaves found on vigorous young sprouts. The rachis is light to reddish-green with a swollen base. The leaflets are ovate-lanceolate with entire margins, somewhat asymmetric and occasionally not directly opposite to each others. Each leaflet is  long and  wide. They have a long tapering end while the bases have two to four teeth, each containing one or more glands at the tip.( The leaflets upper sides are dark green in colour with light green veins, while the undersides are a more whitish green. The petioles are  long.( The lobed bases and glands distinguish it from similar sumac species.The flowers are small and appear in large panicles up to  in length at the end of new shoots. The individual flowers are yellowish green to reddish in colour, each with five petals and sepals.(( The sepals are cup-shaped, lobed and united while the petals are valvate (i.e. they meet at the edges without overlapping), white and hairy towards the inside.((( They appear from mid-April in the south of its range to July in the north. A. altissima is dioecious, with male and female flowers being borne on different individuals. Male trees produce three to four times as many flowers as the females, making the male flowers more conspicuous. Furthermore, the male plants emit a foul-smelling odour while flowering to attract pollinating insects. Female flowers contain ten (or rarely five through abortion) sterile stamens (stamenoides) with heart-shaped anthers. The pistil is made up of five free carpels (i.e. they are not fused), each containing a single ovule. Their styles are united and slender with star-shaped stigmas.(( The male flowers are similar in appearance, but they of course lack a pistil and the stamens do function, each being topped with a globular anther and a glandular green disc.( The seeds borne on the female trees are 5 mm in diameter and each is encapsulated in a samara that is 2.5 cm long (1 in) and  broad, appearing July though August, but usually persisting on the tree until the next spring. The samara is twisted at the tips, making it spin as it falls and assisting wind dispersal.(( The females can produce huge amounts of seeds, normally around 30,000 per kilogram (14,000/lb) of tree.(TaxonomyThe first scientific descriptions of the tree of heaven were made shortly after it was introduced to Europe by the French Jesuit Nicholas dIncarville. DIncarville had sent seeds from Peking via Siberia to his botanist friend de Jussieu in the 1740s. The seeds sent by dIncarville were thought to be from the economically important and similar looking Chinese varnish tree (Toxicodendron vernicifluum), which he had observed in the lower Yangtze region, rather than the tree of heaven. DIncarville attached a note indicating this, which caused much taxonomic confusion over the next few decades. In 1751, Jussieu planted a few seeds in France and sent others on to Miller, the superintendent at the Physic Garden, and to Philip C. Webb, the owner of an exotic plant garden in Busbridge, England.(Confusion in naming began when the tree was described by all three men with three different names. In Paris, Linnaeus gave the plant the name Rhus succedanea, while it was known commonly as grand vernis du Japon. In London the specimens were named by Miller as Toxicodendron altissima and in Busbridge it was dubbed in the old classification system as Rhus Sinese foliis alatis. There are extant records from the 1750s of disputes over the proper name between Philip Miller and John Ellis, curator of Webbs garden in Busbridge. Rather than the issue being resolved, more names soon appeared for the plant: Friedrich Ehrhart observed a specimen in Utrecht in 1782 and named it Rhus cacodendron.(Light was shed on the taxonomic status of ailanthus in 1788 when Louiche Desfontaines observed the samaras of the Paris specimens, which were still labelled Rhus succedanea, and came to the conclusion that the plant was not a sumac. He published an article with an illustrated description and gave it the name Ailanthus glandulosa, placing it in the same genus as the tropical species then known as A. integrifolia (white siris, now A. triphysa). The name is derived from the Ambonese word ailanto, meaning heaven-tree or tree reaching for the sky.(( The specific glandulosa, referring to the glands on the leaves, persisted until as late as 1957, but it was ultimately made invalid as a later homonym at the species level.( The current species name comes from T. Swingle who was employed by the United States Department of Plant Industry. He decided to transfer Millers older specific name into the genus of Desfontaines, resulting in the accepted name Ailanthus altissima.( Altissima is Latin for tallest,( and refers to the sizes the tree can reach. The plant is sometimes incorrectly cited with the specific epithet in the masculine (glandulosus or altissimus), which is incorrect since botanical, like Latin, treats most tree names as feminine.There are three varieties of A. altissima:*A. altissima var. altissima, which is the type variety and is native to China.*A. altissima var. tanakai, which is endemic to northern Taiwan highlands. It differs from the type in having yellowish bark, odd-pinnate leaves that are also shorter on average at  long with only 1325 scythe-like leaflets.((( It is listed as endangered in the Red List of threatened species due to loss of habitat for building and industrial plantations.(*A. altissima var. sutchuenensis, which differs in having red branchlets.((Distribution and habitatA. altissima is native to northern and central China, Taiwan( and northern Korea.( In Taiwan it is present as var. takanai.( In China it is native to every province except Gansu, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Jilin, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Tibet.(The tree prefers moist and loamy soils, but is adaptable to a very wide range of soil conditions and pH values. It is drought-hardy, but not tolerant of flooding. It also does not tolerate deep shade.( In China it is often found in limestone-rich areas.( The tree of heaven is found within a wide range of climatic conditions.( In its native range it is found at high altitudes in Taiwan( as well as lower ones in mainland China.( In the U.S. it is found in arid regions bordering the Plains, very wet regions in the southern Appalachians, and cold areas of the lower Mountains. Prolonged cold and snow cover cause dieback, though the trees re-sprout from the roots.(As an exotic plantThe earliest introductions of A. altissima to countries outside of its native range were to the southern areas of Korea as well as to Japan. It is possible that the tree is native to these areas, but it is generally agreed that the tree was a very early introduction.( Within China itself it has also been naturalised beyond its native range in areas such as Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang.(In 1784, not long after Jussieu had sent seeds to England, some were forwarded to the States by William Hamilton, a gardener in Philadelphia. In both Europe and America it quickly became a favoured ornamental, especially as a street tree, and by 1840 it was available in most nurseries.(( The tree was separately brought to California in the 1890s by Chinese immigrants who came during the Gold Rush. It has escaped cultivation in all areas where it was introduced, but most extensively in the United States.( It has naturalised across much of Europe, including Germany,( Austria, Switzerland, the Pannonian region (i.e. southeastern Europe from Italy and Hungary south to and Herzegovina) and most countries of the Basin.( In Montenegro(Danijela Steevi, Danka Petrovi Preliminary list of plant invaders in Montenegro (page 38), June, 2010) and Albania(PGR Forum Crop Wild Relative Catalogue for Europe and the Mediterranean)() A. altissima is widespread in both rural and urban areas and while in the first it was introduced as an ornamental plant, it very soon invaded native ecosystems with disastrous results and became an invasive species.( Ailanthus has also been introduced to Argentina,( Australia (where it is a declared weed in New South Wales and Victoria),( Zealand (where it is listed under the Pest Plant Accord and is classed an unwanted organism),( the Middle East and in some countries in South Asia such as Pakistan.(In America, A. altissima is present from Massachusetts in the east, west to southern Ontario, southwest to Iowa, south to Texas, and east to the north of Florida. On the west coast it is found from Mexico west to California and north to Washington.(( In the east of its range it grows most extensively in disturbed areas of cities, where it was long ago present as a planted street tree.(( It also grows along roads and railways. For example, a 2003 study in Carolina found the tree of heaven was present on 1.7% of all highway and railroad edges in the state and had been expanding its range at the rate of 4.76% counties per year.( Similarly, another study conducted in southwestern Virginia determined that the tree of heaven is thriving along approximately 30% of the states interstate highway system length or mileage.( It sometimes enters undisturbed areas as well and competes with native plants.( In western North America it is most common in mountainous areas around old dwellings and abandoned mining operations.((EcologyFile:Ailanthus-altissima.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A female bearing a heavy load of seeds in Valladolid, SpainAilanthus is an opportunistic plant that thrives in full sun and disturbed areas. It spreads aggressively both by seeds and vegetatively by sprouts, re-sprouting rapidly after being cut.( It is considered a shade-intolerant tree and cannot compete in low-light situations,( though it is sometimes found competing with hardwoods, but such competition rather indicates it was present at the time the stand was established.( On the other hand, a study in an old-growth hemlock-hardwood forest in York found that Ailanthus was capable of competing successfully with native trees in canopy gaps where only 2 to 15% of full sun was available. The same study characterised the tree as using a gap-obligate strategy in order to reach the forest canopy, meaning it grows rapidly during a very short period rather than growing slowly over a long period.( It is a short lived tree in any location and rarely lives more than 50 years.( Ailanthus is among the most pollution-tolerant of tree species, including dioxide, which it absorbs in its leaves. It can withstand cement dust and fumes from coal tar operations, as well as resist ozone exposure relatively well. Furthermore, high concentrations of mercury have been found built up in tissues of the plant.(Ailanthus has been used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine drainage has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system.( It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes.( Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.(File:Ailanthus altissima (female).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Female tree growing in Illinois Ailanthus produces an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits the growth of other plants.( The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrastii), bristlegrass (Setaria glauca), grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv. Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings with the exception of velvetleaf, which showed some resistance.( Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (americana) being the only plant not adversely affected.( The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heavens own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity.( Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.(The tree of heaven is a very rapidly growing tree, possibly the fastest growing tree in North America.( Growth of one to two metres (3.3 to 6.6 ft) per year for the first four years is considered normal. Shade considerably hampers growth rates. Older trees, while growing much slower, still do so faster than other trees. Studies found that Californian trees grew faster than their East Coast counterparts, and American trees in general grew faster than Chinese ones.(In Europe the tree of heaven was not considered naturalised in cities until after the World War. This has been attributed to the trees ability to colonise areas of rubble of destroyed buildings where most other plants would not grow.( In addition, the warmer microclimate in cities offers a more suitable habitat than the surrounding rural areas. For example, one study in Germany found the tree of heaven growing in 92% of densely populated areas of Berlin, 25% of its suburbs and only 3% of areas outside the city altogether.( In other areas of Europe this is not the case as climates are mild enough for the tree to flourish. It has colonised natural areas in Hungary, for example, and is considered a threat to biodiversity at that countrys National Park.(Several species of Lepidoptera utilise the leaves of ailanthus as food, including the moon moth (Actias selene) and the common grass yellow (Eurema hecabe). In North America the tree is the host plant for the webworm (Atteva aurea), though this moth is native to Central and America and originally used other members of the mostly tropical Simaroubaceae as its hosts.( In its native range A. altissima is associated with at least 32 species of arthropods and 13 species of fungi.(Due to the tree of heavens weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control in order to keep its populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an eradication program for the tree.( It can be very difficult to eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. It involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.((For a more thorough discussion, see the entry for Ailanthus ailtissima in the Wikimanual of Gardening at Wikibooks.)UsesFile:Samia cynthia adult male sjh.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A male ailanthus silkmoth from the A&M University insect collectionIn addition to its use as an ornamental plant, the tree of heaven is also used for its wood, medicinal properties, and as a host plant to feed silkworms of the moth cynthia, which produces silk that is stronger and cheaper than mulberry silk, although with inferior gloss and texture. It is also unable to take dye. This type of silk is known under various names: pongee, silk and Shantung silk, the last name being derived from Province in China where this silk is often produced. Its production is particularly well known in the Yantai region of that province. The moth has also been introduced in the United States.(The pale yellow, close-grained and satiny wood of ailanthus has been used in cabinet work.( It is flexible and well suited to the manufacture of kitchen steamers, which are important in cuisine for cooking mantou, pastries and rice. Province in eastern China is most famous for producing these steamers.( It is also considered a good source of firewood across much of its range as it moderately hard and heavy, yet readily available.( There are problems with using the wood as lumber, however. Because the trees exhibit rapid growth for the first few years, the trunk has uneven texture between the inner and outer wood, which can cause the wood to twist or crack during drying. Techniques have been developed for drying the wood so as to prevent this cracking, allowing it to be commercially harvested. Although the live tree tends to have very flexible wood, the wood is quite hard once properly dried.(CultivationTree of heaven is a popular tree in China and valued for its tolerance of difficult growing conditions.( It was once very popular in cultivation in both Europe and North America, but this popularity dropped, especially in the United States, due to the disagreeable odour of its blossoms and the weediness of its habit. The problem of odour was previously avoided by only selling pistillate plants since only males produce the smell, but a higher seed production also results.( Dirr, a noted American horticulturalist and professor at the University of Georgia, reported meeting, in 1982, a grower who could not find any buyers. He further writes (his emphasis): In Europe, however, the tree is still used in the garden to some degree as its habit is generally not as invasive as it is in America. In the Kingdom it is especially common in London squares, streets, and parks, though it is also frequently found in gardens of southern England and Anglia. It becomes rare in the north, occurring only infrequently in southern Scotland. It is also rare in Ireland.( In Germany the tree is commonly planted in gardens.( The tree has furthermore become unpopular in cultivation in the west because it is short-lived and that the trunk soon becomes hollow, making trees more than two feet in diameter unstable in high winds.(A few cultivars exist, but they are not often sold outside of China and probably not at all in North America:*Hongye  The name is Chinese and means red leaves. As the name implies it has attractive vivid red foliage(*Thousand Leaders(*Metro  A male cultivar with a tighter crown than usual and a less weedy habit(*Erythrocarpa  The fruits are a striking red(*Pendulifolia  Leaves are much longer and hang elegantly(MedicinalNearly every part of A. altissima has some application in traditional medicine. One of the oldest recipes, recorded in a work from 732 AD, is used for treating mental illness. It involved chopped root material, young boys urine and douchi. After sitting for a day the liquid was strained out and given to the patient over the course of several days.(Another source from 684 AD, during the dynasty and recorded in Shizhens of Materia Medica, states that when the leaves are taken internally, they make one incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally they can be effectively used to treat boils, abscesses and itches. Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, catalpa and peach tree to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.(The dried bark, however, is still an officinal drug and is listed in the modern Chinese medica as chun bai pi (), meaning white bark of spring. Modern works treat it in detail, discussing chemical constituents, how to identify the product and its pharmaceutical uses. It is prepared by felling the tree in fall or spring, stripping the bark and then scraping off the hardest, outermost portion, which is then sun-dried, soaked in water, partially re-dried in a basket and finally cut into strips. The bark is said to have cooling and astringent properties and is primarily used to treat dysentery, intestinal hemorrhage, menorrhagia and spermatorrhea. It is only prescribed in amounts between 4 and 10 grams, so as not to poison the patients. Lis Compendium has 18 recipes that call for the bark. Asian and European chemists have found some justification for its medical use as it contains a long list of active chemicals that include quassin and saponin, while ailanthone, the allelopathic chemical in the tree of heaven, is a known agent.( It is available in most shops dealing in traditional medicine.( A tincture of the root-bark has been used successfully in treating cardiac palpitation, asthma and epilepsy.(The samaras are also used in modern Chinese medicine under the name feng yan cao (), meaning herbal phoenix eye. They are used as a agent, spermatorrhea and for treating patients with blood in their feces or urine. It was clinically shown to be able to treat trichomoniasis, a vaginal infection caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis.( In occident, an extract of the bark sold under the synonym A. glandulosa is sometimes used as an remedy for various ailments including cancer.(Anecdotal evidence suggests that the plant may be mildly toxic. The noxious odours have been associated with nausea and headaches, as well as with dermatitis reported in both humans and sheep, who also developed weakness and paralysis. It contains a quinone irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as active quassinoids (ailanthone itself being one) which may account for these effects, but they have, however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in humans and goats. In one trial a tincture from the blossom and foliage caused nausea, vomiting and muscular relaxation.(Ailanthus altissima swingle has potent anti-anaphylactic and anti-inflammatory properties.(Kang TH, Choi IY, Kim SJ, Moon PD, Seo JU, Kim JJ, An NH, Kim SH, Kim MH, Um JY, Hong SH, Kim HM, Jeong HJAilanthus altissima swingle has anti-anaphylactic effect and inhibits inflammatory cytokine expression via suppression of nuclear factor-kappaB activation.  In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim. 2010 Jan;46(1):72-81)CultureChinaIn addition to the tree of heavens various uses, it has also been a part of culture for many centuries and has more recently attained a similar status in the west. Within the oldest extant dictionary, the Erya, written in the 3rd century BC, the tree of heaven is mentioned second among a list of trees. It was mentioned again in a medica compiled during the dynasty in 656 AD. Each work favoured a different character, however, and there is still some debate in the Chinese botanical community as to which character should be used. The current name, chouchun (), means stinking spring, and is a relatively new appellation. People living near the lower River know it by the name chunshu (), meaning spring tree. The name stems from the fact that A. altissima is one of the last trees to come out of dormancy, and as such its leaves coming out would indicate that winter was truly over.(In literature, ailanthus is often used for two rather extreme metaphors, with a mature tree representing a father and a stump being a spoiled child. This manifests itself occasionally when expressing best wishes to a friends father and mother in a letter, where one can write wishing your ailanthus and daylily are strong and happy, with ailanthus metaphorically referring to the father and daylily to the mother. Furthermore, one can scold a child by calling him a good-for-nothing ailanthus stump sprout, meaning the child is irresponsible. This derives from the literature of Zhuangzi, a Taoist philosopher, who referred to a tree that had developed from a sprout at the stump and was thus unsuitable for carpentry due to its irregular shape. Later scholars associated this tree with ailanthus and applied the metaphor to children who, like stump sprouts of the tree, will not develop into a worthwhile human being if they dont follow rules or traditions.()United StatesThe 1943 book A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Smith uses the tree of heaven as its central metaphor, using it as an analogy for the ability to thrive in a difficult environment. At the time as well as now, ailanthus was common in neglected urban areas.(( She writes:Ailanthus is also sometimes counter-nicknamed tree from hell due to its prolific invasiveness and the difficulty in eradicating it.(( In certain parts of the United States, the species has been nicknamed the ghetto palm because of its propensity for growing in the inhospitable conditions of urban areas, or on abandoned and poorly maintained properties.((Until March 26, 2008, a -tall member of the species was a prominent centerpiece of the sculpture garden at the Museum in the borough of Queens in York City. The tree had been spared by the sculptor Noguchi when in 1975 he bought the building which would become the museum and cleaned up its back lot. The tree was the only one he left in the yard, and the staff would eat lunch with Noguchi under it. In a sense, the sculpture garden was designed around the tree, said a former aide to Noguchi, Bonnie Rychlak, who later became the museum curator. By 2008, the old tree was found to be dying and in danger of crashing into the building, which was about to undergo a major renovation. The museum hired the Detroit Tree of Heaven Woodshop, an artists collective, to use the wood to create benches, sculptures and other amenities in and around the building. The trees rings were counted, revealing its age to be 75, and museum officials hoped it would regenerate from a sucker.(EuropeIngo Vetter, a German artist and professor of fine arts at University in Sweden, was influenced by the idea of the ghetto palm and installed a living ailanthus tree taken from Detroit for an international art show called Shrinking Cities at the Institute for Contemporary Art in Berlin in 2004.((NotesReferencesrefs()( AH654)()( GTR-SRS-062)( A 2-volumes modern facsimileis published by Eclectic Medical Publications.)()()()( FHTET-2004-05)()()(Dictionary of Botanical Epithets.

John_Thomson_(footballer)
 ntupdate  23 July 2008John Thomson (28 January 1909  5 September 1931) was a football goalkeeper for Celtic and Scotland who died as a result of an accidental collision with the Rangers player English during an Firm match at Ibrox.Early lifeThomson was born in Kirkcaldy and grew up in the mining community of Cardenden in Fife. His father (also called John) worked as a miner at the Bowhill Colliery, while his mother looked after the family home. He was educated at Denend Primary School and Auchterderran Higher Grade School. By then he was already a wonderful goalkeeper and was part of the Auchterderran school team that won the Lochgelly Times Cup. His teacher N.E Lawton said He was very keen on football, and was always training and hitting away at a punch ball. He was a born goalkeeper.By 14, he became an oncost worker at Bowhill Colliery, where his father also worked. His job was 300 yards below the pithead surface, uncoupling the chains of wagons that carried the coal up and down the tunnel.Club careerEarly careerBy 1924, John had started playing for the local side called Bowhill Rovers and the season after he joined Wellesley Juniors. The local newspaper Free Press reported that the club:A prediction that would come true but would be cut short by his untimely death.CelticCeltic manager Maley was looking for a goalkeeper and had heard of this young sensation from the east of Scotland. After playing against Denbeath Star on 30 October 1926, he signed a professional contract with Celtic for 10 at the age of 17. He was not the first choice goalkeeper at first and had to bide his time. After Celtic had won 6&ndash;3 against Brechin City on 5 February 1927, Maley was concerned with the way Shevlin had conceded three soft goals. In the next game against Dundee he decided to give the 18 year-old Thomson a chance. After then Thomson was able to hold down the position and he helped the team finish second in the league behind Rangers and win the Cup with a 3&ndash;1 victory against East Fife in the Final. The next year his work effort and team play was noticed by many, and one football journalist wrote:Thomson did play for Scotland, but the accident was also soon to come. His first major injury scare happened on 5 February 1930 against Airdrieonians, in which he broke his jaw, fractured many ribs, damaged his collar bone and lost two teeth. His friend Jim Ferguson said What was in his mind when he made the breakneck, goal-saving dives for which he was renowned. John replied that he thought of nothing but keeping his eye on the ball and if the ball was there to be won he had to go for it. Although John still continued to play football, his mother Jean tried to dissuade him from playing, as she said that she had a premonition of his death.The second medal that he won was also a Scottish Cup winners medal in 1931 against Motherwell. After a 2&ndash;2 draw, a replay was held in which Celtic won 4&ndash;2. These two Scottish Cup wins were the only two medals that he won with Celtic.International careerJohn made his first international appearance against France on 18 May 1930 in a 2&ndash;0 win. This was in the time before caps were awarded for matches other than Home Internationals (see Imlach), so Thomson won his first cap against Wales on 25 October 1930. He made another two international appearances for Scotland, keeping clean sheets against Northern Ireland and England.Personal lifeIn 1931, John Thomson became engaged to Margaret Finlay. John Finlay (the father of Margaret) who was General Manager of Edinburgh Collieries Company Limited was a keen supporter of Celtic FC. He was given a chance to become a director at the club but he refused as he was an Evangelical who attended the Church of Christ. However, he took his 5 children to weekly Celtic FC home matches. In 1930, they were introduced to John Thomson the Celtic international goalkeeper. John and Margaret were instantly attracted to each other and they soon developed a close relationship. Thomson became a regular visitor to the family home and Margaret was present at the Old Firm match where her fiance died.DeathOn 5 September 1931, Celtic were playing their old rivals Rangers at Stadium in Glasgow in front of 80,000. Early in the second half Thomson and a Rangers player, English, went for the ball at the same time. Thomsons head collided with Englishs knee, fracturing his skull and rupturing an artery in his right temple. Thomson was taken off the field in a stretcher; most people assumed that he was just badly concussed, but a few people who had seen his injuries suspected worse. One source said, There were gasps in the main stand, a single piercing scream being heard from a horrified young woman; this was believed to be the scream of 19-year-old Margaret Finlay, who was watching with Jim Thomson (brother of John). One Rangers player, also a medical student, said later that as soon as he saw him he gave little chance for his survival.After having treatment from the St Andrews Ambulance Association, he was taken to a stretcher. According to Scotsman he was seen to rise on the stretcher and look towards the goal and the spot where the accident happened. The game ended 0&ndash;0. Thomson was taken to the Infirmary in Glasgow.(Honour call for NI soccer star, News, 26 March 2008.) He had a lacerated wound over the right parietal bones of the skull, which meant that there was a depression in his skull of 2 inches in diameter. At 5pm he suffered a major convulsion. Dr Norman Davidson carried out an emergency operation to try and lower the amount of pressure caused by the swelling brain, but the operation was unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead by 9.25pm.His fiancee finally married a man called Charles Patrick Straker in December 1945, 14 years after Thomsons death. Their daughter Sybolla was born less than a year later. They later emigrated to Toronto, Canada, and Margaret was still living there at the time of her death on 16 March 1980 at the age of 67.(http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SOEfinlayM.htm)LegacyHis death shocked many people, and there was a well-known song, Johnny Thomson,(John Thomson Song, The) written to the tune of Arbor Hill. English, who was deeply traumatised by the event, was totally cleared of any responsibility for the accident. Even at the start of the 21st century Thomsons grave in Fife remains a place of pilgrimage for Celtic fans. On his gravestone it reads They never die who live in the hearts they leave behind.Celtic manager Maley wrote of him:Thomson was known for his incredible agility, bravery and safe handling, who produced some magnificent displays of goalkeeping.The journalist Arlott wrote:thumb|300px|right|Mourners and well-wishers lining the streets to see his sending off.Around 30,000 people went to his funeral in Cardenden (where he lived as a boy) on 9 September 1931. Lots of them had walked the journey of 55 miles from Glasgow. Another 20,000 turned out at Glasgow Queen Street station in order to watch two trains set off with two thousand passengers who could afford to pay the four shillings return fare.Sam English was cleared of any blame in the incident but he was jeered by Scottish fans afterwards and moved south a year later to play with FC. However he quit the sport altogether in May 1938, he told a friend that since the accident that killed John Thomson he had seven years of joyless sport.The John Thomson SongThe untimely death of Scotlands goalkeeper prospect John Thomson, had shocked the nation so much, that a song was dedicated to him:A young lad named John Thomson,From the west of Fife he came,To play for Glasgow Celtic,And to build himself a name.On the fifth day of September,gainst the Rangers club he played,From defeat he saved the Celtic,Ah but what a price he paid.The ball rolled from the centre,Young John ran out and dived,The ball rolled by; young John lay still,For his club this hero died.I took a trip to Parkhead,To the dear old Paradise,And as the players came out,Sure the tears fell from my eyes.For a famous face was missing,From the green and white brigade,And they told me Johnny Thomson,His last game he had played.Farewell my darling Johnny,Prince of players we must part,No more well stand and cheer you,On the slopes of Celtic Park.Now the fans they all are silent,As they travel near and far,No more theyll cheer John Thomson,Our bright and shining star.So come all you Glasgow Celtic,Stand up and play the game,For between your posts there stands a ghost,Johnny Thomson is his name.Recent YearsImage:Johns Grave.PNG|thumb|200px|right|His grave at Bowhill, Fife.In recent years, a book called My Search For Celtics John, written by Tom Greig, discusses his personal life and the fatal incident.(My Search for Celtics John at www.thethomsonlegend.com) Greig started a petition to persuade the Football Association to induct John Thomson into the Football Hall of Fame,.(Celtic FCs John Thomson - a biography at www.thethomsonlegend.com) In November 2008, this was achieved.(http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/spl/celtic/2008/09/24/celtic-legend-john-thomson-to-be-included-in-scottish-football-hall-of-fame-86908-20750737/)A local committee has also been set up called the John Thomson Memorial Committee. This organisation works to make sure that Johns name and achievements are remembered throughout the community and Scotland. Every year children in the Cardenden and Kinglassie districts play for the John Thomson Trophy to help ensure his name is perpetuated. On his gravestone, the simple inscription reads: They never die who live in the hearts they leave behind.1n 2009, a play written by Celtic historian David Potter was produced by children of the village and performed both in the village itself and at the Scottish Parliament before interested MSPs.September 2011 will mark the 80th anniversary of Johns untimely death and the John Thomson Memorial Committee (JTMC) will be working in partnership with Celtic Graves Society (CGS) on a Pilgrimage walk from Glasgow to Cardenden. The aim is to re-create the walk that many fans took 80 years ago to attend Johns funeral in Cardenden.The walk will start on Friday 2 September and arrive in Cardenden on the morning of Sunday 4 September to coincide with the annual John Thomson primary school football tournament which JTMC have organised for nearly thirty years.Following the tournament and a prize giving ceremony the Pilgrimage walkers will attend a wreath laying ceremony around 4.15 p.m. at Bowhill Cemetery.A play about John Thomson, written by Brian McGeachan and Gerard McDade will be performed at Glasgows Kings Theatre from September 5th to September 10th. The opening night falls on the 80th anniversary of John Thomsons death.See also*of footballers who died while playingReferences*External links*Newsreel of the incident -on 1.11 min, Margaret Finlay can be heard screaming *The Thomson Legend*John Thomson, the legend - Welcome to the John Thomson Memorial Committees Site*John Thomson lyrics*John Thomson at Spartacus schoolnet**London Hearts profile*John Thomson song being sung*Tribute page on Celtic FC net* BBC - Johnny Thomsons Ghost- the songThomson (Fuballspieler)ThomsonThomson (footballeur)ThomsonThomson (calciatore)

American_Silver_Eagle
The American Silver Eagle is the official silver bullion coin of the States. It was first released by the States Mint on November 24, 1986. It is struck only in the one-ounce size, which has a nominal value of one dollar and is guaranteed to contain one troy ounce of 99.9% pure silver. It is authorized by Title II of Public Law 99-61 (Liberty Coin Act, approved July 9, 1985) and codified as (e)-(h). Its content, weight, and purity are certified by the United States Mint. In addition to the bullion version, the United States Mint has produced a proof version and an uncirculated version for coin collectors. The Silver Eagle has been produced at three mints: the Mint, the Francisco Mint, and the Point Mint. The American Silver Eagle bullion coin may be used to fund Retirement Account investments.()DesignThe design on the coins obverse was taken from the Walking Liberty design by Adolph A. Weinman, which originally had been used on the Liberty Half Dollar coin of the United States from 1916 to 1947. As this iconic design had been a public favoriteand one of the most beloved designs of any United States coinage of modern times, silver or otherwiseit was revived for the Silver Eagle decades later. The obverse is inscribed with the year of minting or issuance, the word LIBERTY, and the phrase IN GOD WE TRUST.The reverse was designed by Mercanti and portrays a heraldic eagle behind a shield; the eagle grasps an olive branch in its right talon and arrows in its left talon, echoing the Seal of the United States; above the eagle are thirteen stars representing the Colonies.() The reverse is inscribed with the phrases UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 1 OZ. FINE SILVER~ONE DOLLAR, and E PLURIBUS UNUM (on the banner that the eagle holds in its beak), as well as the mintmark if applicable.Legislative historyBackground: Defense National Stockpile silver salesThe impetus of the American Silver Eagle bullion program ultimately comes from executive plans through the 1970s and early 1980s to sell off silver from the Defense National Stockpile. As the Street Journal explained, Several administrations had sought unsuccessfully to sell silver from the stockpile, arguing that domestic production of silver far exceeds strategic needs. But mining-state interests had opposed any sale, as had promilitary legislators who wanted assurances that the proceeds would be used to buy materials more urgently needed for the stockpile rather than merely to reduce the federal deficit.()() Throughout the period, such sell-offs that did occur, as well as announcements of planned sell-offs, caused immediate declines in the price of silver.() The Wall Street Journal reported in September 1976, When the US government makes noises about selling silver from the federal stockpile, futures traders start unloading futures contracts in speculation that such a sale would depress prices.()Despite congressional opposition()()() to the sale of stockpiled silver through early June 1981, the Armed Services Committee decided on June 10 to approve a Reagan administration request to sell government-owned silver beginning in fiscal year 1982 to help balance the federal budget.() In July 1981, the House and Senate agreed to allow the sale of 75% of the stockpiled silver (105.1 million troy ounces) over a three-year period(, and in September the price of silver fell 11% in response.() Just before the first sale in October 1981, a group of politicians from Idahoa major silver-producing stateattempted to block the auction, claiming that the sale could have a disastrous effect on the United States silver mining industry in general and several Idaho silver mining companies in particular.() On December 3, 1981, Senator A. McClure (R-Idaho) proposed an amendment (S.UP.AMDT.738) to the Department of Defense bill () to end the governments sale of silver until the President, not later than July 1, 1982, redetermines that the silver authorized for disposal is excess to the requirements of the stockpile. The appropriations bill was signed into law (Public Law 97-114) with the amendment intact, effectively stopping the further sale of stockpiled silver.()Coinage legislationOn May 27, 1982, Senator McClure introduced bill , A bill to provide for the disposal of silver from the National Defense Stockpile through the issuance of silver coins, to redirect the sale of silver from our national defense stockpile in an effort to minimize its affect sic on the already depressed price of silver.(National Security Silver Disposal Act of 1982, S. 2598, 97th Cong., 2d sess., Congressional Record 128, pt. 9:12321.) An identical companion bill, , was introduced on June 22 by Representative Larry E. Craig (R-Idaho) but both bills were referred to committees and never were enacted. The Wall Street Journal reported on June 30 that the price of silver soared after Interior Secretary James Watt announced that sales of the governments silver stockpile will be indefinitely postponed as the governments legally required study on potential methods of selling the silver had been delayed.()On January 27, 1983, Senator McClure introduced another bill () almost identical to S. 2598. As he had in the earlier bill, the senator asked,The bill was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs which held hearings on April 15, 1983, however, it was not enacted.(Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Gold and Silver Coinage Proposals: Hearing Before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, United States Senate, Ninety-Eighth Congress, First Session, on S. 42 To Provide for the Minting of American Gold Eagle Coins Pursuant to Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution and S. 269 To Provide for the Disposal of Silver from the National Defense Stockpile through the Issuance of Silver Coins, 98th Cong., 1st sess., April 15, 1983.)Some two years later, with sales still suspended, Senator McClure again introduced legislation aimed at requiring potential sales of stockpiled silver to be conducted through the issuance of coins minted from the silver. This time his legislation took the form of an amendment (S.AMDT.418)(Amendment no. 418, 99th Cong., 1st sess., Congressional Record 131, pt. 12:16799-16800.) to , the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Commemorative Coin Act. McClures amendmentthe Liberty Coin Actadded a new section (Title II) to H.R. 47. The amendment may be summarized into the following points:* Authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue silver bullion coins* Coin specifications including diameter, weight, fineness, general design, inscriptions, and edge finish* Coin sales* Numismatic and legal tender statuses* Purchase of silver from stockpile* Effective date of October 1, 1985, and stipulation that no coins may be issued or sold before September 1, 1986Proposed on June 21, 1985, the Senate agreed to McClures amendment by vote on the same day and it was added to H.R. 47; the House approved the amended bill three days later and it was signed into law by President Reagan on July 9, 1985. Thus, the authorizing law for the American Silver Eagle bullion program is Title II of Public Law 99-61 (Liberty Coin Act) codified as (e)-(h).Program extension, 2002The authorizing legislation for the American Silver Eagle bullion program stipulated that the silver used to mint the coins be acquired from the Defense National Stockpile with the intent to deplete the stockpiles silver holdings slowly over several years. By 2002, it became apparent that the stockpile would be depleted and that further legislation would be required for the program to continue. On June 6, 2002, Senator Reid (D-Nevada) introduced bill S. 2594, Support of American Eagle Silver Bullion Program Act, to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase silver on the open market when the silver stockpile is depleted. The bill was passed by the Senate on June 21 and by the House on June 27 and signed into law () by President Bush on July 23, 2002.()Minting historyThe first American Silver Eagle coin was struck in Francisco on October 29, 1986.() Secretary of the Treasury James A. Baker III presided over the striking ceremony held at the San Francisco Assay Office. According to a Sun-Times article, as Baker reached for the electronic button on press No. 105, he turned to the audience and said, I dont need a pick and shovel to start the San Francisco Silver Rush of 1986.()BullionBullion Silver Eagle coins do not have mintmarks. From 1986 to 1998, they were minted at Francisco. From 1999 to 2000, they were minted at Philadelphia and West Point. Since 2001, they have been minted only at West Point.In March 2011, the San Francisco Mint conducted trial strikes of bullion Silver Eagle coins in preparation for the resumption of full production later in the spring. The added production capacity provided by the San Francisco Mint supplements the output of the West Point Mint.()()ProofFrom 1986 to 1992, proof Silver Eagle coins were minted at San Francisco and these coins bear the S mintmark. From 1993 to 2000, they were minted at Philadelphia and these coins bear the P mintmark. From 2001 to 2008, they were minted at West Point and these coins bear the W mintmark.( No proof versions were minted in 2009. Beginning again in 2010, the proof coins were minted at West Point and bear the W mintmark.UncirculatedFrom 2006 to 2008 and beginning again in 2011, the United States Mint issued a collectible uncirculated Silver Eagle coin produced at West Point (bearing the W mintmark). The coins are struck on specially burnished blanks and sometimes are referred to as W Uncirculated or Burnished Uncirculated.()Special issues*In 1993, the Philadelphia Set was issued to commemorate the bicentennial of the striking of the first official United States coins at the Mint in 1793. The set included proof Gold Eagle coins in 1/2 ozt, 1/4 ozt, and 1/10 ozt sizes, a proof Silver Eagle coin, and a 90% silver proof U.S. Mint Bicentennial medal, all with P mintmarks.()*In 1995, in addition to the regular proof coin minted at Philadelphia, the United States Mint also issued a proof coin minted at West Point. Known as the 1995-W Proof Silver Eagle, the coin was sold only as part of the 10th Anniversary American Eagle Five Coin Set which also included the four 1995-W proof American Gold Eagle coins in 1 ozt, 1/2 ozt, 1/4 ozt, and 1/10 ozt sizes; 30,125 sets were sold.()*In 2000, the Mint issued the United States Millennium Coinage and Currency Set which included a 2000 Silver Eagle bullion coin minted at West Point (but without a W mintmark), a 2000 Denver-minted Sacagawea Dollar with a burnished finish, and an uncirculated 1999 series one-dollar bill with a number beginning with the numbers 2000. The sets sold out at the issue limit of 75,000 units. In fewer than twenty known sets, the Sacagawea Dollars do not have a burnished finish.()()*In January 2004, the Mint issued the Legacies of Freedom United States and United Kingdom Silver Bullion Coin Set which consisted of a 2003 bullion Silver Eagle and a 2002 Silver Britannia bullion coin from the Kingdom. The set had an issue limit of 50,000.(*To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the American Silver Eagle program in 2006, the Mint issued a special Reverse Proof Silver Eagle coin minted at Philadelphia. This coin was available as part of a 3-coin set which also included the regular proof coin and the new Burnished Uncirculated coin. The reverse proof coin features a frosted background and mirrored raised surfaces (the opposite of a typical proof coin of the series). Uncirculated Silver Eagle coins also were available as part of the 20th Anniversary Gold & Silver Eagle Set which had an issue limit of 20,000 (19,145 were sold) and included the one-ounce, 2006-W uncirculated American Gold Eagle.()*In 2007 and 2008, uncirculated Silver Eagle coins were packaged with each years issues of Philadelphia-minted Presidential Dollars and Denver-minted Sacagawea Dollars in an Annual Uncirculated Dollar Coin Set. The 2007 set became available directly from the Mint on December 3, 2007;() the 2008 set was available from August 7, 2008() to January 28, 2010.()VarietiesThe first significant variety of the Silver Eagle series appeared in 2008 and is known as the 2008-W Silver Eagle Reverse of 2007 Variety. The United States Mint made slight alterations to the reverse design between 2007 and 2008 and some 2008 uncirculated coins inadvertently were struck with the 2007 reverse type die resulting in a die error. The variety is distinguishable by differences in the U in UNITED STATES and the dash between SILVER and ONE.()Effect of recession on availability, 20082010As a result of the global recession, the demand from investors for bullion coins as a hedge against inflation and economic downturn surged.() This increased demand began to affect the availability of American Silver Eagle bullion coins in February 2008 when sales to authorized dealers were suspended temporarily. In March 2008, sales increased ninefold from the month before (from 200,000 to 1,855,000).(() In April 2008, the United States Mint began an allocation program, effectively rationing Silver Eagle bullion coins to authorized dealers on a weekly basis due to unprecedented demand.( At least one observer() has questioned the legality of the allocation program, as the of the United States is required by law () to mint and issue these coins in quantities sufficient to meet public demand. On June 6, 2008, the Mint announced that all incoming silver planchets were being used to produce only bullion issues of the Silver Eagle and not proof or uncirculated collectible issues.() The 2008 Proof Silver Eagle became unavailable for purchase from the United States Mint in August 2008 and the 2008 Uncirculated Silver Eagle sold out in January 2009 (however, it was available as part of the 2008 Annual Uncirculated Dollar Coin Set until it sold out on January 28, 2010).()On March 5, 2009, the United States Mint announced that the proof and uncirculated versions of the Silver Eagle coin for that year were temporarily suspended due to continuing high demand for the bullion version.() The allocation program that had been put in place in March 2008 was lifted on June 15, 2009, leading to speculation that proof and uncirculated versions might be produced before the end of the year.() However, on October 6, 2009, the Mint announced that the collectible versions of the Silver Eagle coin would not be produced for 2009.() The disappointment of collectors was expressed in a December 1 article by Representative Gary C. Peters (D-Michigan).() Peters offered alternative scenarios to the cancellation of 2009 proof and uncirculated Silver Eagles and explained that he would be sending a letter to Mint Director C. Moy urging him to begin minting these products as soon as possible and continuing to do so until the end of the year. This effort was not successful and the collectible versions were not produced. The sale of 2009 Silver Eagle bullion coins was suspended from November 24 to December 6 and the allocation program was re-instituted on December 7; the product sold out on January 12, 2010.()Production of the 2010 Silver Eagle bullion coins began in January of that year (as opposed to beginning typically in December preceding the year of issue) and the coins were distributed to authorized dealers under an allocation program until September 3.()()On July 20, 2010, Mint Director Edmund C. Moy provided testimony to the House Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology on the matter of proof and uncirculated Silver Eagle coins, referencing the possibility of a legislative solution. Moy explained:Testimony of Edmund C. Moy, Director United States Mint, Before the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology, United States House of Representatives, July 20, 2010()On September 22, 2010, Representative L.

The coins are sold to banks, brokerage companies, coin dealers, precious metal firms, and wholesalers that meet the following requirements:File:American Silver Eagle monster box from United States Mint.gif|thumb|right|A green plastic box used by the States Mint for shipping American Silver Eagle bullion coins.

Before shipping, the boxes are sealed with straps by the Mint and labeled with the year of issue and a serial number.()Proof, uncirculated, and special issuesProof American Silver Eagle coins dated 1986 through 2008 were sold directly to the public by the United States Mint at a fixed price.

Special issues and sets are sold directly to the public by the United States Mint.ValueAmerican Silver Eagle bullion coins carry a face value of one dollar. This is their legal value reflecting their issue and monetization as coins. Per , the coins are tender for all debts public and private at their face value of one dollar. This face value does not reflect their intrinsic value which is much greater and is dictated by their silver content and the metals spot price.Mintages, and thus prices, of bullion, proof, and uncirculated Silver Eagle coins have varied widely, and the potential collector is advised to check a standard reference book before buying them. Generally, the bullion versions have been minted in the millions, while the proof and uncirculated versions were issued in the hundreds of thousands each. Most dates of the bullion issue are not particularly expensive (around $50 as of September 2011) and are traded at a premium above the intrinsic value of the silver they contain; most proof versions (around $85$90 as of 2011) and uncirculated versions (around $55$100 as of 2011) sell for more. Some issues sell for significant sums, for example the 1995-W proof ($3,500 as of 2011) and the 2006 20th anniversary set containing a special Reverse Proof coin along with a regular proof coin and the new Burnished Uncirculated coin (over $300 as of 2011).()See also*the Beautiful Silver Bullion Coins  United States silver bullion coin program*Buffalo (coin)  United States gold bullion coin program*Gold Eagle  United States gold bullion coin program*Platinum Eagle  United States platinum bullion coin program*coin*Silver Maple Leaf  Canadian silver bullion coin program*as an investment*States dollar coinReferencesExternal links*United States Mint American Eagles page*Brochure from the United States Mint (2003)*Silver Eagle Guide*The American Eagle Silver Coin: History, Design, Prices and Mint Figures*American Silver Eagle Pictures at Coin Page Database*High Resolution Silver Eagle ImagesilwerarendSilver Eagle

Yanacocha
thumb|350px|gold mine Yanacocha near Cajamarca (Peru)Yanacocha  (Northern-Quechua / Inkawasi: yana  black; dark  --  qotra / qua  lake; puddle; pond; lagoon)(Vokabular / Simi Taqe / Simi Taqi / Simikuna / Shimikuna  Wortschatz, gesammelt von Philip Jacobs; runasimi.xls; http://www.runasimi.de/main-de.htm)  is a gold mine in northern Peru, considered to be the second largest gold mine in the world, producing over US$7 billion worth of gold to date. The 251-square kilometer open pit mine is situated about 30 kilometers (14 km straight line) north of Cajamarca, in high pampa, straddling the watershed. The Banks International Finance Corporation (IFC) provided loans totaling US$150 million for development and has a 5% equity investment in Yanacocha, which is run by the Mining Corporation, a Denver, Colorado-based company that is the worlds second largest gold mining firm. Newmont is the major shareholder together with Buenaventura, a Peruvian company. In 2005, Yanacocha produced 3,316,933 ounces (103,200 kg) of gold (INEI).OwnershipBefore 1994 the mine was co-owned by Newmont, Buenaventura (a Peruvian mining company), and de Recherches Gologiques et Minires (BRGM), a French government owned company. This partnership collapsed in 1994 after BRGM tried to sell part of its shares in the company to an Australian company which was a rival of Newmont. Newmont and Buenaventura would both go to court to challenge the trade.Kurlander, then a senior executive at Newmont, claimed the French President Chirac had sent a letter to then Peruvian President Fujimori asking him to intervene in the court case in favor of the French owned company. Kurlander had been sent by Newmont to Peru in order to try to get a favorable outcome for Newmont in the dispute. The legal battle would eventually make it all the way up to the Supreme Court.During this period Kurlander acknowledges having met with Montesinos, the Peruvian intelligence chief who has since been found guilty of embezzlement, illegally assuming his post as intelligence chief, abuse of power, peddling and bribing TV stations. http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/peru404/thestory.html  http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId4973736 However, Kurlander claims that he did nothing illegal and that the French government were taking similar steps in trying to contact Montesinos. The French ambassador to Peru Antoine Blanca denies this, pointing to the fact that Montesinos was on the CIA payroll and thus would naturally side with the U.S-based company.thumb|upright3|collecting water containing the extracted goldAfter the fall of Fujimori in 2000 a number of videos Montesinos had taped of himself meeting with several domestic and foreign leaders and offering bribes and accepting them had emerged. In October 2005 Frontline in co-production with New York Times found a February 1998 recording of a telephone conversation between Montesinos and Kurlander. The following is an excerpt from the tape::Kurlander:...we have a very serious problem in Peru with our company (Newmont) and Minera Buenaventura so I have enlisted the support of some of my friends from a variety of intelligence communities. I need it especially because the other side (the French government) has been acting quite strangely.:Montesinos (to interpereter): Tell him that I am perfectly aware of the problem he has and the people he represents have with the French, as well as the problem he has with the judiciary.:Kurlander: So now you have a friend for life. I want a friend for life.:Montesinos (to interpereter): I thank you very much for what you have just told me and well you already have a friend. Tell him Im going to help him with the voting. I would like to know the tricky practices of the French. The French Connection!:Kurlander: The French Connection!:(laughter) http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/peru404/web.html#Along with this telephone conversation, Frontline and The New York Times also re-broadcast three other videos. One was filmed in April 1998 and shows Montesinos talking to Don Arabian, the CIA station chief in Peru, in an attempt to get CIA to pressure the U.S to back Newmont in the case. In the video Montesinos claims to have found e-mails from Paris to Peru of French officials trying to influence the court to get a decision favorable to France.Another video recorded in May 1998 shows Montesinos meeting with Peruvian Supreme Court Justice, and former classmate, Beltran Quiroga.  In it Montesinos states that state interests are at stake in the case between Newmont and BRGM.  He tells Quiroga that if the decision goes to Newmont that the United States will back Peru in its border dispute with Ecuador which had a few years ago exploded into the War. He also tells Quiroga to deny any connection with him to the press. Quiroga would later play a crucial role in the case, his vote would be the deciding vote in the Newmont victory. After the video was first broadcast in Peru in 2001, on a Peruvian local television station the French Ambassador Antoine Blanca was quoted as saying Now I know why Newmont won. In the final July 1999 video, Montesinos is again seen with the now departing CIA station chief Don Arabian giving him a gift and thanking him for the help he has given Peru stating We hope that when youre back there Washington youll remember your friends. Environmental and Social Issues thumb||350px|renaturalized area (Aug. 2005)Local environmental activists claim that the mining operations, which use large quantities of a dilute cyanide solution, have contaminated the water sources, leading to the disappearance of fish and frogs, illnesses among cattle, air pollution, and loss of medicinal plants. An independent environmental audit by a Colombian consultancy firm {Ingetec S.A. Ingenieros Consultores: Auditora Ambiental y Evaluaciones Ambientales de las Operaciones de la Minera Yanacocha en Cajamarca - Per 2003} may have found some water contamination above permitted levels, and did recommend many improvements to Yanacochas environmental management practices.  However, the study did not examine claims of impacts on wild life, plants, or livestock,.(Halting the rush against gold, the Economist, 3 Feb 2005)(Report Of The Presentation Of The Final Report Of The Ingetec Environmental Operations Audit)  Yanacocha did undertake to act on the 309 Ingetec recommendations. Based on an Ingetec review in April 2006, Yanacocha had fully implemented 137, made significant progress on 111, and had started to address an additional 45 of the recommendations - representing progress on 90% of the recommendations in advance of the agreed 2007 completion date.(AUDIT AND ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION - INGETEC, Yanacocha,)In 2004, more than 10.000 people living in the Cajamarca area protested the expansion of Yanacocha onto nearby Cerro Quilish, a mountain that supplies water to Cajamarca. In response to public outcry, Newmont announced that further exploration would be suspended. http://www.sacredland.org/world_sites_pages/MtQuilish.htmlNewmont has also been involved in an ongoing conflict over damages resulting from a mercury contamination. On June 2, 2000, 151 kilograms of the toxic metal were spilt while being transported by a contracted truck from Yanococha to the Pacific coast, contaminating the town of Choropampa and two neighboring villages. According to government estimates, more than nine hundred people were poisoned.{Anaya, R. (2001). Acute elemental mercury poisoning in three locations of the department of Cajamarca-Peru. In: Toxicology, Volume 164, Issue(1-3): p. 1-266, p. 69}. After losing a three-year fight to keep the lawsuit out of US courts, Newmont announced at the end of 2004 that it would participate in settlement talks before two retired Colorado judges. But the mediation talks failed to produce a settlement and the plaintiffs, eleven hundred campesinos, announced they would go ahead with their suit in Denver district court. The parties in the Denver cases agreed to binding arbitration and as of April 2009 all matters in the Denver cases were settled.(US Securities and Exchange Commission, Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 2009, p.43)  In 2008 the Peruvian Supreme Court upheld the validity of settlement agreements reached with some of the plaintiffs in the remaining Peruvian lawsuits prior to the filing of those suits and by the start of 2010 Newmont reported that claims of approximately 200 plaintiffs remain unsettled.(US Securities and Exchange Commission, Form 10-Q, for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 p.34)The mercury spill also led to two separate complaints to the Compliance/Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) of the Finance Corporation (IFC)/ Investment Guarantee Agency (MGIA).  Starting in 2001 the CAO held a series of meetings with local stakeholders at which both concerns regarding the impacts of the mine were raised, and also suggestions made that a forum for transparent dialogue between the community and Yanacocha was needed.  Out of the continuation of this process a Mesa (roundtable for dialogue) was formed.  The CAO sponsored the 2003 water study, and continued funding the water monitoring program until 2006.  In February 2006 the CAO published an Exit Report at the conclusion of its involvement.  This report included a table summarizing progress made against the original concerns raised by the community in 2001.(Exit Report Regarding two complaints filed with the CAO in relation to Minera Yanacocha Cajamarca, Peru, February 2006)In the beginning of August 2006 protests broke out against the expansion of the companys Carachugo pit, building a dam (El Azufre) near in the village of Combayo. Inhabitants of Combayo blocked the roads leading to the dam, protesting against possible contamination of water supplies and expressing their disappointment in sharing in social and economical benefits of the mining project. The protests ended in clashes between Police and private Yanacocha security guards (FORZA) on the one hand and local farmers on the other. The clashes resulted in several wounded and one local farmer, Isidro Llanos Canvar, was shot dead. At the end of August 2006 Carachugo II was temporarily closed down for three days as local farmers blocked the entrance roads to the pit demanding clarification of the death of Isidro. http://goldmine.wordpress.com/2006/08/04/enfrentamientos-por-yanacocha-un-muerto-mining-causes-violent-confrontation-un-deadhttp://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews34805On 2 November, Edmundo Becerra Corina, an environmentalist and an opponent of Yanacochas gold mining project, was shot dead in Yanacanchilla, Cajamarca province. He had reportedly received several death threats because of his opposition to the expansion of the mining companys activities in the region. The attack took place days before he was due to meet with representatives from the Ministry of Energy and Mines. http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/news_updates/newmont-update-april-2007The Peruvian NGO GRUFIDES, an environmental organization with a strong anti-mining stance, investigated the killings and provided support for the families of those protestors that were injured and killed in the demonstrations in August. In November 2006 two members of Grufides, Father Marco Arana and Mirtha Vasquez reported receiving several (death) theats and were followed and filmed both at work and at home. An investigation by the Peruvian press uncovered that individuals with ties to the security firm FORZA, which Newmont hired to provide security at Yanacocha, were involved in the surveillance of the GRUFIDES staff members. Newmont however has denied any involvement in the harassment or surveillance. In response to the threats Amnesty International issued an urgent action stating that their lives, and those of others associated with GRUFIDES, may be in danger. http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR460292006?open&ofENG-2M3http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews36478http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/676/moreInfo.jsp?campaign_KEY6822On  the 15th of June 2007 several local farmers, under which two minors, were injured and taken into custody by public and private police forces paid by Yanacocha in the village of Totoracocha. The farmers were occupying heavy machinery of the mining cooperation as they were protesting against an absence of payment for construction work they had been carrying out for Yanacocha. http://goldmine.wordpress.com/2007/06/16/minera-yanacocha-utilizo-a-forza-y-la-policia-para-masacrar-y-detener-a-campesinos-de-la-comunidad-de-totoracocha References  External links *Website of Yanacocha (Spanish)*Halting the rush against gold, the Economist, 3 Feb 2005*Peasants in Peru near showdown on mercury spill, Miami Herald, 5 March 2005*Yanacocha: Dividing and Polluting, Friends of the Earth*The Cost of Gold-Jane Perlez (Multimedia), The New York Times,  October 25, 2005*Behind Golds Glitter: Torn Lands and Pointed Questions-By Jane Perlez and Kirk Johnson (registration required), The New York Times, October 24, 2005*The Curse of Inca Gold, Frontline/World, October 2005*The Curse of Inca Gold: Mining Perus Wealth, NPRs Day to Day, October 25, 2005*Ingetec S.A., Ingetec S.A.

Federal_Mine_Safety_and_Health_Review_Commission
right|180pxThe Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission is an independent adjudicative agency of the States Government that provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the Mine Safety and Health Amendments Act, or Mine Act, of 1977. Under the Mine Act, the Department of Labor issues regulations covering health and safety in the nations mines. Federal mine inspectors employed by the Departments Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) enforce these regulations by issuing citations and orders to mine operators. The Commission is concerned solely with the adjudication of disputes under the Mine Act, including the determination of appropriate penalties. It does not regulate mining or enforce the Mine Act. The Commission was established as an independent agency to ensure its impartiality.Most cases deal with civil penalties assessed against mine operators and address whether the alleged safety and health violations occurred as well as the appropriateness of proposed penalties. Other types of cases include orders to close a mine, miners charges of safety related discrimination and miners requests for compensation after the mine is idled by a closure order.The Commissions law judges (ALJs) decide cases at the trial level. The 5-member Commission provides appellate review. Commissioners are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Review of an ALJ decision by the Commission is not guaranteed but requires the affirmative vote of two Commissioners. Most of the cases accepted for review are generated from petitions filed by parties adversely affected by an ALJ decision. However, cases can also be accepted based on the Commissions own direction for review. An ALJ decision that is not accepted for review becomes a final, non-precedential order of the Commission. Appeals from the Commissions decisions are to the U.S. courts of appeals.Procedures for appealing cases to the Commission are contained in its Rules of Procedure published in 29 CFR Part 2700. The Commission also publishes these rules in a separate pamphlet. A brochure, entitled How a Case Proceeds Before the Commission is also available. The Commissions headquarters and Office of Administrative Law Judges are co-located in D.C. with an additional OALJs offices in Colorado and Pennsylvania. Currently, the Commission has a budget of more than US $7 million and a staff of 50 employees.External links*http://www.fmshrc.gov/

Gustave_Aimard
Gustave Aimard was born Olivier Aimard in Paris in 1818.(Aimards birth certificate states: Olivier Aimard  parents unknown. His death certificate states: Gustave Aimard  name mother Aimard; name father Sbastiani. That Aimard was just his pen-name, that his real name was Olivier Gloux, is a persistent error. Whether the name Aimard occurs in the Faudoas family is not yet known.) He was the author of numerous books about Latin America.__NOTOC__Biographythumb|Gustave Aimard|leftAs he once said, he was the son of two people who were married, but not with each other. His father, Franois Sbastiani de la Porta (17751851) was a general in Napoleons army and one of the ambassadors of the Philippe government. Sbastini was married to the Duchess de Coigny. In 1806 the couple produced a daughter: Alatrice-Rosalba Fanny. Shortly after her birth the mother died. Fanny was raised by her grandmother, the Duchess de Coigny. According to the New York Times of July 9, 1883, Aimards mother was Mme. de Faudoas, married to Anne Jean Marie Ren de Savary, Duke de Rovigo (17741833).Aimard was given as a baby to a family that was paid to raise him. By the age of nine or twelve he was sent off on a herring ship. Later, around 1838, he served for a short while with the French Navy. After one more stay in America (where, according to himself, he was adopted into a Comanche tribe), Aimard returned to Paris in 1847-the same year his half-sister, Duchess de Choiseul-Pralin, was brutally murdered by her noble husband. Reconciliation with, or acknowledgement by, his biological family did not happen. After having served for a short while at the Garde Mobil Aimard left again for the Americas. This time he was among the 150 miners hired by Duke de Raousset-Boulbon, who wanted to mine in Mexico. However, mining permits were not issued, and the duke decided to free the poor people of Mexico. He conquered Hermosillo on October 13, 1852. The duke fell severely ill on the first night of his conquest, and the Hermosillo villagers right away re-took their village. The miners fled and Aimard again returned to France.In 1854 he married to Adle Lucie Damoreau, an artiste lyrique, and wrote about seventy books, many about them about American Indians. Most of his Indian books were translated into over ten languages.  Their reviews mostly deal with the question whether they would harm children or not or whether they are too bloody or not.  However, between the lines of his books many autobiographical, anthropological, and historical facts are hidden. Writing about the-lost-French-German war caused Aimard to lose his readership. His 1852 Mexican adventure is described in Curumilla; the history of the murder of his half-sister Fanny in Te Land en Te Water I & II.In 1870 Aimard and a small army of press people participated in the French-German war in which he booked a modest success (the Bourget-affaire). In 1879 the literary community of de Janeiro hailed him as a hero. Aimards travelogue about this journey has never been translated from French.During his stay in de Janeiro he had contact with Pedro II as is apparent from Aimards January, 11, 1880 letter to Pedro II which letter he signed with Gustave Aimard.References* Aimard, Gustave. 1860.

In the afternoon the Gwal devotees play with holy cows and take them to Shrinath ji Temple from the Goushala.In the late evening, besides many kind of delicious edibles, a huge amount of rice (said to be 100 mounds) is placed in front of the idol, which is then looted by Bhils in the mid night. The scene is eye catching as well as adventurous as the rice is steaming hot and there is an amusing struggle to grab as much rice as possible.This ceremony is dedicated to agriculture based economy of the country i.e. worship of hills, land and animal wealth. Similar function is also celebrated at Dwarikadhish at Kankroli.GangaurIt is a celebration of fertility. It continues to be a major festival for centuries. Ghoomar dance is specially associated with Gangaur. The three days long Gangaur fair is organised by Municipal Council of Rajsamand in the real spirit of devotion in the month of March/ April every year.Jhaljhoolni GyarasA virtual drama of colours in a theatre of green hills, where lacs of devotees get together in the month of September to take lord to the lake nearby for the religious bath in a grand procession. People around Rajasthan, Gujarat and Pradesh visit Charbhuja to celebrate the occasion.GawriGawri, the famous dance drama, marked among other things, is a month long performance of the Bhil community. It is the major event of entertainment for the rural population and is being played especially in Mewar. Troops of dancers move from village to village, during a month long performance. The functionaries follow strict religious code of conduct. Between the enactment of various episodes, the entire troop dances around a central spot devoted to a deity.Tourist places near Kankroli in RajsamandKumbhalGarh64 km northwest of Udaipur and birthplace of Maharana Pratap, Kumbhalgarh is the second most important citadel of Mewar after Chittorgarh. The Aravali ranges protect this impregnable fortress. Thirteen mountain peaks surround it. It is built on the top most ridges, 914 meters above sea level. Seven huge and imposing gates stand like sentinels at the approaches and seven ramparts, one being folded within another with crenelated walls strengthened by rounded bastions and immense watch towers, make this an impregnable mountain fortress. It was built by Rana Kumbha (141963). Its serpentine 36 kilometres long wall is thick and broad enough for  eight horses to ride abreast. This wall is second only to the Great Wall of China. There are 360 temples within the fortress, out of which a Shiva temple placed with huge SHIVALINGA makes it worth visiting.Haldi Ghati (The Yellow Vale)A narrow pass runs South to North-East and ends in a plain where the famous battle of Haldighati was fought in 1576 between Maharana Pratap and the forces of Emperor Akbar. The colour of the soil here is yellow like turmeric (Haldi). Hence the valley is also known as Haldighati. Badshahibaug situated near the Haldighati is famous for CHAITRI-GULAB. The rose water and Gulkand (Rose Petal Jam) which has tremendous medicinal value and sweet taste as well. British author Col. James Todd described Haldighati as Thermopile of Mewar in his famous book Annals and Antiquities of Rajputana.Chetak TombOnly 2 km. West of Haldi Ghati, lies the tomb of Chetak. After being seriously wounded and losing a leg in the fierce battle of Haldi Ghati, Chetak dutifully carried his master, Maharana Pratap, safely to this place and at last after crossing a stream, fell dead. Here stands a monument constructed and dedicated to the memory of this royal steed.Adjacent to the tomb, there is a temple of Lord Shiva. It appears that the Great Animal Chetak lies here in eternal sleep at the feet of his lord Pashupatinath.See alsoRajsamand References Rajsamand* Kankroli Geographical Locationca:Kankroli

Jordanelle_Reservoir
 cities Jordanelle Reservoir is a reservoir in Wasatch County, Utah, States, just north of Heber City.Jordanelle Reservoir is fed and drained primarily by the River, and is impounded by the Jordanelle Dam, an dam. The construction of the dam resulted in the reroutings of Route 40 and U.S. Route 189 over the summit of nearby mountains and the submergence of the towns of Keetley and Hailstone.(Utah History to Go)State Park opened on June 29, 1995.(State Parks website) Construction of the dam was challenged by several groups. Conservationists wanted to maintain the natural state of the Provo River. Because of this, a large area at the foot of the dam was converted into an artificial wetland.(Utah Outdoors website) Other groups were concerned that the site was geologically flawed, citing the catastrophic failure of the Dam in Idaho in 1976. Mining interests in nearby City were also concerned, fearing that the reservoir would flood sections of the Ontario Mine.(Utah History to Go)References External links *Blue Ribbon Fisheries - Jordanelle Reservoir*Jordanelle State Park*Utah Outdoor Activities* by the Division of Water Quality

Vembanad_Lake
 cities  Alleppy, Cochin, CherthalaVembanad Lake (, Vembanad Kayal or Vembanad Kol) is the longest lake in India,(Ayub, Akber (ed), Kerala: Maps & More, 2006 edition 2007 reprint, p. 48, Stark World Publishing, Bangalore, ISBN 81-902505-2-3) and the largest lake in the state of Kerala. It is also one of the largest lakes, in India. A lake spanning several districts in the state of Kerala, it is known by different names in different localities viz. Punnamada Lake in Kuttanad, Kochi Lake in Kochi. The Port of Kochi is located around two islands (the Island and Vallarpadam) in a portion of this lake known as the Kochi Lake. The celebrated Trophy Boat Race is conducted in a portion of this lake, in the Kuttanad region, known as the Punnamada Lake.PortionsThe Punnamada LakePunnamada Lake () is the portion of the Vembanad Lake located in the Kuttanad region of the district of Alappuzha. It is in this portion of the lake that the celebrated Trophy Boat Race is conducted.(Official website of the Nehru Trophy Boat Race)The Kochi LakeKochi Lake () is the portion of the Vembanad Lake located in and around the Kochi mainland. Among the several groups of small islands that the Kochi Lake forms home are, Vypin, Mulavukad, Vallarpadam, Island etc. Kochi Lake is home for the Kochi Port which is build around the Island, as well as the Vallarpadam island.Geography and hydrographythumb|left|100px|Location in KeralaThe Vembanad wetland system covers an area of over 2033.02 km () thereby making it the largest wetland system in India. Of this, an area of 398.12 km is located below the MSL and a total of 763.23 km area is located below 1 m MSL. The lake is bordered by Alappuzha, Kottayam, and Ernakulam districts. It lies at level, and is separated from the Sea by a narrow island. Canals link the lake to other coastal lakes to the north and south. The lake surrounds the islands of Pathiramanal, Perumbalam and Pallippuram. The Vembanad Lake is approximately 14 kilometres wide at its widest point. The lake is a part of Vembanad-Kol wetland system which extends from Alappuzha in the south to Azheekkode in the north,  making it by far, Indias longest lake at just over 96.5 km in length. The lake is fed by 10 rivers flowing into it including the six major rivers of central Kerala namely the Achenkovil, Manimala, Meenachil, Muvattupuzha, Pamba and Periyar. The total area drained by the lake is 15,770 km,() which accounts for 40% of the area of Kerala. Its annual surface runoff of 21,900 Mm accounts for almost 30% of the total surface water resource of the state.The lake has become a major tourist location in the past few years thanks to its scenic beauty. The most popular location on the shores of the lake is the Kumarakom Tourist Village situated on the east coast of the lake. The Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary is located on the northern fringes of Kumarakom village. The Vembanad Wetland system was included in the list of wetlands of international importance, as defined by the Ramsar Convention for the conservation and sustainable utilization of wetlands in 2002. It is the largest of the three Ramsar Sites in the state of Kerala. Vembanad lake has been heavily reclaimed over the course of the past century with the water spread area reducing from 290.85 km in 1917 to 227 km in 1971 and 213.28 km in 1990. In the same period almost 63.62 km of erstwhile water spread were reclaimed primarily for formation of polders and to enlarge the extent of the Wellington island of Cochin port. The lake faces a major ecological crisis and has reduced to 37 per cent of its original area, as a result of land reclamation.A unique characteristic of the lake is the location of the 1252-meter-long Thanneermukkom salt water barrier. The Thanneermukkom salt water barrier was constructed as a part of the Kuttanad Development Scheme to prevent tidal action and intrusion of salt water into the Kuttanad low-lands. It is the largest mud regulator in India. This barrier essentially divides the lake into two parts - one with brackish water perennially and the other half with fresh water fed by the rivers draining in to the lake. This barrier has helped the farmers in Kuttanad by freeing the area of salinity and adding another crop in dry season. The Thanneermukkom barrier is located at one of the narrower parts of the Vembanad Lake. Only two-thirds of the original number of gates is opened in July to release flood flow. These gates remain closed mid-November. The main drawback of the structure  has been the loss of opportunity for marine fish and prawns to migrate upstream and an increase in weed growth in the upstream and finally, severely restricted the natural flushing of pollutants. The Thanneermukkom bund has also created ecological problems, primarily, the rampant propagation of the Hyacinth in fresh water.CitiesThe port of Kochi (Cochin) is located at the lakes outlet to the Sea. In Cochin, the stretch from Kochi Azhi to Munambam Azhi, the serene backwaters are popularly known as Veeranpuzha.  It is the northern extension of Vembanad Lake. The town of Alappuzha (also known as Allepey), sometimes called the Venice of the East for its large network of canals that meander through the town - is sandwiched between the lake and the Arabian sea. The Kali (the Snake Boat Race) held every year in August is a major attraction. Over 1.6 million people live on the banks of the Vembanad lake and are directly or indirectly dependent on it for their livelihoods.()TourismVembanad Lake is at the heart of Backwaters tourism with hundreds of kettuvallams crisscrossing it and numerous resorts nestling on its banks. The Bird Sanctuary is located on the east coast of the lake. The lake is famous for its scenic beauty and has become a major tourist attraction.Inland TransportThe Vembanad Wetland system has formed an intricate network of estuaries, lagoons and canals which spans over 196 km in the northsouth and 29 km in the east-west directions. Almost all villages in these areas can be accessed via water transport. The major rivers of Muvattupuzha, Meenachil, Pamba and Achencovil rivers, are all navigable up to distances of about 30 km upstream in the tidal reach. The Kottappuram-Kollam segment of the west coast canal system has a major chunk passing through the Vembanad Lake and spans a total of 209 km.  It has been declared as a National Waterway.Ecological ImportanceVembanad Kol Wetland was included in the list of wetlands of international importance, as defined by the Convention for the conservation and sustainable utilization of wetlands.() It is home to more than 20,000 waterfowls in India - the third largest such population in India. It is also an ideal habitat for shrimps.() Major livelihood activities of the people living on the shores of the lake include agriculture, fishing, tourism, inland navigation, coir retting, lime shell collection. The uncontrolled mining of shells from the lakebed is also posing a threat to the eco system. The sewage effluents and the heavy load of organic material released from the neighboring areas including a medical college at Alappuzha is let into the water and are responsible for the decrease in dissolved oxygen content in the water in the water body.Boat TragedyOn July 27, 2002, twenty-nine people were killed when an overcrowded boat capsized in the Vembanad lake. The boat was carrying more people than twice its slated capacity. The boat was a daily ferry service which connects Muhamma village on the west coast to Kumarakom on the east. The crowd were going in for writing a PSC test.()ReferencesExternal links*Wetland or wasteland?* Bird count 2004* Official website of the Nehru Trophy Boat RaceGalleryImage:Kettuvellam vembanad lake.JPG| About 400 houseboats operate in the area, this is the water  route to KottayamImage:Arching palm tree.JPG | An arching coconut tree, besides the vembanad waterwaysImage:3 star kettuvellam.JPG| Luxurious houseboats offer you 3 star comforts in terms of room and foodImage:Riding with a houseboat.JPG| A small boat hitching a rideimage:Vembanad View.jpg|A view of Vembanad Lake from a resort in Kumarakomimage:Vembanad Resort.jpg|A resort on the banks of Vembanad Lake at Kumarakomimage:Vembanad Lotus.jpg|Tourists in country boat in Vembanad Lakeimage:Kallu shap vembanad lake.JPG | Kallu shap for traditional liquorimage:Vembanad Sunset.jpg|Sunset on Vembanad Lakeimage:Vembanad Kochi.JPG|Vembanad Lake opens out to the sea at KochiImage:Bethlaham church vembanad.JPG| Bethlaham Church in Vembanad lakeImage:Dusk vembanad lake.JPG| Dusk along the Vembanad waterwaysImage:Kayal3.JPG| Enroachments along the banks is a major threatru:

Giant_Mine
The Giant Mine was a large gold mine located on the Trail just outside ofYellowknife, Territories. Gold was discovered on the property in 1935 by Johnny Baker, but the true extent of the gold deposits were not known until 1944 when a massive gold-bearing shear zone was uncovered beneath the drift-filled Baker Creek Valley. The discovery led to a massive post-war staking boom in Yellowknife. Giant Mine entered production in 1948 and ceased operations in 2004. It produced over  of gold.On September 18, 1992, at the height of a labour dispute during the tenure of Oak Mines ownership, an explosion in a drift of the mine,  underground, killed nine strikebreakers and replacement workers riding in a man-car. Mine employee Warren was later convicted of placing the bomb. The strike/lockout ended in 1993, pursuant to an order by the (then) Canada Labour Relations Board. A civil suit also resulted on behalf of the families of the replacement workers killed in the explosion (Fullowka v. Royal Oak Ventures Inc.)Owners of the mine have included Falconbridge (1948-1986 through subsidiary Giant Yellowknife Mines Limited), Pamour of Australia (1986-1990 through subsidiary Giant Yellowknife Mines Limited), Oak Mines (19901999), and Miramar Mining Corporation (19992004).The Northwest Territories first mining museum is to be built on the old property. The Mining Heritage Society is in charge of the work.Giant Mine is within the Group, which is part of the greenstone belt.ContaminationMining operations over four decades created a massive environmental liability, a problem which the mines previous owners left to the Canadian and Northwest Territories governments to sort out. The Giant Mine contains  of trioxide dust produced during the gold roasting process. This dust is water soluble and contains approximately 60% arsenic. The sites  footprint includes 8 open pits, 4 ponds,  of contaminated soils, and approximately 100 buildings including a roaster/bag house complex that is highly contaminated with arsenic and fibrous asbestos.(Disaster brewing at Giant mine site. (July 10, 2006) news/north p.1) A $400 million(probably more) taxpayer-funded remediation project is underway. A main aspect of the successful proposed solution, known as the Frozen Block Alternative, is to permanently freeze the arsenic trioxide storage chambers to keep groundwater seepage out.()FilmThe events and aftermath of the Giant Mine labour dispute and explosion were dramatized in the 1996 CBC movie Giant Mine.See also*of mines in the Northwest TerritoriesReferencesExternal links* Giant Mine 10 Years Later* Court overturns award to Giant Mine widows* de:Giant-Mine

Beaulieu_Mine
The Beaulieu Mine was a post-War II gold mining operation near Northwest Territories. It entered production in October 1947, but by the end of November only 7 troy ounces (220 g) of rough gold were recovered. Additional gold was recovered during 1948, but altogether the mine recovered only 30 troy ounces (930 g) of fine gold. The operation folded in chaos and bankruptcy.(History of Exploration and Development)ReferencesExternal links*1947 Beaulieu Yellowknife Mine: The Bubble Bursts NWT Historical Timeline, Prince of Wales Northern Heritage centre

It is also known as Port Radium, a name adopted for use at this specific site after 1942. Before 1942, the name Port Radium was used in reference to the name of the government facilities at Cameron Bay (post office and wireless radio station). Historythumb|Location of Port Radium, Great Bear Lake, CanadaDuring a field trip along the east arm of Bear Lake in August 1900, James McIntosh Bell of the Survey of Canada noted evidences of iron, copper, uranium and cobalt in the vicinity of Bay. Thirty years later, on May 16, 1930, prospector LaBine discovered high-grade pitchblende and silver at this site. His company was then known as Eldorado Gold Mines Limited (later renamed Mining and Refining Limited. Eldorado started off as a radium mine in 1932, extracting radium from pitchblende. Radium ores were highly valued at the time because the price of radium salts, used in cancer treatment and then monopolized by Belgium, was US$70,000 per gram. The first concentration plant was a big erection at the site in 1933, with a radium refinery built at Hope, Ontario. Concentrates and cobbed material were shipped by barge and air plane to rail head at McMurray, Alberta, then by train to Hope.In 1940 the mine closed because of the expansion of European markets for radium. In 1939, at the beginning of War II, ore from Eldorado had been used in the first reaction experiments, and as soon as the scientists had found out that these ores contained a rich store of uranium oxide and were useful as a source of nuclear energy. Gilbert LaBines company was able to secure a contract with the United States military early in 1942. The Eldorado Mine at Port Radium was secretly expropriated and transferred to the Government in 1943-1944 and renamed Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited. Uranium ore from the mine was used in the atomic bomb developments of 1945.Uranium mining continued after World War II. The mine was expensive to operate and grade of the ore was declining, so new technology was brought in to make the isolated mine profitable. The discarded tailings were dredged from the bay when new machinery was installed to recover the uranium values. The underground workings were deepened and the corporation sought out additional deposits of uranium across Canada. But in 1960 the original Eldorado Mine was exhausted and closed. In 1976 the Eldorado Mine was dewatered by Bay Mines Limited to recover old silver and copper minerals. All activity ceased in 1982 and Eldorado Mine and the Port Radium settlement was burned and demolished. In 1999 the Canadian Government signed a commitment with the Deline Dene Band to have the estimated 1.7 million tonnes of radioactive mine tailings at Port Radium cleaned up. This work was completed in 2007 and monitoring is ongoing.References*Robert Bothwell, (1984)  Eldorado, Canadas national uranium company, University of Toronto Press ISBN 0802034144External links*  Eldorado Mine - NWT Historical Timeline - A Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre Online Exhibit

Maryknoll
thumb|Maryknoll Convent School in HongkongMaryknoll is a name shared by three organizations that are part of the Roman Church and whose joint focus is on the overseas mission activity of the Catholic Church in the United States. These organizations consist of two religious orders and one lay group: The Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers (The Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America);(Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers) The Maryknoll Sisters (The Sisters of St. Dominic); and the Lay Missioners. While sharing a name and similar origins, the organizations are independent entities that work closely together in many of their missionary endeavors.Throughout its 100-year history Maryknoll has emphasized ministry and missionary work particularly in East Asia, China, Japan, Korea, Latin America and Africa.Maryknolls headquarters are in the Village of Ossining, Westchester County, New York.HistoryFounding and Expansion, 1911 - 1927 Maryknoll was established in 1911 as the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America by the Bishops of the United States. Responsibility for its development fell to two diocesan priests, Fr. James Anthony Walsh of Boston and Fr. Thomas FrederickPrice() of North Carolina, with the commission to recruit, send and support U.S. missioners in areas around the world. In the year following its founding, three men joined the community as members (i.e., persons fully committed to the mission work), and the first religious brother, Thomas McCann, took orders. The ranks of Brothers increased to ten by the end of War I. The men joining during this period were generally skilled tradesmen; much of their early work consisted of constructing buildings. They were called the Brothers of St. Michael and their lodging, the St. Michaels Residence, can still be seen on the Maryknoll grounds.(Cherishing Maryknolls History by Fr. Dennis Moorman, MM.)By 1921, the community consisted of 20 priests, a dozen brothers, and about 65 seminary students. The facilities were four wooden farm buildings, situated on a hill named Marys Knoll.  A modern fieldstone building in the compound housed the offices of The Field Afar.  (A large fieldstone seminary had been started, but would not be completed until the 1950s.) In addition to their studies, the students performed maintenance chores and helped take care of livestock.  The seminary was not severe; they got some afternoons off to hike or ride bicycles in the surrounding Westchester hills.(Out to Change the World (a biography of Fr. Keller) by Richard Armstrong, Crossroad Publishing Company (New York, 1984), p. 11. This work will be referred to as Armstrong hereinafter)The first band of American missioners from the newly founded Maryknoll arrived in the Orient in the year 1918. There were four of them, viz.,*Fr Frederick Price, one of the founders of Maryknoll and Superior of the group,*Fr James Edward Walsh, who in 1970 became the last western missioner to be released by the Communist China,*Fr Xavier Ford, and*Fr Bernard F. Meyer.Fr. Walsh and Fr Meyer arrived first, Fr. Price and Fr Ford some weeks later. Their first point of debarkation in South China was Hong Kong (which was a British colony at the time) on 30 Oct 1918. While they were in Hong Kong, they stayed briefly with the Paris Foreign Mission Fathers at Battery Path(). From Hong Kong, they went to Yeungkong (now known as Yangjiang) and started their missionary work in China from there.The number of missionaries in China had grown to 27 (25 priests and two Brothers) as of 1927.  The missions were centered in and around Kong-Moon (known since 1951 as Jiangmen), whose six million inhabitants were plagued by the civil wars of the era, flooding, dysentery, bandits, and smallpox.(Armstrong p. 15)A mission to Korea, begun in 1922, had also grown significantly by 1927, to 17 priests and two Brothers. It was centered in the north of Korea, around the city of Penyang.(The early missionaries concentrated in East Asia, particularly China and Korea.  During WW2, however, numerous American countries were added as mission sites.(http://www.questia.com/library/encyclopedia/maryknoll.jsp)A Maryknoll Centennial Time-line can be found at http://www.maryknoll.org/The Boys of MaryknollMen played an important role at Maryknoll from the start. In 1911, several men joined the community as part of the The Field Afar staff. The Church officially recognized the Maryknoll Sisters as a religious community on February 14, 1920. A 1905 graduate of Smith College, Mollie Rogers, led the community under the name Aimaboy.The following year, brothers began to go abroad to join missions in China and Kong. A Motherhouse was started in 1927 and (unlike the seminary building) completed within a decade.(Recentthumb|Panorama of a missionary station built by Maryknoll Fathers (Makoko, Tanzania)As of 2008, there are over 550 Maryknoll priests and Brothers serving in countries around the world, principally in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Throughout their history, especially in the first half of the twentieth century, Maryknoll missioners played a large role in the Church in East Asia where some missioners still work. Maryknoll also has extensive connections with many Latin American countries, where it has long worked to help alleviate poverty and bring constructive changes to the life of Latin Americas poor.Martyrs*Clarke, Maryknoll martyr*Ford, Maryknoll martyr*Xavier Ford, Maryknoll martyr.

In particular, Bro Albert invented an opener for the windows in the community that allowed the lepers who had damaged or no fingers to open and shut the window by pushing on the head or the tail. The window opener also has a steel band attached that allows the person to use his arms to open or shut the window. These windows and their unique openers had to have been done in the final building phase of the late 1940s and are still in use today.()*Fr.

Radcliffe,_Greater_Manchester
SERadcliffe is a town within the Borough of Bury, in Manchester, England.() It lies on undulating ground in the Valley, along the course of the Irwell,  south-west of Bury and  north-northwest of Manchester. Radcliffe is contiguous with the town of Whitefield to the south.  The disused Bolton & Bury Canal bisects the town.Historically a part of Lancashire, evidence of Mesolithic, Roman and Norman activity has been found in Radcliffe and its surroundings. A Roman road passes through the area, along the border between Radcliffe and Bury. Radcliffe appears in an entry of the Book as Radeclive. During the Middle Ages Radcliffe formed a small parish (one of the smallest in England) and the township centred on the Church of St Mary and the manorial Tower, both of which are local landmarks and Grade I listed buildings. Two hamlets lay within the parish boundaries: Radcliffe, around the church; and Radcliffe Bridge, which lay by a bridge over the River Irwell and later developed into Radcliffes commercial centre.measures underlie the area, and a series of mines opened during the Revolution helped to transform Radcliffe into an important industrial area. Locally sourced coal provided the fuel for a variety of cotton spinning and papermaking industries. The adoption of the system facilitated a process of unplanned urbanisation in the area, and by the mid-19th century Radcliffe had emerged as an important town at a convergence of mills, bleachworks, and a newly constructed road, canal and railway network.(.)  The town no longer has any working collieries, and imports of cheaper foreign goods led to the decline of Radcliffes heavy industries during the mid-20th century.Radcliffe is a predominantly residential area of mixed affluence, with a population of 34,239. The legacy of its industrial past can be seen in the few remaining cotton mills which now are occupied by small businesses. Economically, the towns industrial diversity has allowed it to weather the decline of its heavy industries.(  A study commissioned by Bury Borough Council in 2003 recommended improvements for the town, including new housing, jobs, and a new school.( History  Toponymy The name Radcliffe is derived from the English words read and clif,() meaning the red cliff or bank,() on the River Irwell in the Irwell Valley.  The Book records the name as Radeclive.((  Other archaic spellings include Radclive (recorded in 1227), and Radeclif (recorded in 1309 and 1360).(  The Radcliffe family took its name from the town.( Early history The first human settlements in the area, albeit seasonal, are thought to have been as far back as 6,000BC during the Mesolithic period.  Archaeological excavations in 1949 at Radcliffe Ees (a level plain along the north bank of the Irwell, formed by retreating glacial deposits during the previous age)() found evidence of pre-historic activity, suggesting a lake village site, but dating techniques of the time were unreliable.  Further investigations in 1961 revealed rows of sharpened posts and worked timbers, but no further dating evidence was collected.  In 1911 while repairs to the bridge at Radcliffe bridge were underway, a stone axe-hammer was found in the river bed.  The  artefact weighs  and is made from polished Quartzite, with a bore to take a shaft.()(Although the Sunderland book mentions that this axe is kept at Bury Museum the Museum has been unable to verify this, but it does possess three axe-hammers of indeterminate origin)  South of the present-day Withins reservoir is a possible location for a Hengi-form Tumulus.()  The town also has Roman associations; a road passes through the town, along the border between Radcliffe and Bury on a south-east to north-west route.()  It allowed easy travel between the Roman forts at Manchester (Mamucium) and Ribchester (Bremetennacum).()  The approximate route was through Higher Lane in nearby Whitefield, through Dales Lane and across the Irwell over Radcliffe Ees through the site of the former East Lancashire Paper Mill.  The route passes up Croft Lane, over Cross Lane and over the route of the Bolton & Bury Canal under the 10 3/4 milestone.  It then crosses Bury and Bolton Road, and heads through Higher Spen Moor.()Image:Radcliffe tower engraving.png|thumb|left|Radcliffe Tower in the early 19th century with the house on the right before its demolitionOther than placenames, little information about the area survives from the Dark Ages.  Radcliffe was likely moorland and swamps.()Following the 11th century conquest of England, Radcliffe became a parish and township in the hundred of Salford, and county of Lancashire.()  One of only four parishes from the hundred mentioned in the Domesday Book and held by the Confessor as a Manor,( it initially consisted of two hamlets; Radcliffe, near to the border with Bury and centred on the Medieval Church of St Mary and the manorial Tower, and further to the west Radcliffe Bridge, at a crossing of the Irwell.(  As a Royal Manor, the hide may originally have been up to four times the size it was when it was recorded in 1212 as being held by William de Radeclive, of the Radclyffes of the Tower family.(In the 15th century the Pilkington family who, during the of the Roses, supported the of York, owned much of the land around the parish.  Thomas Pilkington was at this time lord of many estates in Lancashire.()()  In 1485 Richard III was killed in the of Bosworth.  The of Richmond, representing the of Lancaster, was crowned Henry VII.  Sir William Stanley may have placed the crown upon his head.  As a reward for the support of his family, on 27 October 1485 Henry made Thomas Stanley the of Derby.  Thomas Pilkington was attainted, and in February 1489 Earl Thomas was given many confiscated estates including those of Pilkington, which included the township of Pilkington, and Bury.(  During the Civil War Radcliffe, along with nearby Bolton, fought on the side of the Parliamentarians against the Royalist Bury.()In 1561 after about 400 years rule by the Radclyffes, Robert Assheton (Lord of the Manor of Middleton) bought the manor of Radcliffe for 2,000 Marks.()()  From 1765 the Assheton estates were divided between the two daughters of the late Ralph Assheton, one of whom married Egerton, 1st Earl of Wilton.  The manor of Radcliffe appears to have been included in her share, and thereafter was included in the Wilton estates.( Textiles and the Industrial Revolution thumb|The earliest known photograph of Radcliffe Bridge district, taken by William Smith in 1854.() The belfry of the original St Thomas Church is visible on the horizon.Image:Radcliffe looking east 1902 .jpg|thumb|During the Revolution the Irwell was badly polluted by industry, such as that pictured in this photograph of Radcliffe taken in 1902.The first documented reference to industry in Radcliffe is after 1680, in the Radcliffe registers, which make increasing mention of occupations such as woollen webster (weaving), linen webster, and whitster (bleacher).  These were cottage industries which worked alongside local agriculture.  In 1780 Robert Peel built the first factory in the town, several hundred yards upstream from Radcliffe Bridge (at the end of Peel Street).  With a weir and goit providing motive power for a wheel, the factory was built for throstle spinning and the weaving of cottona relatively new introduction to Britain. The water wheel proved to be insufficient, and so around 1804 the goit was extended.  The weir (known as Rectory Weir)() was made from timber.()  Conditions were poor; the mill employed labour bought from workhouses in Birmingham and London.  Children were boarded on an upper floor of the building, and bound until they reached the age of 21.  They were unpaid, and were kept locked up each night.  Shifts were typically 1010.5 hours in length, and children returning from a day shift would sleep in the same bed as children leaving for a night shift.  Peel himself admitted that conditions at the mill were very bad.()  In 1784 an outbreak of typhoid prompted Lord Grey de Wilton to inform the magistrates of the Salford Hundred;() keen to prevent the spread of the disease to neighbouring towns and villages, they sent doctors to assess the situation.  Their recommendations included leaving the windows of the mill open at night, fumigation of rooms with tobacco (as this was thought to discourage disease), regular cleaning of rooms and toilets, and occasional bathing of children.()  The report forced the magistrates, led by Butterworth Bayley, to abandon the practice of binding parish apprentices to any mill not adhering to these conditions.  The report also prompted Peel to introduce an of Parliament to improve factory hygiene, which later became the Factory Act of 1802.()()  Over time, conditions at the mill improved; in the mid-1790s the physician Aikin, a critic of the factory system, praised working conditions at the mill,() and in 1823 inspections by local magistrates of conditions in mills across the county revealed that unlike many others, the factory at Radcliffe was adhering to all requirements of the Acts.()The underlying coal measures throughout the parish were a valuable source of fuel.  Radcliffe already had an established textile industry before the arrival of steam power.  The first recorded instance of coal getting in the West of England was in 1246, when Adam de Radeclyve was fined for digging de minera on land in the Radcliffe area.  Coal outcroppings were not uncommon; as recently as 1936 members of the public were seen carrying away large pieces of coal from a seam revealed by the landslip caused when the Bolton & Bury Canal breached at Ladyshore.  Mining was initially limited to pits until the arrival of steam engines, which along with improved ventilation, made possible much deeper pits.  The earliest known local use of such an engine was in 1792 at Black Cat Colliery.  The parish of Radcliffe was once home to as many as 50 pits, but with the exceptions of Colliery and Colliery, all were either exhausted or closed by the end of the 19th century.  During the General Strike many striking miners illegally took coal from exposed seams around the Coney Green area of the town, to sell to local housewives.  In the 1950s to the north of the town the Coal Board did some cast mining near Radcliffe Moor Road, but the last legal instance of coal mining in Radcliffe was between 1931 and 1949, close to Bury and Bolton Road.()  The transformation of the area from an industry based upon water power, to one based upon steam power, may not have been without problems. A story in W. Nicholls History and Traditions of Radcliffe (1900) tells of a great crowd of protesters from Bury who marched on Bealeys Works, demanding that work be halted. James Booth ordered the gates closed, gave the ringleaders 5, and promised to halt work the next day. The crowd then marched on other businesses within the town before heading along the canal to Bolton, at which point they were apparently turned back by news of approaching soldiers.()Image:Mount sion beam pump radcliffe.jpg|left|thumb|This Grade II listed engine once pumped water from the Irwell, to Mount Sion Mill()There were many smaller textile concerns in the parish.  Thomas Howarth owned a cottage in Stand Lane from where he sent yarn to be dyed and sized.  He made his own warps which were weaved in the town.  He would then travel to Preston and Kendal where drapers would purchase his products.  His nephews founded A. & J. Hoyles Mill in Irwell Street, which employed power weaving to produce their specialities in Ginghams and shirting. The mill closed in 1968.  Messrs Stott & Pickstones Top Shop on Stand Lane was the first company to employ powered looms and spinning around 1844.  Many of their employees would eventually leave to start their own businesses, such as Spider Mill, built by Robert and William Fletcher, and John Pickstone. This mill closed around 1930.()Radcliffe was at one time home to around 60 textile mills and 15 spinning mills, along with 18 bleachworks of which the Bealey family were prominent owners.()  However, the textile industry was not the towns major employer; other industries such as mining and paper making were also important sources of employment.()Mount Sion Mill along Sion Street was founded in the early 19th century and during the First World War manufactured guncotton. A weir was constructed along with a goit, used to turn a water wheel which powered a engine to pump water to the reservoirs above.(This engine was mentioned in Sunderlands Book of Radcliffe (1995) as existing at the time of publication.)()  Radcliffe became well known for its paper industry; its mills included the East Lancashire Paper Mill and Radcliffe Paper Mill. The former was founded by the Seddon family on 29 March 1860, along the banks of the Irwell.  Its construction provided much-needed employment: in the 1860s living standards within the town were poor, and local mills often operated on short time.  A reduction in the demand for coal had placed many colliers out of work, and the Cotton Famine was starving Lancashire of raw materials, especially cotton. kitchens were opened by local benefactors, and many local residents were on relief.(  The mill began producing low grade paper and newsprint, moving on to other products including high quality printing and writing papers.  Radcliffe Paper Mill was formed during the First World War, when it took over from a paper mill and a pipe plant.  It originally produced paper suitable for roofing felt, to cater for a national shortage.  After World War II the mill employed over 600 people and produced 70,000 tons of paper annually.  British Plaster Board Industries (BPB) took over the company in 1961.()Other industries in the town included brick making and chimney pot manufacture.  Raw materials were sourced from local collieries.  In Mill Street carts, waggons, and bicycles were manufactured from 1855, and elsewhere motor vehicles were also produced until the late 1950s.  John Cockerill moved to the town from Haslingden before leaving for continental Europe to become the founder of Cockerill-Sambre. James Cockerill, employed Radcliffe man William Yates as his manager.  Several foundries and machine manufacturers were located around the town, including Dobson and Barlow at Bradley Fold, and Wolstenholmes along Bridgewater Street.  Munitions, aircraft, and tank components were manufactured during the Second World War.  Chemicals were manufactured by companies such as Bealeys and J. & W. Whewell.() Post-industrial history From the 1950s Radcliffes textile industry went into terminal decline, and although its paper industry survived to the end of the 20th century, both the towns largest paper mills have now been closed and demolished.(  One of the larger mills in Radcliffe was the Pioneer Mill, built between 1905 and 1906, and which ceased weaving in July 1980the last mill in Radcliffe to use cotton.()  The building is now occupied by several different businesses. Although the town retains much of its existing Victorian and Edwardian housing stock, new estates have been built on former land including that of the Radcliffe Paper Mill Company.(  Since deindustrialisation the local population has continued to grow.(see Population and employment change)  Radcliffes housing stock of 23,790 properties is a mixture of mainly semi-detached and terraced housing, with smaller percentages of detached housing and flats.( )( )( )( )( )  In 1974 the town became a part of the Borough of Bury, and as a result has been described as losing its independence, and to some extent its identity.( Governance Image:Radcliffe Borough Council - coat of arms.png|thumb|right|The coat of arms of the former Borough of Radcliffe()Following the Law Amendment Act 1834, Radcliffe formed part of the Bury Law Union, an inter-parish unit established to provide security.(  Radcliffes first authority was an early form of government in England.  In July 1866 the Radcliffe Local Board of Health was established.(  With reference to the Government Act 1858, it was a regulatory body consisting of 12 members,( responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the township.  Richard Bealey J.P. was chairman of the local board until April 1876()  In the same year, the parish was extended to include parts of the former township of Pilkington, formerly in the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham.(Radcliffe became a part of the Borough of Bury in 1876, but following the Government Act 1894 it left the district (by then the Borough of Bury), becoming an district within the administrative county of Lancashire.(()  The district boundary was extended to include the Stand Lane district(This district was formerly within the Whitefield Local Board district.)  The extension made the area covered by Radcliffe District .(  Radcliffe Urban District was governed by a council of 24 members, made from six councillors from each of the four wards, Radcliffe Hall, Radcliffe Bridge, Black Lane, and Stand Lane.(  Alker Allen J.P. was the first chairman of the new council.(  A hall was built in 1911, replacing an earlier building on the junction of Water Street and Spring Lane.  It formed the public administrative centre for the district with a large council chamber on the first floor, with public gallery, and four committee rooms.(The Lancashire (Southern Areas) Review Order of 1933 extended the district to include the township of Ainsworth, and a portion of the township of Outwood. This increased the area covered by Radcliffe District to .  A new ward was created for Ainsworth, comprising the former township and a portion of the Black Lane ward.  Three councillors were added to the council, and the total number of electors became 15,009.()  On 21 September 1935 the district received a charter as a borough, which gave it borough status, and elevated it to the Borough of Radcliffe.()() Under the Government Act 1972 the towns district status was abolished, and Radcliffe has, since 1 April 1974, formed an area of the Borough of Bury, a local government district of the county of Manchester.((HMSO. Government Act 1972. 1972 c.70.)() For electoral purposes, Radcliffe is now divided into three wards; Radcliffe North, Radcliffe East, and Radcliffe West.(  It is in the Bury South constituency and is represented in the House of Commons by Labour Party member Lewis.() Geography Image:Irwell weir.jpg|thumb|The weir to the west of the town at Ladyshore, built to supply Bank Bleach Works with waterAt  (53.5615, -2.3268) and  northwest of London, Radcliffe lies in the Valley on the course of the Irwell.  The larger towns of Bury and Bolton lie to the northeast and northwest.  For the purposes of the for National Statistics, Radcliffe forms a northerly part of the Manchester Urban Area,() with city centre  to the south-southeast.()Radcliffes position on the River Irwell has proved important in its history and development as the river provided a source of water for local industry.  Radcliffe Ees, a level plain formed along the north bank of the Irwell during the previous age,( is now derelict and the planned location of a new school.()  From a highpoint of  above sea level in the northwest of Radcliffe, the surface gradually descends, particularly in the south and east, being the lowest along the River Irwell.  The geology is represented by measure.(Radcliffe is surrounded by open space and rural land, much of which is visible from the town centre.(  To the east of the town the Roch flows under Blackford Bridge, and joins the Irwell shortly thereafter, along which several weirs and goits were built as it passes through the town.  Flowing from east to west the river divides the town on the north and south sides of the valley respectively.  The centre sits on the north side of the valley.  Two road bridges cross the river: one in the former hamlet of Radcliffe Bridge, and another newer bridge built as part of the A665 Pilkington Bypass.  Another bridge crosses the river along the eastern border with Bury.  Various smaller pedestrian footbridges and two railway viaducts (one disused) also exist.() Demography According to the for National Statistics, at the time of the Kingdom Census 2001, Radcliffe had a population of 34,239.  The population density in 2001 was , with a 100 to 94.9 femalemale ratio.() Of those over 16 years old, 28.6% were single (never married) and 42.8% married.()  Radcliffes 14,036 households included 28.1% one-person, 39.0% married couples living together, 9.2% were co-habiting couples, and 12.3% single parents with their children.()  The figures for married couples households was below the borough (48.5%) and national average (47.3%), and single parent households were slightly above the average for the whole of Bury (11.6%) and England (10.5%).( )  Of those aged 1674, 31.1% had no academic qualifications, slightly higher than averages of Bury (29.2%) and England (28.9%).(()The residential areas of Radcliffe both to the north and the south of the town centre operate as suburbs of Bury and Manchester, such that their populations are not necessarily linked to the town.  The socio-demographic characteristics of the towns population includes a mix of working and suburban middle classes, the layout of which are both linked to neighbouring towns.(Radcliffe is within the Manchester Urban Zone,() and within the Manchester to Work Area.() Economy Radcliffes first market was built by the Earl of Wilton and opened in 1851.(  The town was home to twelve Co-op stores,() the largest of which was on Stand Lane.  The four storey structure, built in 1877, had shops and offices on the ground floor, and a large area for public meetings on the second floor.()  The building was truncated to two stories in June 1971, and eventually demolished.()  Two more Co-op stores were located on Bury Street() and Cross Lane.()  The current market hall, built in 1937 on a different site to the old market, suffered a devastating fire in 1980() but was later restored.  Radcliffe was once served by several banks including the and Yorkshire Bank, the Manchester and Liverpool District Bank, the Bank of Manchester, and Parrs Bank ltd.()  Today both the Bank of Scotland and Halifax bank have branches in the town.()()thumb|The gate to the now demolished East Lancashire Paper MillRadcliffe has two weekly newspapers, the Radcliffe Times, based at the Bury Times offices, in Bury,() and the Salford-based The Advertiser, which also covers the neighbouring areas of Prestwich and Whitefield.()The construction in the 1980s of the A665 Pilkington Way Bypass relieved traffic congestion along the traditional route through the town, Blackburn Street. A new bridge across the Irwell was constructed for the road, and part of Blackburn Street was pedestrianised.  The road has attracted developments along former industrial land to the west of the town, including a large Asda supermarket, although it has exacerbated the decline of the retail outlets in the town centre.  The bypass has created problems for cyclists and pedestrians who appear reluctant to cross the road and visit the town centre.(()  One solution presently under consideration would involve a partial reopening of the pedestrianised section of Blackburn Street to traffic.()thumb|Dale Street in 1966. Trade within the towns shopping centre has declined in recent years.The closure of both the East Lancashire and Radcliffe Paper Mills, both of which employed thousands of people, has left a large gap in the towns local economy.(  Along with the decline of local industry the towns shopping centre has suffered a severe loss of trade and is now barely viable as a retail outlet.  The towns market hall compares poorly with the neighbouring Market.(  Amongst other shops, the towns central shopping precinct retains a Boots.( )  A Mill store now occupies the former site of the towns Asda supermarket.()Re-inventing Radcliffe is the name given on a report of a proposed improvement scheme.  The report envisages several initiatives, and includes the creation of new housing both to the north and south of the town.  Existing industry to the west of the town and along Milltown Street would be retained and improved, along with sections of the former Radcliffe Paper Mill and Pioneer Mill.  The market would be redeveloped along with the Save site and bus station, and the town could become a centre for the arts.  To improve transport links, new crossings of the Irwell and canal are proposed, along with a new school to replace the two existing schools.  Finally, the report suggests improving the image of Radcliffe within the Bury area.(thumb|600px|center|A panorama of Radcliffes main shopping area, Radcliffe PrecinctNewlands is a regeneration programme run by the Commission.()  One site under consideration for regeneration is the former waste tip of Radcliffe Ees.( Retrieved on 23 December 2008.) Population and employment change In 1921 2,394 men and 3,680 women were employed in the textile industry.()  By 1951 these figures had fallen respectively to 981 and 1,852.()  A more drastic fall is evident in the numbers of people employed in the mining and quarrying industries; in 1921 591 people were employed in both,( but in 1951 this had dropped to only 57,( reflecting the number of mines in and around Radcliffe that had by that time been completely exhausted.(By 2001, from a working population of 15,972 between the ages of 1674 only six people were employed in mining. 3,011 people were employed in manufacturing, 103 in public utilities, and 985 in construction.  3,371 people worked in wholesale and retailing; repair of motor vehicles, 682 in hotels and catering, and 1,185 in transport; storage and communication. 642 people worked in financial intermediation, 1,711 in real estate, 694 in administration and defence, 987 in education, 1,876 in health and social work, and 657 in other work.() Landmarks thumb|upright|Radcliffe CenotaphTower is all that remains of an early 15th century stone-built house.  The structure is a Grade I listed building and protected as a Monument.()()  The construction of a nearby barn is not documented, but it was probably built between 1600 and 1720.() It was used for storage of the local tithes (a tenth of a farms produce).()  Along with Radcliffe Tower, the Parish Church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building.()  The town also has two Grade II* listed buildings; Dearden Fold Farmhouse, completed during the 16th century,() and Radcliffe Cenotaph, built in 1922 to commemorate the First World War.()  Viaduct, and Radcliffes most visible landmark, St Thomas Church, are Grade II listed buildings.()  St Thomas took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by Grey de Wilton (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was consecrated in 1864 by the first of Manchester, Prince Lee.  Construction of the tower began in 1870() and the building was completed in 1871.  The building cost 7,273,( (0 today) and the tower cost 1,800 (0 today). The first vicar was the Reverend Robert Fletcher.Radcliffes first public ornament was a drinking fountain located at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road.  It was presented to the town by a Mrs Noah Rostron in memory of her husband, and erected in August 1896.()  The fountain no longer exists at this location.Built in 1911 the hall was on the junction of Water Street and Spring Lane.(  For many years after the town lost its district status, the building was unoccupied.  It was converted to private accommodation in 1999.() Transport The Manchester to Blackburn packhorse route passed through the town (hence the name Blackburn Street).  The bridge across the Irwell was likely first erected during the late Medieval period at the site of a ford.  An of Parliament in 1754 authorised the first turnpike through the hamlet of Radcliffe Bridge,() and included Manchester to Bury via Crumpsall, and from Prestwich to Radcliffe.  An Act of 1821 created a turnpike from Bury to Radcliffe, Stoneclough and Bolton.  An Act of 1836 created a turnpike from Starling Lane to Ainsworth, and Radcliffe to Bury and Manchester Road (near Fletcher Fold).  A turnpike from Whitefield to Radcliffe Bridge via Stand Lane was created in 1857 with houses at o th Barn, Stand Lane, the junction of Dumers Lane and Manchester Road, on Bolton Road near Countess Lane, and on Radcliffe Moor Road at Bradley Fold.  Radcliffe New Road was created in an Act of 1860 which enabled the construction of a toll road between Radcliffe and Whitefield.()  To prevent damage to the road surfaces, weighing machines were used at various strategic positions including at the bridge end of Dumers Lane, at Sandiford turning, and on Ainsworth Road.()()left|thumb|This 1911 map demonstrates the significant railway infrastructure through the townDuring the Revolution, as local cottage industries were gradually supplanted by the system the roads became inadequate for use.  A convoy of horse-drawn lorries carrying salt between Bealeys Bleach Works and Northwich would take up to two weeks to make a return journey.(  These problems gave rise to the construction of the Bolton & Bury Canal, which reached the town in 1796 and which was navigable throughout in 1808.  For 38 years the canal was the towns main route for trade and transport, with a wharf near Hampson Street.  The proprietors later converted into a railway company and built a line between Salford and Bolton, which opened in 1838.  A branch from this line was to have been built to Bury, along the line of the canal, but due to technical constraints this did not happen.()  Radcliffes closest railway connection therefore remained several miles distant at Stoneclough.(The opening of the Bury and Rossendale Railway (later known as the East Lancashire Railway (ELR)) in 1846() brought the town a direct connection to Manchester and Bury.  Two stations served the town, Radcliffe Bridge station, and Withins Lane station (although this closed in 1851 after only a few years of operation).  Ringley Road station was located to the south of the parish, close to the civil parish of Pilkington.  The line crossed the Irwell over Viaduct, an impressive structure which remains to this day.()The and Bury Railway (L&BR) opened on 28 November 1848, with a station to the north of the town, called Black Lane station. On 18 July 1872 the and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR), which had amalgamated with the ELR some years previously, gained an Act of Parliament to construct a railway between Manchester and Bury, via Whitefield and Prestwich.  This opened in 1879 with a new station, known as Radcliffe New Station,(From 1933 this station was renamed Radcliffe Central) with a link to the L&BR line at Bradley Fold (near the present day Chatsworth Road), and a new station along Ainsworth Road, Ainsworth Road Halt. The new L&YR route joined the existing ELR route near Withins Lane (North Junction), whereon they shared the connection to Bury.  The L&YR gained a further Act of 1877 to construct a link between North Junction and Coney Green Farm (West Junction). The LY&R line was electrified in 1916 for which a substation was constructed, between the canal and the West Fork.(Image:Metrolink at Dolly Molly.jpg|thumb|right|A Metrolink tram leaves Radcliffe, part of Greater Manchesters light rail public transport systemThe town also had an extensive tram network.  The first tram ran from Black Lane (latterly Ainsworth Road) in 1905, with a terminus next to St Andrews Church on Black Lane Bridge.  In 1907 a branch was built to connect to the Bury to Bolton part of the network.()  A large bus station is located between Dale Street and the river.()  Officially abandoned in 1961, the canal is currently undergoing restoration on the Salford arm,() although a rebuilt bridge along Water Street presents a barrier to its full restoration.()Public transport in Radcliffe is now coordinated by the Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE), a county-wide public body with direct operational responsibilities such as supporting (and in some cases running) local bus services, and managing ticketing in Greater Manchester.(The town is now served only by a single light rail system and regular bus services.(  The Metrolink opened on 6 April 1992 along the L&YR line between Manchester and Bury.()  Trams leave from the towns station every six minutes between 7:15 am and 6:30 pm, and every 12 minutes at other times of the day.()  Radcliffe Bridge station closed on 5 July 1958,() and has since been replaced by the path of the A665 Pilkington Way (the new road has been built below the level of the old station).(  The path of the ELR line is still quite visible from aerial photography, with Viaduct fully restored,() and the route of the line southwest of the town converted for use as a nature trail forming part of the Sculpture Trail.( ) Education thumb|upright|The former entrance to Radcliffe Technical School. The building is now used by the local council as office space.One of the earliest schools in the parish was the Close Wesleyan Day School, a school opened around 1840.()  St Thomass day school was opened on 4 March 1861, and housed over 500 children.  Due to overcrowding and the risk of subsidence caused by local mining activity, the school was rebuilt on a new site along School Street, provided by the Earl of Wilton.  It was opened in October 1877 by Lady Wilton.  On the opposite side of the town St Johns school started life in 1860 as an institute along Irwell Street, and by 1864 contained 120 children.  The buildings were enlarged in 1869.  In 1897 eight teachers and a monitor taught 358 children.  In 1899 the school leaving age was twelve, and many of the senior class were half-timers who would spend half the day at school, and the other half at work.  This system was abolished in 1919.  Regular epidemics of fever, pox, mumps, and especially measles, meant that in 1897 and 1903 the school was temporarily closed.()  St Johns school and the nearby Church were demolished in the 1970s.(  Radcliffe also had a Technical school on Whittaker Street.  Formally opened by Lord Stanley on 7 November 1896, it adjoined the public baths on Whittaker Street.() The building is now used as council offices.()Radcliffe County Secondary School was founded in 1933() on the former Peel Park Ground near School Street, but Radcliffes first secondary school (apart from an endowed school in nearby Stand) was held at the New Jerusalem schoolroom from the early 1860s.()  Radcliffe East, latterly known as Coney Green County Comprehensive School, was built in 1975 on the site of the former railway goods yard alongside Radcliffe East Fork.  Part of the school, known as Phase One, opened in September 1975, with 150 first-year pupils, and 70 second-year pupils (from Radcliffe County Secondary School).  The remainder, known as Phase Two, opened two years later.()Radcliffe has ten primary schools, and one secondary school which is spread across two sites.  Presently, these two secondary school sites have been renamed Radcliffe Riverside East Campus (Coney Green) and Radcliffe Riverside West Campus (Radcliffe High).  The lower school students in years 79 study at the Coney Green building, while the upper school students between years 1011 study in the Radcliffe High building.  A new school is proposed to replace Coney Green High School and Radcliffe High School,() however recent developments have delayed construction of the new school.() Religious sites thumb|Parish Church of St Mary, RadcliffeIn RomanoBritish times, Radcliffe was in the of York; in Saxon times in the Diocese of Lindesfarne, then of York; in Norman times in the Diocese of Lichfield; after 1540 in the Diocese of Chester and since 1847 in the Diocese of Manchester.()Based on the subdivisions of the dioceses, before 1535(The exact date is unknown.) Radcliffe ancient parish was in Manchester and Blackburn Deanery.  Between this date and 1850 the ancient parish was placed in Manchester Rural Deanery.  From 1850 to 1851 it was placed in Bury Rural Deanery; from 1851 to 1872 it was in Prestwich Rural Deanery; from 1872 to 1912, it was placed in Prestwich and Middleton Rural Deanery; and since 1872 it has been in Radcliffe and Prestwich Rural Deanery.() Church of England Radcliffe was an ancient parish which in its early history had duties which combined both ecclesiastical and civil matters.  In 1821 Radcliffe St. Thomas parish was created from the ancient parish, and it was re-founded in 1839.  In 1873 further parts of the ancient parish were taken to form Bury St. Peters ecclesiastical parish.  In 1878 parts of the ancient parish as well as part of Radcliffe St. Thomas were taken to form Radcliffe St. Andrew, Black Lane ecclesiastical parish.(  The Parish Church of St Mary was built during the 14th century, and the tower added in the 15th century.  In 1966 it was designated a I building by Heritage under its former name of the Church of St Mary and St Bartholomew.(  In 1991 some local parishes were merged, and the church adopted its present name.()thumb|The many chimneys visible in this 1902 image of the town give an indication as to the degree of industrialisation. The Church of St John is visible here.Radcliffe is also served by the Parish of St Thomas and St John.  St Thomas is visible on the horizon for many miles. The original church was built in 1819 by Countess Grosvenor() and is visible above in the image of Radcliffe Bridge.  The building was later considered too small, and in 1862 was demolished and replaced with the present structure (see landmarks).  The Church of St John was consecrated on 19 February 1866 at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road.  Built at a cost of about 4,000 (0 today) the site was donated to the church by the of Derby, who in 1897 also made a grant of land for the site of the Mission Church at Chapelfield.()  The parishes of St John and St Philip were merged with St Thomas in 19751976.( )(Both these churches were later demolished)  Radcliffe is also home to the Church of St Andrew on Ainsworth road, which was consecrated in 1877.() Other faiths Radcliffe was also home to many smaller churches.  The main Catholic church, St. Mary & St. Philip Neri, on Spring Lane, was built in 1894.()  Other churches included Stand Independent, a Quaker church on Foundry Street, Water Lane Congregational, and several Wesleyan churches, including one on Bridgefield Street, which in March 2008 was destroyed by fire.()  The church was built in 1892.()  The Reformed Church has two congregations within the town, one on Lord Street, and the other on Stand Lane.  The church was originally formed from a Congregational school in 1848.()  A New Connexion church has existed along Smyrna Street since 1844.()  Other faiths are also catered for, with a mosque on Bridgefield Street,() and a centre for Swedenborgianism on Radcliffe New Road.() Sports Radcliffe has a rich history of sport, including football, rugby, cricket and swimming, but entertainment in Radcliffe once included bear-baiting, bull-baiting, and cock-fighting.  Cock fights were prevalent in the town and took place in local hush-shops, generally viewed by invitation only.  Bull and bear baiting was held in the Radcliffe Bridge area of the parish.  In Nicholls History and Traditions of Radcliffe (1900) the author describes the contents of the diary of a Lord Kenyon, who wrote W.M. Robt. James, and Thomas Radcliffe, were fined for causing a Bayre to be bayted upon Saturday being the 18th of March 15878, at the Bull-Ringe neere the conduite in Manchester.()  Trained dogs were used to attack a bull, which was donated by the Earl of Wilton.  Such entertainment would take place where the bridge now stands, along the banks of the river near the ford.  Such spectacles were eventually outlawed by Act of Parliament, and the last bull bait in the town was held on 26 September 1838.  Horse racing replaced the sport the following year, with a course alongside the river.  During the first year of racing the main spectator stand collapsed, injuring many spectators.  In 1876 events were moved to a new course( approximately one mile in circumference() at Radcliffe Moor, upon which site the towns cricket club now stands.(The town is home to Lancashire Cricket League side Cricket Club.  For many years Frank Worrell played the club,( and a street near the cricket ground was named in his honour.()  Sir Sobers joined the club in 1958 at the age of 21.()  The town also has two teams, Radcliffe Town,() and Radcliffe Borough.  Famous former players include Gascoigne() and Derbyshire.() Public services  History The Pollution Prevention Act 1876 posed a problem for the local authorities; disposal of sewage was generally an expensive proposition, and efforts to resolve the practical problems involved were often unsatisfactory.  After initial experiments, in 1894 contracts were let for work.  Chairman of the Local Board Samuel Walker Esq cut the first sod on 23 April 1894, and the works were completed in the following year.()The town was provided with electricity by a coal-fired power station along the south bank of the river, to the west of the town.  Authorised by the Radcliffe Electric Lighting Order of 1894, and inaugurated on 5 October 1904,() Power Station was opened by the Earl of Derby on 9 October 1905.()  It originally had two 1,500 kW turbo sets made by Thomson-Houston, and was the first power station in the country to transmit electricity over bare electrical conductors.()In 1921 the Radcliffe and Little Lever Joint Gas Board purchased the Radcliffe & Pilkington Gas Company.  Constituted in 1921 by an Act of Parliament, the board consisted of six members of the Radcliffe Council and one member of the Little Lever Council.  The area supplied included all the districts of Radcliffe and Little Lever, and also Prestwich, Whitefield, Unsworth, Outwood, and Ainsworth.  In 1935 the company supplied  of gas to 16,748 consumers, and provided gas for public street lighting.

Italian_Canadians
relsPredominantly CatholicAn Italian Canadian is a Canadian of Italian descent or heritage. According to the 2006 census of Canada, 1,445,335 Canadians (4.6% of total population) consider themselves to be of Italian origin. The Italian-Canadian population climbed by more than 12% and half (over 700,000) have combined Italian origins along with another ethnic group, mostly other European ethnic groups.(Ethnocultural Portrait of Canada Highlight Tables, 2006 Census) Altogether, Italians continue to be the 5th largest ethnic group in Canada after British and Irish origins, French origin and German origin.HistoryThe first explorer to North America and to Canada was the Venetian Caboto (John Cabot). His voyage to Canada and other parts of the Americas was followed by his son Caboto and Janus Verrazanus (da Verrazzano). During the France era, France also occupied parts of Northern Italy and there was a significant Italian presence in the French military forces in the colony. Notable were de Tonty, who helped establish Detroit, and de Tonti, who journeyed with La Salle in his exploration of the River. Italians made up a small portion of the population, however, and quickly lost their ethnic identities. In 1881, only 1,849 Canadians claimed to be Italian. A number of Italians were imported to work as navvies in the construction of the Pacific Railway.A substantial influx began in the early twentieth century when over a hundred thousand Italians moved to Canada. These were largely peasants from rural Italy and agrarian parts of the north-east (Veneto, Friuli). They mainly immigrated to Toronto and Montreal, both of which soon had large Italian communities. Smaller communities also arose in Hamilton, Vancouver, Windsor, Niagara Falls, Ottawa, Sherbrooke, City, Sudbury and the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area. Many also settled in mining communities in Columbia, Alberta, Breton Island and Ontario. The Northern Ontario cities of Sault Ste. Marie and Fort William were quite heavily populated by Italian immigrants. There was a Royal Commission appointed to Inquire into the Immigration of Italian Labourers to Montreal and alleged Fraudulent Practices of Employment Agencies in 1905, which exposed the abuses of immigration agents known as padroni.This migration was largely halted by War I, and new immigration laws in the 1920s limited Italian immigration. During War II, Italian-Canadians, as well as German-Canadians were regarded with suspicion and faced a great deal of discrimination. Those who had been actively pro-Fascist, and some who were falsely accused, were interned at Petawawa during the war. There was no mass internment as befell Japanese-Canadians, however.A second wave occurred after the Second World War when Italians especially from the Latium and Abruzzo regions left the war-impoverished country for opportunities in a young and growing country. Many Italians from Istria and Dalmatia also immigrated to Canada, during this period, as persons (see exodus). In the 1960s, immigration laws were again changed, and the bias in favour of Europeans was removed. In the same period, Italy was rapidly growing in wealth, and by the early 1970s fewer Italians were interested in emigration.DemographicsAs of 2006, 1,449,695 Canadians residents stated they had Italian ancestry, in which 741,045 had sole Italian origins while the other 704,285 were of partial Italian origin along with other ethnic origins, chiefly with other European ethnic groups e.g. Italian-Irish, Italian-English, Italian-French, etc. The latter group climbed by almost 25%, while the Italian Canadian population as a whole grew by 12% since the 2001 census.Canadians of Italian ancestry make up 4.6% of the population of Canada, a rise from 4.3% in 2001. The majority live in Ontario (867,980) where they constitute more than seven per cent of the population, while another 300,000 live in Quebec.The main concentrations of Canadians of Italian ancestry are in the following metropolitan areas and agglomerations:In 2001, about three-quarters of the 1.3 million Canadians of Italian descent (903,375) were born in Canada according to the 2001 Census and 315,455 Canadian residents were born in Italy. Of those 315,000 immigrants, almost half (46.7%) immigrated to Canada before 1961, 38.3% between 1961 and 1970, another 10.3% between 1971 and 1980. Italian immigration to Canada since 1981 has been very slow with only 6.4% of Italian immigrants coming to Canada since 1981.More than half of Canadians of Italian origins (670,300) claimed English as their mother tongue, 81,000 French and 469,485 Italian. Their religious profile represents the historical ties with Italy. Out of the 1.3 million Italians in Canada, 1,015,725 or 79.9% are Catholic, 113,455 or 8.9% Protestant, 23,805 or 1.8% other Christian. Those who do not profess a faith constitute 109,515 or 8.2%. The largest non-Christian faith that some Italians follow is Judaism.Canadians of Italian ancestry had above-average incomes ($34,871 average employment income vs. $ 31,757 for all Canadians) and below-average unemployment rates (5.4% compared to 7.4% for the Canadian labour force as a whole). While they work in all walks of life, they represent a disproportionate number of Canadas construction workers: 6 % of Canadians employed in the construction industry are of Italian ancestry. On the other hand, they are under-represented in  agriculture. In other industries, the proportion of Canadians of Italian ancestry is not far from their percentage of the general population.Italian-Canadian mediaRadio and televisionThe first multicultural radio station in Canada (CFMB) began broadcasting at Montreal in 1962. Founded by Stanczykowkski, a Pole, peak hours programming was nonetheless mostly in Italian. Four years later, in 1966, Lombardi founded a similar radio station (CHIN) in Toronto. CFMB has become a cultural bulwark for Italians in Montreal, however, the stations programming is often criticized as being geared only toward the older generations. Hardly any new pop songs from Italy, for instance, receive airtime and older songs from the 1970s and 1980s are usually privileged. A short programme on Friday afternoons, Spazio ai giovani, was recently introduced to address these criticisms.Iannuzzi founded the first multicultural television station in Canada (CFMT-TV), which began operations at Toronto in 1979. Now owned by Rogers Communications, the service has spun off into two multicultural television services in southern Ontario: OMNI-1 and OMNI-2. TeleItalia, an Italian-language television service, was founded in Montreal shortly thereafter. TeleItalia shared airtime with other multicultural programming at the station but had the most and best timeslots. TeleItalia programming included programming purchased from RAI, the Italian state broadcaster, as well as numerous locally-produced programmes, including the nightly newscast at six oclock. In 1997, a reform of the citys multicultural television station (CJNT) saw a drastic decline in the quality of all programming and major cuts to airtime. At one time, CJNT was on air for less than twelve hours a day. The Global company later purchased the station and has since improved programming. Nevertheless, there is now little Italian programming shown.A third station, Telelatino (TLN) of Toronto, is widely available through cable distribution. Though offering programmes in both Spanish and Italian, most of TLNs revenue (70%) is derived from the latter. TLN, along with International, an arm of the Italian state broadcaster RAI, has recently been at the centre of a dispute over Italian-language broadcasting in Canada. Telelatino had carried since 1984 some RAI content in addition to locally produced shows and dubbed Spanish programming from Latin America. By the beginning of this decade, however, there was growing dissatisfaction with TLN programming, especially in Montreal. Critics in Montreal labelled TLNs locally-produced shows too Torontocentric and poked fun at dubbed Spanish programming bought from Latin American stations. Most of these latter shows were soap operas filmed in the 1980s.RAI controversyIn 2003, RAI pulled its content from Telelatino and petitioned the Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to set up its own channel. This effort was backed by Communications. The Italian community in Montreal was almost wholly in favour of admitting RAI. The Committee for Italians Living Abroad in Montreal (COM.IT.ES.), an arm of the Italian foreign ministry, led the campaign to have RAI admitted. The Italian community in Toronto, however, was divided. Some in Toronto saw the move as part of a scheme by Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi to gain greater influence over the Italian language media in Canada. Italian law provides the Italian diaspora votes in Italian elections and permanent seats in the Italian parliament. Unlike the more independent Telelatino, RAI was widely seen as pro-Berlusconi. Those in favour of the RAI in Montreal pointed out that TLN quickly replaced its RAI programming with shows bought from SKY, a private television network. Berlusconi is said to have much more control over his private TV companies than over the state-run RAI.In November 2003, community leaders in Montreal led a protest march in Ottawa under the slogan RAI Now. They then presented a petition with some tens of thousands of signatures in favour of their cause. The CRTC initially turned down the application allowing RAI International to broadcast in Canada, declaring it would be impossible to set up a domestic Italian channel if that came to pass. In Montreal editorials lambasting the federal government and the CRTC were published in the community newspapers and leaders spoke out again a perceived injustice. With a federal election set for the summer of 2004, one in which the Liberal Party did not seem guaranteed a victory, opinion makers in Montreal began asking if Italians were simply not sheep herded along by the Liberals. (The great majority of Italians in Montreal are Liberal and federalist). Many called on voters to vote against the Liberal party which was blamed for the CRTCs decision. Ultimately, nervous Liberal candidates signed a statement days before the vote, guaranteeing that RAI would be broadcasting within a year or that the laws would be changed to permit it. The Liberals won their election and in the spring of 2005, the CRTC reversed its earlier decision. RAI thus began broadcasting in June of that year.Newspapers and MagazinesThe first Italian-language newspaper in Canada was Cittadino Canadese  founded in Montreal in 1941, followed by Corriere Italiano, founded by Gagliardi also in Montreal in the early 1950s. Canadese, founded by Iannuzzi in 1954, is Canadas only Italian-language daily today and is published in Toronto; its weekend  (English-language) edition is published as Tandem. Other newspapers include Insieme (Montreal),di Ottawa (Ottawa, Ontario) and Il Postino (Ottawa, Ontario). Il Postino was established in 2000 by a young group of local Ottawa Italian Canadians to convey the history of the Italian community in Ottawa.  (www.ilpostinocanada.com). Insieme was originally founded by the Italian Catholic parishes of Montreal but has since been put under private ownership. It nevertheless retains an emphasis on religious articles.Many of the older Italian newspapers are criticized, like CFMB radio, for only serving the interests of the older generations. Several trendier, more modern magazines or newspapers have thus been founded. Many are run by recent Italian immigrants to Canada and are geared towards youth. Panoram Italia magazine, a bimonthly publication distributed in the Greater Montreal and Toronto areas, is the most popular among them. However, most others have failed or are published sporadically due to financial problems. The movement to support these upstart newspapers, however, is fairly strong in Montreal where many people under 40 years old can still communicate in Italian. Eyetalian magazine was launched in 1993 as a challenging, independent magazine of Italian-Canadian culture. It encountered commercial difficulty, and leaned towards a general lifestyle magazine format before concluding publication later in the 1990s. Italo of Montreal is published sporadically and is written in Italian, with some articles in French and English. Dealing with current affairs and community news. Comunit, while an older publication, was taken over by the youth wing of the Congress of Italian Canadians (Qubec chapter) in the late 1990s. It experimented with different formats but was later cancelled due to lack of funding.Notable Canadians of Italian descentMany Italian immigrants found work in the constructions trades, and later built their own construction businesses. Canadians of Italian ancestry can now be found in almost any profession in Canada.

Margarets_Museum
Margarets Museum is a critically acclaimed 1995 British-Canadian dark film drama, directed by Ransen and based on Curries novel Glace Bay Miners Museum.Set in the 1940s in Breton Island, Scotia, it tells the story of a young girl living in a coal mining town where the death of men from accidents in the pit (the mines) has become almost routine. Margaret MacNeil (Bonham Carter) has already lost her father and an older brother and for her, life alone would be prefereable to marrying a mine worker  that is until the charming Neil Currie (Russell) shows up. Against the wishes of her hard-bitten mother (Nelligan) they marry, but before long financial woes lead to his doing what every other uneducated young man does in the town: take a job underground. His death in the mine drives Margaret to a breakdown and in her surreal world she decides to create a special museum to the memories of all those who have died as a result of the horrific mining conditions. The advent of the film inspired the organization PAMAUG, which strongly advocates the usage of means other than manual labor to extract coal from mines.Part of Margarets Museum was filmed in the UK. It carried significance in the local area of Newtongrange, Scotland as the screen debut of local TV celebrity David MacBeath, who appeared as an extra in the film.Tagline: She found a way to preserve her memories forever.

Nevada_Northern_Railway_Museum
 refnum93000693 (yards), 84002082 (depot)The Nevada Northern Railway Museum is a railroad museum located in Ely, Nevada and operated by a historic foundation dedicate to the preservation of the railroad.Museum activities include restoration and operation of historic railroad equipment, steam-powered excursions throughout the year, winter photo shoots, locomotive rentals, hand car races, lectures, an annual railroad history symposium, changing exhibits, and a variety of special events.   LocationThe museum is situated at the East Ely Yards, which are part of the Northern Railway.  The site is listed on the States Register of Historic Places as the Nevada Northern Railway East Ely Yards and Shops and is also known as the Nevada Northern Railway Complex. The rail yards were listed as a National Historic Landmark of the United States on September 27, 2006.(The Nevada Northern Railway Complex is the best-preserved, least altered, and most complete main yard complex remaining from the steam railroad era. It was established in 1905 to support the areas booming copper mining industry. The era of dieselization of the railroad industry during the second half of the 20th century led to alterations and demolitions of railroad yards and shops nationwide. The East Ely yard escaped modernization because of its geographical remoteness and the decline of the mining industry it once served.(U.S. Senator Harry Reids website)CollectionThe museum collection includes three locomotives, an locomotive, and several locomotives, as well as a collection of maintenance equipment and numerous historic freight and passenger rail cars.  Usually two of the steam locomotives are in operation in regularly scheduled events throughout the year.  Check the web site for details.The museum also maintains an extensive fleet of its original rolling stock, including passenger cars, wood-side box cars, ore cars, and work trains, all dating from the 1910s.  It has the oldest operating tank car and the oldest operating coal-fired steam crane on any American railroad.  During the Winter Olympics, held in Lake City, the railroad was part of the Olympic Steam Team, carrying spectators to the Hollow Olympic venue. The railroads No. 93 steam-engine, joined Utahs Heber Valley Railroads Nos. 618 and 75 steam-engines, in pulling eight-car trains full of passengers, to the Soldier Hollow depot where they disembarked and continued to the venue entrance on a horse-drawn sleigh.() The day prior to the Opening Ceremony of the games, all three locomotives were combined into one triple-headed train, and used to transport the Olympic flame from Soldier Hollow to City, Utah as part of the torch relay.()Depot buildingThe East Ely Depot served passengers on the Nevada Northern. The Mission Revival style depot was designed by Frederick Hale and built in 1907. It reflects a standardized vernacular that borrows primarily from the Mission Revival style, as well as from Revival.The two story depot is set on a stone foundation.  The ground floor is rusticated stone, separated from the upper level by a painted stone course, with a stuccoed second story. The gables are curvilinear in the accepted Mission Revival style. The well-preserved interior retains separate mens and womens waiting rooms, with baggage and express rooms. Offices are on the second floor.()The depot was a significant location on the Nevada Northern as the chief embarkation point for the copper mining region of White Pine County. The location of the depot was a matter of controversy between the railroad and residents of Ely, who successfully sued the railroad to change the depots name from Ely to East Ely to reflect its distance from the main townsite. The railroad, originally owned by the Nevada Consolidated Copper Company, was transferred to the Kennecott Copper Company in 1933 when it took over Consolidateds mining operations. Passenger service on the Nevada Northern stopped in 1941,( and the depot was used for Kennecott offices until 1985. The state of Nevada acquired the depot in 1990 for the  museum.The East Ely Depot was listed on the Register of Historic Places in 1984.(Heritage railroadThe museum operates a short rail line that was formerly owned by the Nevada Northern Railway as a heritage railroad.  This line was called the Ore Line and the museum runs excursion trains westward from Ely to Ruth, and northeast from Ely to the vicinity of McGill.  One of the trains is advertised as the Ghost Train of Old Ely. References  External links *Nevada Northern Railway Museum websiteNorthern Railway Museum

Robin_Vane-Tempest-Stewart,_8th_Marquess_of_Londonderry
Edward Charles Stewart Robert Robin Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 8th Marquess of Londonderry, DL (18 November 1902  17 October 1955) was an Irish peer and politician.Educated at College he was the only son of Stewart Henry Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 7th Marquess of Londonderry and Edith Helen Chaplin.He worked as honorary attach to the British Embassy in Rome and as a director of Londonderry Collieries, the familys coal mining company. A keen football fan, he was first a director, and then later chairman of Arsenal Football Club from 1939 to 1946. A portrait of him painted in 1911 as a pageboy at the coronation of Edward VII by de Laszlo hangs at Stewart, Down, the Londonderry ancestral seat in Ireland.Known formally by his courtesy title Viscount Castlereagh and as Robin by friends and family, he was an accomplished public speaker and was Unionist of Parliament (MP) for Down in the House of Commons between 1931 and 1945. He succeeded his father as Marquess of Londonderry in 1949.He was married in 1931 to Romaine Combe (d. 1951), daughter of Major Boyce Combe, of Farnham, Surrey, and had issue:*Lady Jane Antonia Frances Vane-Tempest-Stewart (b. 1932), who married Max Rayne, Baron Rayne in 1965, and has issue. *Lady Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart (b. 1934).*Charles Robert Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 9th Marquess of Londonderry (b. 1937).Lord Londonderry was a celebrated host and practical joker, apparently once decorating the Christmas tree at Wynyard with condoms to startle a visiting cleric. He was also an attentive husband and devoted father to his children, entertaining them with stories and tales for hours on end. Also regarded as slightly eccentric, on one occasion Lord Londonderry had taken to his bed after a few drinks too many, when Mrs Billy Graham, wife of the evangelist, came to call. Although informed that His Lordship was indisposed, Mrs Graham insisted upon immediate admission to his bedroom,having come all the way on Billys account. She was duly announced. Lord Londonderry threw aside the bed-sheets and shouted, Get in.(Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh. The Unvarnished Picture, The Spectator, October 26, 2002. Accessed March 25, 2008.)But he had an awkward and distant relationship with his parents, especially his father. The two men took opposite sympathies during industrial disputes over the family coal mines and most notably during the strike in 1926. When he was married to Romaine, a brewers daughter, his family viewed the union with disdain. It was a very happy marriage by all accounts, but tragedy struck when Lady Londonderry died from cancer and Lord Londonderry plunged into depression and alcoholism.Daddy changed, literally overnight, into a complete drunk, she (Lady Annabel Goldsmith) remembers. It was awful. He would collapse while making speeches to the cricket club, that kind of thing. He was on the bottle night and day.(Langley, William. Profile: Lady Annabel Goldsmith, The Sunday Telegraph, October 6, 2007. Accessed March 25, 2008.)Lord Londonderry died from liver failure on 17 October 1955 aged 52. He was buried alongside his wife at Wynyard Park and both were later reinterred in the Londonderry family vault at St. Marys Church, Long Newton, County Durham.

James_Douglas_(governor)
British ColumbiaSir James Douglas KCB (August 15, 1803  August 2, 1877) was a company fur-trader and a British colonial governor on Vancouver Island in northwestern North America, particularly in what is now Columbia.  Douglas worked for the West Company, and later for the Bay Company becoming a high-ranking company officer.  From 1851 to 1864, he was Governor of the of Vancouver Island. In 1858 he also became the first Governor of the of British Columbia, in order to assert British authority during the Canyon Gold Rush, which had the potential to turn the B.C. Mainland into an American state. He remained governor of both Vancouver Island and British Columbia until his retirement in 1864. He is often credited as The Father of British Columbia. Early life and fur traderJames Douglas was born in Demerara (now part of Guyana) to John Douglas, a Scottish planter, and Martha Ann Tefler, a Creole originally from Barbados.  Telfer was free coloured, which in her time and place meant a free person of mixed European and African ancestry.  The couple had a number of children together, but were not formally married.(Adams, John. 2001. Old Square-Toes and His Lady: The Life of James and Amelia Douglas. Victoria, BC: Horsdal and Schubert. P. 1.)  In 1812 James was sent to Lanark, Scotland to be schooled. It is also believed that he went to school in England, where he learned to speak and write in fluent French. At the age of sixteen Douglas left Britain to enter the trade in the employ of the West Company. He left Liverpool for Lachine, Canada (now part of Montreal) in the spring of 1819. From 1819 until 1820 Douglas was stationed at the William, Ontario (now part of Bay) as a clerk. In 1820 he was transferred to le--la-Crosse on the River in northern Saskatchewan. The Bay Company (HBC) was also active in this area and Douglas was caught up in at least one confrontation with the rival fur traders. At this post Douglas continued a policy of self-education by reading books brought over from Britain and meeting with many Nations people.In 1821 the North West Company was merged into the Hudsons Bay Company and Douglas contract was placed onto the HBCs payroll. He quickly moved up the strict structure of the company, and in 1825 was put in charge of the foundation of the Fort Vermilion trading post in what is now northern Alberta. He was then stationed at Fort St. James on Lake, headquarters of the Companys New Caledonia District. In 1827 he established Fort Connolly on Bear Lake. On April 27, 1828, Douglas married the daughter of New Caledonias Factor William Connolly, Amelia Connolly. Amelias mother had been Cree. Douglas was very close to William Connolly, his superior. Connolly was impressed by Douglas skills and they got along well, resulting in Connolly agreeing to the marriage between the two.In 1828, while Douglas was in charge of Fort St. James in Connollys absence, two Hudsons Bay traders were murdered with the help of a Stuart Lake native. In one of the most controversial moments of Douglas life he marched into the village and seized the accused murderer. Unfortunately the exact events of the day are not clear. In some accounts Douglas shot the native in the head on the spot with everyone watching. In others, Douglas simply dragged him out of the village to be executed at a later time. Another story is that Douglas attempted to shoot the man in the head but missed and had to get his partners to beat the accused before dragging him out of the village. Various stories were passed around the area and Douglas soon acquired a negative reputation among the local First Nations. Connolly, fearing for Douglas life, asked HBC Governor George Simpson to transfer Douglas elsewhere. He was thus moved to Vancouver, headquarters of the Companys District, located near the mouth of the River in present-day Washington. His wife joined him after the death of their first child in 1830. While in Fort Vancouver she gave birth to ten more children (five died in infancy).Years in Fort Vancouver and Fort VictoriaDouglas spent nineteen years in Vancouver, serving as Accountant until 1834 when he was promoted to Trader of the post. This was a very important position - only held by four others in the District. He received his commission as one of the gentlemen of the interior on June 3, 1835 in Factory upon joining the Council of the Northern Department. In 1838 Douglas was put in charge of the District. While occupying the position Douglas denounced slavery of natives and made settlement with the American Company, which had been active in the northern coastal fur trade. In return for the leasing of fur trading territory on the northern coast from Fairweather south to 5440, the Russian-American Company received 2000 otter pelts and a number of other supplies. He also created the Sound Agricultural Company in an attempt to bring more British into the Columbia River valley to overpower the American presence there.Image:Blanshard.gif|thumb|left|Blanshard, Douglas predecessor as Governor of the of Vancouver IslandIn September 1840 he was awarded with a commission as Factor, the highest possible rank for field service with the HBC. As Chief Factor his first major contribution was to go on a personal visit south to California, where he met with a Mexican administrator and received permission to create a trading post in Francisco. In 1841 Douglas was charged with the duty of setting up a trading post on the southern tip of Island, upon the recommendation by George Simpson that a second line of forts be built in case the Columbia River valley fell into American hands (see boundary dispute). Charged with this task, Douglas founded Fort Victoria, on the site of present-day British Columbia. This proved beneficial when in 1846 the Treaty was signed, extending the North America/States border along the 49th parallel from the Rockies to the Strait of Georgia.In 1849 Britain leased the entirety of Vancouver Island to the HBC with a condition that a colony was to be created. Douglas moved the headquarters of the western portion of the Company from Fort Vancouver to Fort Victoria. He was not initially appointed to be Governor of the of Vancouver Island - the position instead went to Blanshard, an English barrister. However, most practical authority rested with Douglas, as the chief employer and person in charge of its finances and land, and he effectively drove Blanshard from the position. Douglas acknowledged the Proclamation of 1763 and had a policy to trade the natives for their land. Costs for each parcel of land were usually in the form of blankets, often three for each man. This policy also stemmed from a desire to have good interactions with natives while avoiding violence. After the resignation of Blanshard in 1851, the British Government appointed Douglas as the Governor of Vancouver Island. However, he was still Chief Factor of the HBC, which led to a number of years of balancing the important and time-consuming duties of both positions and was often the subject of controversy in local political debates and editorial tirades.Governor of the Colony of Vancouver IslandAs Governor, Douglas faced a number of significant challenges, not least of which was the expansionist pressure of the neighbouring States of America. Using his meagre resources, Douglas created the Voltigeurs, Vancouver Islands first militia, using money from the Company and composed of Metis and French-Canadians in the companys service. He also used the sparse presence of the Navy for protection. During the War, in 1854, the British and French carried out an attack on Petropavlovsk and casualties were sent to Victoria. After facilities of this key port proved inadequate the British government charged Douglas with the creation of a hospital at Esquimalt harbour along with the improvement of Royal Navy supply capacity. This base proved to be important and successful when in 1865 the headquarters of the North Pacific Squadron were moved to Vancouver Island.In 1859, Douglas also found his colony embroiled in a dispute with Territory over sovereignty in the Juan Islands. The protracted, twelve-year standoff came to be known as the War. Douglas pressed Britain to exert sovereignty over all islands in the archipelago dividing the of Georgia from Sound.  Named for the largest island of the group, the San Juans Islands are immediately adjacent to Victoria and so were of great strategic interest and worry. While opposing troops remained garrisoned on Juan Island, the dispute was eventually settled by arbitration in favour of the USA.Douglas largest problem in the mid- and late-1850s concerned relations with the majority First Nations population - numbered at around 30,000 local Songhees, Cowichan, Nanaimo, Nuu-chah-nulth, including raiding Haida from the Charlotte Islands and the Euclataws Kwakiutl of northern Georgia Strait and the Sechelt, Swxw7mesh, and Sto:lo peoples of the Mainland. In contrast, Europeans in the Colony numbered under 1000. Meanwhile, in neighbouring Oregon and Territory the Cayuse and Wars and other conflicts between Americans and indigenous peoples were raging. Douglas relations towards First Nations peoples were mixed. On the one hand, Douglas wife was Cree, he had established many close business and personal relationships with indigenous peoples as a fur trader, and he sought to conclude treaties (the Treaties) with First Nations on southern Vancouver Island. On the other hand, Douglas supplied Washington Territorys Governor Stevens with arms and other supplies to assist the American government in its conflict with Native American tribes, and the treaties he concluded were later criticized as having provided woefully inadequate compensation in return for large swaths of territory (in most cases, a few blankets or a few shillings).  The treaties, concluded between 1850 and 1854, acquired fourteen parcels of land for the Crown from the native peoples, totalling 570 km2. The treaty-making was halted after the Colony ran out of money to pursue its expansion policy.(Canada in the Making - Aboriginals: Treaties & Relations)Other actions during Douglas time as governor include the creation of public elementary schools, attempts to control alcohol and the construction of the Victoria District Church (forerunner to the Christ Church Cathedral). In 1856, as ordered by the British Government, Douglas reluctantly established an elected Legislative Assembly. This was a turning point for Douglas, who was accustomed to administering the colony with absolute authority. The council was opposed to Douglas on many issues, and consistently criticized him for having a of interests between the Company and the colony. The Fraser Canyon Gold Rush In 1856 gold was discovered in the River, a tributary of the River, and a year later in the Fraser River itself. This sparked an influx of miners and others, as word of the discoveries spread south to the United States. Thousands of Americans flooded into British Columbia, beginning the Canyon Gold Rush. Douglas, although he had no political authority on the mainland, felt compelled to exert British jurisdiction over the territory, and stationed a warship at the mouth of the Fraser in order to issue licences to prospectors and merchants. A major task during the huge inflow of settlers was to prevent violence between the recent arrivals and the local natives. Due to the Wars, American animosity against natives was often high. In the fall of 1858, escalating tensions between the miners and the Nlakapamux people of the central area of the canyon broke into the Canyon War.Douglas actions in asserting British sovereignty over the mainland is generally conceded today to have helped exert control over American miners, and undermine American territorial ambitions toward this part of British North America. Shortly thereafter, the Colonial Office formally ratified Douglas proclamation of sovereignty and established a new colony encompassing the mainland.Governor of two coloniesIn 1858 the British Parliament created the of British Columbia, and appointed Douglas as Governor. It was after this act that Douglas was asked to resign as Chief Factor of the western portion of the Hudsons Bay Company. The Companys trade monopoly on the mainland was not renewed, and neither was Douglas position as Chief Factor. A judge, Baillie Begbie (the so-called hanging judge), was sent out to help Douglas maintain order and uphold British law in the area. Along with the judge came a contingent of Engineers, to construct the infrastructure (mainly roads and bridges) needed to help open the resources of the land to be exploited by the colony. Soon after his appointment as Governor, Douglas was awarded with an appointment as a Commander of the of the Bath in recognition of his service as Governor of Vancouver Island.In August 1858 news reached Douglas that two Vancouver Island miners had been killed by natives. He believed that the whole region was on the verge of war and went out to investigate. There had been numerous minor clashes between natives and whites but they had not yet resulted in death. After investigating the situation he found that alcohol had been a major cause, and prohibited the sale of liquor to natives. While on the trip to the murder scene Douglas brought the Crown Solicitor of Vancouver Island in order to uphold the law and make a show that pronounced that British law was still in effect. During this trip he encountered a great number of squatting foreigners, reducing the total possible revenues for land sales to the government.In attempt to keep unlawful acts as infrequent as possible Douglas appointed regional constables, a Chief Inspector of Police (Brew), and a network of intelligence officials. He also created Assistant Gold Commissioners (the Chief Gold Commissioner was also Chartres Brew) to look after mining and civil cases. Such preventive measures helped ensure that the chaos accompanying the California gold rush was not repeated in British Columbia.Continuing his service as governor of Vancouver Island, Douglas authorised construction of the government buildings known as the Birdcages in 1859. Then in 1862, with the discovery of rich gold deposits in the Cariboo region, sparking the Gold Rush, Douglas ordered the construction of the Road, an engineering feat running 400 miles from Fort Yale to Barkerville through extremely hazardous canyon territory. The Cariboo road was also called the Queens Highway and the Great North Road.Near the end of his rule as Governor, Douglas was criticized for not changing the colony into a self-governing body. Instead, the only act of reform in this fashion was in the creation of an elected Legislative Council. His argument against the creation of a self-governing colony was the state of the population: few were British subjects, most did not hold permanent residence within the colony, and of those few owned property.He was friends with Ker the First Auditor General of the Two Colonies of British Columbia, and Sebastian Helmcken a future of the House of the Assembly of British Columbia, both of whom, like Douglas, are considered founding fathers of British Columbia. Helmcken married Douglas daughter Cecilia.Retirement and deathWhen his service to the Empire ended, Victoria increased his position in the Order of the Bath to Knight Commander. Upon his retirement Douglas was honoured with banquets both in Victoria and New Westminster, the capital of the mainland. He also received a thank you on paper signed by 900 people. In 1864 and 65 Douglas toured Europe. He visited relatives in Scotland and a half-sister in Paris. However, he had to come home after his daughter, Cecilia, died.Douglas kept an active lifestyle but stayed out of politics in all forms. He died in Victoria of a heart attack on August 2, 1877 at the age of 73. His funeral procession was possibly the largest in the history of B.C. and he was interred in the Bay Cemetery.Places named for DouglasImage:James douglas 3.jpg|left|thumb|Grave of Sir James Douglas at Bay Cemetery in Victoria, BC*Douglas, British Columbia is a former community located on the northern end of Lake.*The Ranges, a southermost portion of the Mountains west of Harrison Lake and east of Lake.*The Road was an important wagon road that ran via a series of lake portages from Harrison Lake north to Lillooet.*Douglas is the name of a Canada-US border crossing in BC.*Peak is a 1486 m mountain of the Island Ranges, located southeast of Alberni.*Mount Douglas is a prominent, 260 m hill in the Victoria municipality of Saanich.

Mosborough
Mosborough ward &mdash; which includes the districts of Halfway, Mosborough village, Waterthorpe, and  Westfield &mdash; is one of the 28 electoral wards in City of Sheffield, England. It is located in the eastern part of the city, on the border with Rotherham, and covers an area of 8.9 km2. The population of this ward in 2001 was 16,300 people in 7,000 households. It is one of the wards that make up the Sheffield South East constituency. The area is often referred to as Mosborough Townships.Districts of Mosborough wardImage:Supertramhalf.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Supertram at Halfway.HalfwayHalfway () lies in the extreme southeast of Sheffield at the end of a Supertram line. Halfway is part of the historic county of Derbyshire but has been administered by Sheffield since boundary changes in 1967.It used to be home to a garage which was operated by Booth and Fisher, a company who were merged into the Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive in the mid 1970s. The garage itself passed into the hands of operator SYT, then to the First and has always been seen as a minor outpost garage. It serves works and school services plus buses starting early from the south side of the city. The garage was closed in 2007 as a cost cutting measure.It is common to see transport in Sheffield heading for Halfway. The Blue Route Supertram terminates at Halfway with a large and Ride facility. The main frequent bus that goes to and from Halfway to and from the city centre is the Stagecoach 120 service (South Yorkshire also run the 120 route to Halfway during the evening).The Halfway housing estate is something of a unique experiment. Built in 1975, the estate centred in the small local shopping centre called Streetfields. The houses themselves were built on high quality farmland and to this day there are a number of farmers with orchards nearby.The Sheffield City Council is a keen recycler and burn a lot of domestic refuse which in turn is converted to hot water used for both domestic supply and central heating. This is pumped from Bernard Road in S2 to Halfway and links directly with the homes in the Halfway locality. Well-insulated and often compact, these homes are noticeably energy efficient.The layout of the estate was such that no house would look directly onto another with properties curving around meandering walkways and a complex network of through routes to Halfway Drive. This main road is the thoroughfare linking the village to both the Derbyshire county boundary and neighbouring estates of Westfield and Waterthorpe.Despite a well planned and high quality overall project, the estate today suffers in part from crime and has been commented from the Sheffield City Council website as an area to work actively towards safer communities.HolbrookHolbrook was a mining village whose name was changed to Halfway (after the Halfway House pub) to avoid confusion with Holbrook nearr Derby.MosboroughMosborough ()  is part of the historic county of Derbyshire but has been administered by Sheffield since boundary changes in 1967 and is now considered a suburb of Sheffield. It was known for sickle making and was also a mining area. Notable buildings include the fifteenth century Hall, a building which may retain some Anglo-Saxon structure.The suburb has many high quality houses, local independent shops and hotel conference facilities.The original village of Mosborough has seven pubs and one working mens club:* The Alma* George and Dragon* Royal Oak* Vine Tavern* Queen Hotel* British Oak* The WheelThe working mens club is the CIU affiliated Miners Welfare.On August Bank Holiday, the locals do a crawl known as the Mosborough 10 for charity often in fancy dress. It has been known for people to come from as far away as Blackpool to take part in this event.The Mosborough 10 pub crawl travels from pub to pub:* The Vine Tavern* The Alma* The George & Dragon* The Royal Oak* The Wheel* The Queen Hotel* The British Oak* The Double Top* The Joseph Glover* The Miners WelfareWaterthorpeHousing Estate near Beighton named after Waterthorpe (formerly Walterthorpe) FarmBoth Waterthorpe and Westfield housing estates were built from 1980 and were added to over a number of years. Eventually linking with both the old council estate of Beighton and the new estate of Halfway, the estates house a condensed significant number of almost wholly local authority owned properties following the phasing down and demolition of the original estates around Cross and Shiregreen in the north of the City.The Peaks shopping centre was built in 1986 to serve the south side of the city. Its original design included markets and fixed national chains who made the centre one of the most popular in the county. Over time, the centre has suffered from a lack of investment and with the neighbouring Meadowhall trade has reduced. Between 2005 and 2008, the centre underwent a complete refurbishment and expansion, which doubled the size of the centre as well as providing a larger Sainsburys store. This development allows Crystal Peaks to complete more effectively with Meadowhall and the city centre.As for Waterthorpe and Westfield estates, leisure facilities are lacking as the council concentrated upon housing and not the substantial areas of parkland in most other areas of Sheffield.WestfieldHousing Estate near Halfway named after Westfield FarmWestfield is one of the Mosborough Townships, smallish self-contained communities that have yet to develop into communities. It is on the fringes of Sheffield, overlooks Derbyshire and is surrounded to the north by quite densely populated housing and to the south by open countryside. It has a small but well-equipped shopping centre: though the architect who designed the shopping centre does seem to have come from some communist Eastern European school of architecture in the 1950s.The housing is mixed with pleasant private estates interwoven with public sector housing which was originally aimed at the more vulnerable and/or elderly tenants. In about 2006, the local primary school, the community centre and the doctors surgery were burnt out. Recovery is under way, the school (Shortbrook Primary) has reopened and will have largely new staff from September 2008. Westfield Secondary School was relocated from its former position in Mosborough village and opened its doors on the border of Westfield in 2007. There are still problems with the community facilities. The council has now agreed to invest in the recovery of Westfield. They are investing about 500,00. The local Co-op are also investing, as are the Primary Care Trust.Hopefully, Westfield will be restored to its former fine status, but in 2008 it looks like it will take a good few years to recover.External links*- MosboroughWeb - Mosboroughs Community Websiteit:Mosborough

RAF_battle_honours
Battle Honours are awarded by the Sovereign to Air Force squadrons to commemorate the squadrons role in a particular operation.This practice was inherited by the RAF from its Army and Navy predecessors upon its creation in 1918.  Several squadrons therefore carry honours awarded when they were a part of the Flying Corps or Naval Air Service.  Battle honours are not awarded for every operation conducted by British forces and not every squadron taking part in an operation is entitled to emblazon the honour on their standard, only those involved in contact with the enemy.In 1943, King George VI approved the award of a Standard to RAF squadrons who have  25 years of service in either the RAF, Auxiliary Air Force, Royal Naval Air Service or Royal Flying Corps.  Standards can also be awarded to units which have earned the Kings appreciation for outstanding operations.  A squadron can embroider the names of up to 10 battle honours on its standard, known as emblazoning the honour.Below is lists of battle honours which may be claimed by RAF squadrons.First World War Battle Honours*Megiddo 1918Inter-War Battle Honours*Aden 1928  	*Aden 1929  	*Aden 1934*Afghanistan 19191920 	*Burma 19301932 	*Iraq 19191920*Iraq 19231925 	*Iraq 19281929 	*Kurdistan 1919*Kurdistan 19221924 	*Kurdistan 19301931 	*Mahsud 19191920*Mohmand 1927 	*Mohmand 1933 	*Northern Kurdistan 1932*Northern Russia 19181919 	*North West Frontier 19301931 	*North West Frontier 19351939*North West Persia 1920 	*Palestine 19361939 	*Somaliland 1920*South Persia 19181919 	*South Russia 19191920 	*Sudan 1920*Transjordan 1924 	  	*Waziristan 19191925Second World War Battle Honours*Anzio And Nettuno.:For operations in support of the Allied landings in Italy 916 September 1943.*Arakan 19421944.:For operations by fighter, bomber and transport squadrons in support of the First and Second Arakan Offensives, November 1942 to February 1943 and November 1943 to March 1944.*Arctic 19401945.:For operations over the Arctic by squadrons of Coastal Command based in Iceland, Russia and Shetland.*1944.:For squadrons participating in the operations of the Allied Airborne Army, 1726 September 1944.*Atlantic 19391945.:For operations by aircraft of Command and others employed in the coastal role over the Atlantic Ocean from the outbreak of war to VE Day.*Baltic 19391945.

Louis_and_Bebe_Barron
Bebe Barron (16 June 1925 &ndash; 20 April 2008) and Louis Barron (23 April 1920 &ndash; 1 November 1989) were two American pioneers in the field of music. They are credited with writing the first electronic music for tape, and the first entirely electronic score for the MGM movie Planet (1956).()Bebe BarronShe was born as Charlotte May Wind in Minneapolis on June 16, 1925, the only child of Ruth and Frank Wind. She earned her music degree at the of Minnesota in 1947. She moved to New York, and worked as a researcher for Time-Life and studied composition.( She studied music with Riegger and Cowell.() She married Louis in 1947 and he nicknamed her Bebe. They lived in Greenwich Village. She died on April 20, 2008 in Angeles.()Louis BarronHe was born on 23 April 1920 in Minneapolis. As a young man, Louis had an affinity for working with a gun and electrical gear. He studied music at the of Chicago. He died on 1 November 1989 in Angeles.()Early worksThe couple married in 1947 and moved to York City. Louis cousin, who was an executive at the Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), gave the newlyweds their first recorder as a wedding gift.() Using their newly acquired equipment, the couple delved into the study of concrte.The first music for tape composed in America was completed by Louis and Bebe in 1950 and was titled Heavenly Menagerie. music composition and production were one and the same, and were slow and laborious. Tape had to be physically cut and pasted together to edit finished sounds and compositions.MethodThe 1948 book Cybernetics: Or, Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine, by mathematician Wiener from MIT played an important role in the development of the Barrons composition.( The science of cybernetics proposes that certain natural laws of behavior apply to both animals and more complex electronic machines. By following the equations presented in the book, Louis was able to build circuits which he manipulated to generate sounds.( Most of the tonalities were generated with a circuit called a modulator. The sounds and patterns that came out of the circuits were unique and unpredictable because they were actually overloading the circuits until they burned out to create the sounds.  The Barrons could never recreate the same sounds again, though they later tried very hard to recreate their signature sound from Forbidden Planet. Because of the unforeseen life span of the circuitry, the Barrons made a habit of recording everything.Most of the production was not scripted or notated in any way. The Barrons didnt even consider the process as composition themselves. The circuit generated sound was not treated as notes, but instead as actors. In future soundtrack composition, each circuit would be manipulated according to actions of the underlying character in the film.After recording the sounds, the couple manipulated the material by adding effects, such as reverb and tape delay. They also reversed and changed the speed of certain sounds. The mixdown of multiple sounds was performed with at least three tape recorders. The outputs of two machines would be manually synchronized, and fed into an input of a third one, recording two separate sources simultaneously. The synchronization of future film work was accomplished by two 16 mm projectors that were tied into a 16 mm tape recorder, and thus ran at the same speed.While Louis spent most of his time building the circuits and was responsible for all of the recording, Bebe did the composing. She had to sort through many hours of tape.( She described it, it just sounded like dirty noise.  Over time, she developed the ability to determine which sounds could become something of interest.  They may also have invented the tape loop.  The tape loop gave the Barrons sounds rhythm.  They mixed the sounds to create the otherworldly and strange electronic soundscapes required by Forbidden Planet.Recording studioSoon after relocation to New York, the Barrons opened a studio at 9 West 8th Street in Village that catered to the avant-garde scene.( This may have been the very first electronic music studio in America. At the studio, the Barrons used a tape recorder to record everything and everyone.( They recorded Miller, Williams, and Huxley reading their work in a form of early book. In June 1949, Nin recorded a full version of of Incest and four other stories from a Glass Bell. These recordings were pressed on red vinyl and released on the Barrons Contemporary Classics label under the Sound Portraits series. For a short time, the Barrons held a monopoly on tape recording equipment. The only other competition in town were the studios owned by Scott and Siday. The connection through Louis cousin working at 3M proved to be vital in obtaining batches of early tape. Due to the lack of competition in the field, and to the surprise of the owners, the recording business was a success. Aside from the tape recorders, most of the equipment in the studio was completely built by Louis. One of the home made pieces included a monstrous speaker which could produce very heavy bass. oscillators that produced sawtooth, sine, and waves, were also a home built prize possession. They had a filter, a spring reverberator, and several recorders. The thriving business brought in the income to purchase some commercial equipment. The Stancil-Hoffmann to reel was custom built by the inventor for looping the samples and changing their speed.The Barrons music was noticed by the avant-garde scene. During 1952-53 the studio was used by Cage for his very first tape work Mix. The Barrons were hired by Cage to be the engineers. They recorded over 600 different sounds, and arranged them with Cages directions in various ways by splicing the tape together. The four and a half minute piece took over a year to finish.  () Cage also worked in the Barrons studio on his Music for Magnetic Tape with other notable composers, including Feldman, Brown, and Tudor.  It was Cage who first encouraged the Barrons to consider their creations music.Film worksThe Barrons quickly learned that the avant-garde scene did not reap many financial rewards. They turned to Hollywood, which had already been using electronic instruments such as the theremin in film soundtracks for several years.In the early 50s, the Barrons collaborated with various celebrated filmmakers to provide music and effects for films and cinema. The Barrons scored three of Ian Hugos short experimental films based on the writings of his wife Anas Nin. The most notable of these three films were Bells of Atlantis (1952) and Jazz of Lights (1954). The Barrons assisted Deren in the audio production of the soundtrack for The Very Eye of Night (1959), which featured music by Ito. Bridges-Go-Round (1958) by Clarke featured two alternative soundtracks, one by the Barrons and one by jazz musician Macero. The films two versions showed the same four-minute film of York City bridges. Showing the two versions back-to-back showed how different soundtracks affected the viewers perception of the film.  In 1956 the Barrons composed the very first electronic score for a commercial film &ndash; Planet, released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.Forbidden PlanetThe soundtrack for Forbidden Planet (1956) is today recognized as the first entirely electronic score for a film. Eerie and sinister, the soundtrack was unlike anything that audiences had heard before. Music historians have often noted how groundbreaking the soundtrack was in the development of music. On the album sleeve notes of the Forbidden Planet soundtrack, Louis and Bebe explain:We design and construct electronic circuits which function electronically in a manner remarkably similar to the way that lower life-forms function psychologically. . .. In scoring Forbidden Planet &ndash; as in all of our work &ndash; we created individual cybernetics circuits for particular themes and leit motifs, rather than using standard sound generators. Actually, each circuit has a characteristic activity pattern as well as a voice. . .. We were delighted to hear people tell us that the tonalities in Forbidden Planet remind them of what their dreams sound like.The producers of the film had originally wanted to hire Partch to do the music score. The Barrons were brought in to do only about twenty minutes of effects. After the producers heard the initial sample score, the Barrons were assigned an hour and ten minutes of the rest of the film. The studio wanted to move the couple to Hollywood where most of the film scores were produced at the time. But the couple would not budge, and took the work back to their New York studio.The music and the sound effects stunned the audience. During the preview of the movie when the sounds of the spaceship landing on Altair IV filled the theater, the audience broke out in spontaneous applause. Later, the Barrons turned over their stunning audio creation to GNP Crescendo records for distribution. GNP had previously demonstrated its expertise in producing and marketing science fiction film soundtracks and executive album producer Neil Norman had proclaimed the film (and the soundtrack) his favorites.Not everyone was happy with the score. Louis and Bebe did not belong to the Union. The original screen credit for the film, which was supposed to read Electronic Music by Louis and Bebe Barron, was changed at the last moment by a contract lawyer from the Federation of Musicians. In order to not upset the union, the association with the word music had to be removed. The Barrons were credited with Electronic Tonalities. Because of their non-membership in the union, the film was not considered for an Oscar in the soundtrack, or special effects category.Later worksThe full impact of the Barrons contribution can only be realized when one understands that they did not even know what to call their creations.  It was John Cage, working with the Barrons in their studio for his earliest electronic work, who convinced them that it was music.  The Musicians Union forced MGM to title the Forbidden Planet score electronic tonalities, not music.  And seeing the handwriting on the wall, used that excuse to deny them membership in the 1950s;  the unions primary concern was losing jobs for performers rather than the medium itself.  As a result, the Barrons never scored another film for Hollywood. As the years passed, the Barrons did not continue to keep up with technology, and were perfectly content to make their music in the way they always had.  Interestingly though, modern digital technology is now imitating the rich sounds of those old analog circuits.  Bebes last work was Mixed Emotions  in 2000, from raw material collected at the University of California, Santa Barbara studio.( It sounds remarkably like the Barrons trademark classic material.In 1962, the Barrons moved to Angeles. Although they divorced in 1970, they continued to compose together until the death of Louis in 1989. Bebe Barron was the first Secretary of the for Electro-Acoustic Music in the States from 1985 to 1987. In 2000, she was invited to create a new work at of California, Santa Barbara, using the latest in sound generating technology to collect sounds there. From October through early November 2000, she did all the actual composing in Jane Brockmans Santa Monica studio with Brockman serving as recording engineer. The sounds collected at UCSB were imported into Digital Performer on the Mac and organized to create Bebes final work, Mixed Emotions. Bebe Barron remarried in 1975, Louis died in 1989, and Bebe died April 20, 2008.Quotations*music sounds like a molecule that has stubbed its toes. &mdash; From the Diary of Anais Nin, Volume 7 (1966-1974).Works*Heavenly Menagerie (1951-52) Tape*Bells of Atlantis (1952) Film score*For an Electronic Nervous System (1954) Tape*Miramagic (1954) Film score*Forbidden Planet (1956) Videotape; Laserdisc MGM/UA Home Video, 1991; 2-DVD Warner edition, 2006*Jazz of Lights (1956) Film score*Bridges-Go-Round (1958) one of two alternative soundtracks, the other composed by Macero *Crystal Growing (1959) Film score*Music of Tomorrow (1960) Tape*The Computer Age (1968) Film score*Time Machine (1970) on Music from the Soundtrack of Destination Moon and Other Themes, Cinema Records LP-8005*Space Boy (1971) Tape; revised and used for film of same name, 1973*More Than Human (1974) Film score*Cannabis (1975) Film score*The Circe Circuit (1982) Tape*Elegy for a Dying Planet (1982) Tape*New Age Synthesis II on Totally Wired (1986) Pennsylvania Public Radio Associates Cassette Series*Whats the Big Hurry?

K-nearest_neighbor_algorithm
In recognition, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) is a method for classifying objects based on closest training examples in the space. k-NN is a type of learning, or learning where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm is amongst the simplest of all learning algorithms: an object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common amongst its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k  1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of its nearest neighbor. The same method can be used for regression, by simply assigning the property value for the object to be the average of the values of its k nearest neighbors. It can be useful to weight the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones. (A common weighting scheme is to give each neighbor a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor. This scheme is a generalization of linear interpolation.)The neighbors are taken from a set of objects for which the correct classification (or, in the case of regression, the value of the property) is known. This can be thought of as the training set for the algorithm, though no explicit training step is required. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm is sensitive to the local structure of the data.Nearest neighbor rules in effect compute the boundary in an implicit manner. It is also possible to compute the decision boundary itself explicitly, and to do so in an efficient manner so that the computational complexity is a function of the boundary complexity.()Algorithmthumb|right|Example of k-NN classification. The test sample (green circle) should be classified either to the first class of blue squares or to the second class of red triangles. If k  3 it is assigned to the second class because there are 2 triangles and only 1 square inside the inner circle. If k  5 it is assigned to the first class (3 squares vs. 2 triangles inside the outer circle).The training examples are vectors in a multidimensional feature space, each with a class label. The training phase of the algorithm consists only of storing the feature vectors and class labels of the training samples.In the classification phase, k is a user-defined constant, and an unlabelled vector (a query or test point) is classified by assigning the label which is most frequent among the k training samples nearest to that query point.Usually distance is used as the distance metric; however this is only applicable to variables. In cases such as text classification, another metric such as the overlap metric (or distance) can be used. Often, the classification accuracy of k-NN can be improved significantly if the distance metric is learned with specialized algorithms such as Margin Nearest Neighbor or components analysis.A drawback to the basic majority voting classification is that the classes with the more frequent examples tend to dominate the prediction of the new vector, as they tend to come up in the k nearest neighbors when the neighbors are computed due to their large number. One way to overcome this problem is to weight the classification taking into account the distance from the test point to each of its k nearest neighbors.KNN is a special case of a  variable-bandwidth, kernel density balloon estimator with a uniform  kernel.()()Parameter selectionThe best choice of k depends upon the data; generally, larger values of k reduce the effect of noise on the classification, but make boundaries between classes less distinct. A good k can be selected by various heuristic techniques, for example, cross-validation. The special case where the class is predicted to be the class of the closest training sample (i.e. when k  1) is called the nearest neighbor algorithm.The accuracy of the k-NN algorithm can be severely degraded by the presence of noisy or irrelevant features, or if the feature scales are not consistent with their importance. Much research effort has been put into selecting or scaling features to improve classification. A particularly popular approach is the use of algorithms to optimize feature scaling.() Another popular approach is to scale features by the information of the training data with the training classes.In binary (two class) classification problems, it is helpful to choose k to be an odd number as this avoids tied votes. One popular way of choosing the empirically optimal k in this setting is via bootstrap method.()PropertiesThe naive version of the algorithm is easy to implement by computing the distances from the test sample to all stored vectors, but it is computationally intensive, especially when the size of the training set grows. Many neighbor search algorithms have been proposed over the years; these generally seek to reduce the number of distance evaluations actually performed. Using an appropriate neighbor search algorithm makes k-NN computationally tractable even for large data sets.The nearest neighbor algorithm has some strong consistency results. As the amount of data approaches infinity, the algorithm is guaranteed to yield an error rate no worse than twice the error rate (the minimum achievable error rate given the distribution of the data).() k-nearest neighbor is guaranteed to approach the Bayes error rate, for some value of k (where k increases as a function of the number of data points). Various improvements to k-nearest neighbor methods are possible by using proximity graphs.()For estimating continuous variablesThe k-NN algorithm can also be adapted for use in estimating continuous variables. One such implementation uses an inverse distance weighted average of the k-nearest multivariate neighbors. This algorithm functions as follows:# Compute Euclidean or distance from target plot to those that were sampled.# Order samples taking for account calculated distances.# Choose heuristically optimal k nearest neighbor based on RMSE done by cross validation technique.# Calculate an inverse distance weighted average with the k-nearest multivariate neighbors.Using a weighted k-NN also significantly improves the results: the class (or value, in regression problems) of each of the k nearest points is multiplied by a weight proportional to the inverse of the distance between that point and the point for which the class is to be predicted.See also* neighbor search* analysis* (machine learning)* mining* learning* recognition* analytics* reductionReferencesFurther reading* When Is Nearest Neighbor Meaningful? * * * * Fast k nearest neighbor search using GPU.

Shakhty
dateMay 2010Shakhty () is a city in Oblast, Russia, located on the southeastern spur of Donetsk mountain ridge,  northeast of Rostov-on-Don. Its population was 240,152 per the preliminary results of the 2010 Census;( up from 222,592 recorded in the 2002 Census.(HistoryMany hundreds ago in 1805 a sergeant-major Popov founded a small settlement near the river Grushevka. Later it was named Popovka. In 1809 Popov built the first mine. Twelve cossacks and fourteen serf-peasants lived in Popovka at that time. Those serf-peasants were the first miners. In October 3, 1867 as Gornoye Grushevskoye () settlement. From 1881 to 1921, it was called Alexandrovsk-Grushevsky ().By 1914, the population had reached 54,000. The main source of income was mining, which had been carried out in that region since the 18th century. The population was poor, but the town had rail, telegraph and telephone networks, electricity and plumbing as well as libraries, hospitals and a post office. Most of the merchants and industrialists lived in Rostov and Novocherkassk.(shakhty.su: History)1917 saw the city change hands three times, until it was taken on April 28, 1919, by the Army, under General Fitzkhelaurov. For twenty months it was independent of the Bolsheviks, but was ravaged by typhoid.On January 13, 1921 it was finally given its present name. The name Shakhty (mine shafts in English) was chosen, because of the citys association with coal mining. During the 1920s, many of the churches and the archives were destroyed. As with the rest of the Union, the same street names were changed.In July 1942, during the Patriotic War, the town was occupied by the Germans; many coal pits and buildings were blown up by the Germans during their retreat in February, 1943. Twenty-nine of the townsmen were awarded the title of the of the Soviet Union.In 1948, production levels in the mines reached what they had been before the war. During the Brezhnev years, the city was at the height of its development, with a population of over 250,000, and about ten million tons of coal being mined each year.Perestroika proved devastating for the city, as mines were privatized and shut down, causing massive unemployment, which led to a severe rise in crime and drug abuse.Today Shakhty is the main industrial center of the Eastern Donbass.The city is also one of the main producers and exporters of tile in Eastern Europe, Shakhtinskaya Plitka.International relationsTwin towns/sister citiesShakhty is twinned with:* Gelsenkirchen, Germany* BulgariaHistorical conceptsOutside Russia at least, the town is mainly known because of the Trial of 1928, a precursor of the trials of the 1930s, and for being the scene of many of Chikatilos murders.ReferencesExternal links*Shakhty  .  *Official site of the city *Site of partnership Schachty - Gelsenkirchen * ..,  ..

It is best known for the picturesque Rock Lighthouse, one of the most photographed lighthouses in the United States.(  Built by the States Lighthouse Service in 1910, the lighthouse and some adjacent buildings have been restored and the Historical Society operates them as a museum.  The  state park offers a unique cart-in campground and scenic trails for hiking, cross-country skiing, and bicycling.Natural historyGeographySplit Rock Lighthouse State Park encompasses about  of rocky shoreline on Lake Superior with several prominent headlands.  Named features of the shore, from southwest to northeast, are the mouth of the Split Rock River, Split Rock Point, Crazy Bay, Corundum Point, the mouth of Split Rock Creek, Day Hill, Little Two Harbors, Stony Point (site of the lighthouse), and Gold Rock Point.(State of Minnesota, Department of Natural Resources.  Split Rock Lighthouse State Park.  September 2009.  http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/maps/state_parks/spk00266_summer.pdf)  The name Little Two Harbors comes from the division of the inlet by a small island, formerly a tombolo,() and refers to the city of Two Harbors farther down the shore.  There are two shallow caves at the base of Stony Point.()The east and west branches of the Split Rock River, not to be confused with Split Rock Creek, join in the park.  There are ten waterfalls on the river, although because they can only be reached by a moderate hike on the Superior Hiking Trail and are not marked on park maps, they are lightly visited.()GeologyMuch of the shore of Lake Superior is made of basalt erupted from the Rift System when the middle of the  American Plate began to crack 1.1 billion years ago.  In a small tract that includes Split Rock Lighthouse State Park, additional magma intruded into the basalt and cooled underground into a harder rock called diabase.  These flows also carried with them blocks of anorthosite, an even harder rock from the base of the Earths crust, which became interspersed randomly in the diabase.(  Three large blocks of anorthosite form Corundum Point, Day Hill, and Stony Point beneath the lighthouse.  In the southwest portion of the park another eruption formed a layer of red rhyolite.  The rhyolite has eroded into several natural pillars, and forms the walls of the Split Rock River gorge.(()Beginning 2 million years ago a series of periods repeatedly covered the region with ice, scouring the bedrock and scooping out a great basin.()   The glaciers, and later meltwater, wore away less resistant rock, leaving behind hills and ridges of the harder diabase and anorthosite.((  At the end of the glacial period the basin filled with meltwater.  The water level fluctuated significantly over time due to blockages of the outlet and rebound.  The high-water Lake Duluth deposited clay sediments inland, while later, lower precursors of Lake Superior eroded bluffs and beach terraces.(Flora and faunaThe park was originally forested with red and white pine.  However these were heavily logged at the beginning of the 20th Century, and wildfires sweeping through the cutover land killed many of the remaining saplings and seedlings.  Today the vegetation is primarily birch with some spruce, fir, and ash trees.(Mammals found in the park include deer, moose, black bears, raccoons, snowshoe hares, red foxes, bobcats, and lynxes.(  A colony of beavers lives on the Split Rock River.(  Birds include herring gulls, common loons, and a variety of songbirds.(  Peregrine falcons nest on the lakeside cliffs.(Cultural historyEarly historySeveral vestiges of early 20th Century industry are visible in the park.  The first white settlement in the Split Rock area was Little Two Harbors, a commercial fishing village populated largely by Norwegian immigrants.(  The men of the village fished for trout, whitefish, and herring from 16-18 foot skiffs in the fall and winter.(  Little Two Harbors was inhabited until 1925, although in later years only 4 or 5 residents lived there year-round.(  Cement foundations of houses and fish processing buildings remain.(A logging camp known as Splitrock existed at the mouth of the Split Rock River from 1899 to 1906.  Pilings from their dam and wharf are still visible jutting from the water.()  The Merrill Logging Trail follows the route of their  rail line.(  In 1901 a prospector from Duluth misidentified the outcrops of anorthosite as corundum, an extremely hard mineral valuable as an industrial abrasive.  Three years later the North Shore Abrasives Company set up mining operations on Corundum Point, but abandoned the site in 1908 when their product was found to be inadequate.  Their crushing house burned down in a forest fire in 1910 but its concrete footings remain.(Another remnant from this period is a finely crafted, freestanding stone fireplace atop Day Hill.  According to local legend it was the start of a house built around 1900 by Frank Day, a businessman from Duluth, for himself and his sweetheart, but abandoned when she did not reciprocate his love.((Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.  Split Rock Lighthouse State Park interpretive signage.)Split Rock Lighthouse::Main article: Rock LighthouseThree violent storms struck the Great Lakes in November 1905, killing 116 sailors.()  One, the Storm of November 28, damaged nearly 30 ships on Lake Superior.  Two ships were wrecked against the future parks shore, the steel steamboat William Edenborn and a barge it was towing, the Madeira.   The Edenborn was beached far ashore at the mouth of the Split Rock River and later salvaged, but one of the 25 crewmembers was killed.  The Madeira with 10 men aboard drifted northeast until violent waves began smashing her against the cliffs of Gold Rock Point.  Crewman Fred Benson managed to leap onto the rocks and scale the cliff in the midst of the snowstorm.  The first mate was swept overboard and drowned, but Benson was able to lower a rope and pull the other 8 crew to safety.  The Madeira sank in pieces at the foot of Gold Rock while the crewmen, suffering from exposure and frostbite, found shelter with local fishermen and loggers.  Both crews were picked up two days later by the tugboat G.()The shipping companies that had sustained losses in the storms lobbied the federal government for an expanded system of navigational aids on the Great Lakes.  Besides the Edenborn and the Madeira, five other ships had been damaged within a dozen miles of the Split Rock River.( A signal in that area was at the top of the industrys list of demands.  The site ultimately selected for the lighthouse and fog signal was  northeast of the Split Rock River, on Stony Point.  There were no roads yet up the North Shore, so all construction materials were brought in by barge and hoisted up the cliff with a derrick and a steam-powered hoist.  By midsummer 1910 work was complete on the lighthouse, foghorn building, and three houses for the lighthouse keepers.(The derrick remained the only way to bring supplies up the cliff until the lighthouse staff built a tramway in 1915-16.(  The station finally became accessible by a road, now State Highway 61, completed in 1929.  Five years later a crew from the Conservation Corps built a new access road and lighthouse tenders were provided with a truck to bring in supplies by land, so the tramway was dismantled.(  The picturesque lighthouse, perched on a 130 foot cliff overlooking the worlds largest lake, began attracting small numbers of visitors within weeks of its opening.  However the completion of Highway 61 opened the floodgates to tourism.  In 1938 it was estimated that 100,000 visitors stopped by, five times more than any other federally operated lighthouse.(  Some of the lighthouse keepers children opened a souvenir stand just outside the station entrance in 1941.((  Both the U.S. Lighthouse Service and the U.S. Coast Guard which absorbed it in 1939 were obliged to add seasonal staff to help conduct tours.State park creationIn 1945 R. Magney, a former mayor of Duluth turned associate justice of the Supreme Court, noticed a sign near the River reading Lake and River Frontages for Sale.  A staunch advocate of public lands on the North Shore, Magney determined to protect some of this land from the development boom that would accompany the end of World War II.  At this time Gooseberry Falls was the only Minnesota state park on Lake Superior.  A bill promoted by Magney easily passed in the Legislature, creating both Baptism River State Park (now State Park) and Split Rock State Scenic Wayside.  The  wayside consisted of a hill offering a view of the Split Rock Lighthouse.()Due to its popularity with tourists, the lighthouse was kept operating well after radar and other technology had rendered it obsolete.(  However by 1967 the Coast Guard was considering decommissioning the station.  The state legislature acted to expand the wayside into a full-fledged state park including the lighthouse itself.  The station was officially closed in 1969 after 59 years of service.  Under the Property Act the grounds and buildings were transferred to the state of Minnesota for free to be operated as a historic site.((The state parks division developed an entrance station, picnic grounds, roads, and trails.  The Minnesota Historical Society took over management of the lighthouse station in 1976.  Over the next decade they restored several buildings to their 1920 appearance and constructed a $1.2 million history center.  Meanwhile from 1984 to 1990 the state park spent $555,000 to improve the recreational facilities, including a new access road, picnic area, and all-season trail shelter, and an expanded trail system.  They also developed the parks first campground, an unconventional design in which campers wheel their equipment to their sites in carts provided by the park.(The Split Rock Trading Post, just outside of and unaffiliated with the state park, operated from 1960 up to 1999, when it burned down in a fire.  In addition to a kitschy gift shop, this trap once boasted live bears in cages, the anchor of the Madeira, and a wooden tower offering a view of the lighthouse.(Gold Rock Point, the headland just north of the lighthouse, was not originally part of the state park.  In 1997 it was purchased from its private owners by the Parks & Trails Council of Minnesota, an organization founded by Clarence Magney, among others, to buy and hold worthy properties until state legislation can authorize their public acquisition.(Rebuffoni, Dean.  Nonprofit buys tract to expand North Shore state park: plan calls for state to buy 81 scenic acres.  Star Tribune November 8, 1997.)  The next year Blacklock, a nature photographer and president of the Parks and Trails Council, was killed in a car accident just outside the north end of the park.  The Council and the Blacklock Nature Sanctuary, an art and conservation non-profit organization she and her family had founded, jointly purchased  of land around the accident site.    were transferred to the state park while the remainder, with an existing one-bedroom cabin, is managed by the Blacklock Nature Sanctuary as an artists retreat.(Myers, John.  State park gains ground: nonprofit groups will dedicate Split Rock addition, artists sanctuary to famous nature photographer.  Duluth News-Tribune April 13, 2001.)  The additions were developed with access features for Madeira wreck divers and the Gitchi-Gami State Trail, a paved bicycling route in development along the North Shore.RecreationSplit Rock Lighthouse State Park has a unique cart-in campground with 20 secluded campsites and a modern restroom.  Campers leave their vehicles in a parking lot and use two-wheeled carts provided by the park to carry their equipment a short distance to their site.  There are four backpack campsites along the shore, two accessible to sea kayakers. Conventional drive-in campgrounds managed by the state park are available in two state forests in the area.(  An expansion of the state park campground, to include 60 drive-in sites, has been approved and construction may begin in summer 2010.(Expansion plans unveiled for Split Rock State Park.  Duluth News-Tribune October 3, 2009.)The park contains  of trails for hiking, bicycling, and cross-country skiing.  There are several overlooks providing views of the lighthouse and Lake Superior.  A paved section of the State Trail runs through the park near the shore, while the Hiking Trail runs inland and skirts both the Split Rock River and Split Rock Creek.(  There is a lakeshore picnic area and two picnic shelters, one open year-round.(Water recreation includes boating, kayaking, and fishing for trout, salmon, and trout.  The park also provides diving access to the Madeira wreck, which is on the Register of Historic Places.  Divers can also see parts of the Madeira in Little Two Harbors, where they were dumped in 1974 after an aborted salvage operation.(  Underwater artifacts from the settlements of Splitrock and Little Two Harbors can be seen in their respective bays.(ReferencesExternal links* Split Rock Lighthouse State Park* Split Rock Lighthouse State Historic SiteRock Lighthouse State Parkdtat de Split Rock Lighthouse

Its capital, Black River, is located at the mouth of the Black River, the longest on the island.HistorySaint Elizabeth originally included most of the south-west part of the island, but in 1703 Westmoreland was taken from it and in 1814 a part of Manchester. The resulting areas were named after the wife of Sir Thomas Modyford, the first English Governor of Jamaica.There are also traces of Tanos/Arawaks existence in the parish, as well as Spanish settlements. After 1655, when the English settled on the island, they concentrated on planting sugar cane. Today, buildings with Spanish wall (masonry of limestone sand and stone between wooden frames) can still be seen in some areas. St Elizabeth became a prosperous parish and Black River an important seaport. In addition to shipping sugar and molasses, Black River became the centre of the logging trade. Large quantities of logwood were exported to Europe to make a Prussian-blue dye which was very popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Electric power was first introduced in Jamaica in a house called Waterloo in Black River in 1893. GeographyThe parish is located latitude 1815N, and longitude 7756W; to the west of Manchester, the east of Westmoreland, and to the south of St. James and Trelawny. It covers an area of 1212.4 km, making it Jamaicas second-largest parish, behind Saint Anns 1212.6 km. The parish is divided into four electoral districts (constituencies), that is North-East, North-West, South-East and South-West.thumb|left|Lovers Leap, Saint ElizabethThe northern and northeastern parts of the parish are mountainous. There are three mountain ranges &mdash;the Nassau Mountains to the north-east, the Lacovia Mountains to the west of the Nassau Mountains, and the Santa Cruz Mountains which, running south, divide the wide plain to end in a precipitous drop of  at Lovers Leap.  The central and southern sections form an extensive plain divided by the Santa Cruz Mountains. A large part of the lowlands is covered by morass, but it still provides grazing land for horses and mules.The main river in the parish is the Black River, and measuring , it is one of the longest rivers in Jamaica. It is navigable for about , and is supported by many tributaries including Y.S., Broad, Grass and Horse Savannah. The river has its source in the mountains of Manchester where it rises and flows west as the border between Manchester and Trelawny then goes underground. It reappears briefly in several surrounding towns, but reemerges near Balaclava and tumbles down gorges to the plain known as the Savannah, through the Great Morass and to the sea at Black River, the capital of the parish.The geology of the parish is primarily alluvial plains to the south, and karstic limestone to the north. The karstic zones are known to contain over 130 caves (Jamaica Cave Register as of 2007 - from Fincham and JCO). These include Mexico Cave and Wallingford River Cave, near Balaclava, which are two associated sections of a major underground river that has its source in south Trelawny, as well as Yardley Chase Caves near the foot of Lovers Leap, and Peru Cave, near Goshen, which has stalactites and stalagmites. Mineral deposits include bauxite, antimony, white limestone, clay, peat and silica sand which is used to manufacture glass.DemographyThe parish had an estimated population of 148,000 in 2001, 4000 of which live in the capital town. The distinct feature of this parish is that numerous groups can be found there; St Elizabeth probably has the greatest racial mixture in Jamaica. When the Miskito Indians came from America to help track the Maroons in the 18th century they were given land grants in this parish. In the 19th century Irish, Spanish, Portuguese, Scots Germans Chinese and East Indians migrated to Saint Elizabeth, and this accounts for pockets of distinct racial mixtures in the parish including Mulatto and Creole notably found in the southeast.EconomyMiningThe parish has been a major producer of bauxite since the 1960s. Port Kaiser, near a town called Pond, has a leading deep-water pier for bauxite export. The Alpart alumina refinery was constructed in the 1960s at Nain and produces nearly 2 million tonnes of alumina annually for export.  The replacement cost of building the refinery is approximately $2 billion.There are other alumina refineries close to the nearby town of Mandeville.AgricultureApart from bauxite mining, the parish also produces a large quantity of Jamaicas sugar; there are two sugar factories in the parish. Fishing is a major industry in the parish, as is tomato canning; a plant is at Bull Savannah. The parish also cultivates crops such as cassava, corn, peas, beans, pimento, ginger, tobacco, tomato, rice sweet potatoes and coffee. As a result of the fertile soil that provide for grazing fields, pastoralism is possible. Livestock include goats, sheep, hogs, and cattle, horses.TourismSince the 1990s, the parish has become a significant tourist destination, with most visitors going to the Beach area. The Appleton rum distillery, near  Cockpit Country in the north of the parish, is also a tourist destination. Ecological tourism along the Black and YS rivers, and in the Great Morass has been developed in recent years.Education* Elizabeth Technical High School in Santa Cruz* College and Hampton School, both located in the hills of Malvern, boys and girls schools respectively.* River High* Basic School* Primary* High* High* High School in Lacovia* Moravian College* High School in Newmarket* River Primary and Infant School in River* Coke High School in JunctionPlacesBeaches* Hill Beach* Crane* Fullerswood* Parottee* Fort Charles* Bay* Great Bay* Billys Bay* Frenchmans Bay* Beach* Fields BeachTowns and Villages* Accompong, a Maroon village, located in the Country in the north of the parish* Appleton* Arlington* Balaclava* Black River* Bogue* Walk* Carlisle* Cotterwood* Fullerswood* Town* Hodges* Ipswich* Junction* Lacovia, on the Black River* Maggoty* Mountainside* Rose Hall* Santa Cruz* Southfield* St. Pauls* All* Vineyard* Flagaman* Jamaica* Jamaica* Jamaica* Jamaica* JamaicaCavesSt. Elizabeth has approximately 44 caves:* Mexico* Peru Cave* Chase Caves* CavesNainOther Places of Interest* Leap is a cliff plunging several hundred metres into the sea, with an attached romantic legend of two young slaves jumping to their death rather than live apart.(http://www.webcitation.org/query?urlhttp://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Atrium/5460/Introduction/About_Lover_s_Leap/about_lover_s_leap.html&date2009-10-25+09:58:25) There is a lighthouse here too. * Falls is a famous falls in Jamaica, similar to River Falls in Rios, St. Ann.* Bamboo Avenue - was developed in the 17th century when local landowners planted bamboo on both sides of the road to provide shade during their travels.See also* of JamaicaReferencesNotesBibliography*Lovers Leap: Based on the Jamaican Legend, Horane Smith, Minerva Press (June 1, 1999), ISBN 0-7541-0589-XExternal links* Parish Information* Statistical Institute of Jamaica* Political Geography of Jamaica* Mexico Cave - JCO Report* Parishes of Jamaica* StatsElizabeth ParishElizabeth (Jamaika)de Saint Elizabethdi Saint ElizabethElizabeth (Jamaica)ja:Elizabeth prestegjeldElizabethElizabeth

Argentine_Pass
 topo  USGS Grays PeakArgentine Pass, elevation , is a high pass that crosses the Divide in the Range of the Mountains of central Colorado in the States.The highest named vehicle-accessible pass in the state, Argentine Pass is located on the crest of the Range along the boundary between Clear Creek and Summit counties southwest of Georgetown. The pass is flanked by Peak to the west and Peak to the east.  It is traversed by a rugged drive trail, part of which is the grade of the long-abandoned Central Railway.  This trail is passable only on foot or with a modified 4x4 vehicle in good weather during the summer. It is much too rough for regular passenger vehicles and even most stock SUVs.The pass was the location of silver discovery in 1864 that led to the growth of Georgetown as an early center of the silver mining industry in Colorado. The region on the east side of the pass became heavily mined in the following decades, with many remains of mining activity visible today.Note: Vehicle travel is only possible on the Georgetown side, the Horseshoe Basin side may only be traversed by foot or by bicycle.References

Bryn
Bryn (which is Welsh for hill) is a component ward of the Borough of Wigan, in Manchester, England.  It is part of the larger town of Ashton-in-Makerfield and is geographically indistinguishable from it. It forms a separate local council ward. Served by railway station, Bryn is home to the Sisters Recreation Area which has been created from three large tips which remain from Bryns role in Lancashires coal mining past.  The Three Sisters Recreation Area is also the site of the Three Sisters Race Circuit, which provides race driving instruction and plays host to kart racing events and motorcycle road race meetings at clubman level.Bryn (or Brynne) Hall dates from the fourteenth century but has been the seat of the Gerrard family since the thirteenth century or earlier.(Gerrard Family: Gerrard) It was a safe house for the English Roman Catholic martyr and saint Arrowsmith and is reputed to be the burial place of his remains. The Unitarian Park Lane Chapel in Wigan Road was built in 1697, though its congregation was founded in 1662. It is the oldest Non-conformist chapel and congregation in the whole district. By the nineteenth century Park Lane was only one of nine non-conformist chapels in the area.Referencesbr:Brynfr:Brynpl:Bryn

Complex_sales
Complex sales, also known as Enterprise sales, can refer to a method of trading sometimes used by organizations when procuring large contracts for goods and/or services where the customer takes control of the selling process by issuing a for Proposal (RFP) and requiring a proposal response from previously identified or interested suppliers. Complex sales involve long sales cycles with multiple decision makers. Multiple stakeholders and stakeholder groups contribute to every complex sale.  Any product or service may become a complex sale. In some instances a complex sale occurs when the market is mature and the stakes high enough to warrant attention from a variety of stakeholders in the buying organization.  In other instances a complex sales process is needed when the buyer has never had experience with the vendor, technology being sold, or if the solution is business critical or impacts the buying organization on a strategic level.  The series of filters, purchasing steps, and stakeholders involved are designed to reduce the risks associated with making the wrong buying decision.Often the need to have multiple stakeholders or buyers involved relates to the level of risk that is involved in the purchase or sale of goods and/or services.  As the buyer or buying organization if the purchase only impacts a small group of people or component of the buying organization then often the decision is made by one buyer and the process tends to be quite transactional.If the purchase impacts the entire organization, affects the company strategically, or can change the buyer business process then often the sales person is required to have a set of skills that are more in line with a subject matter expert or consultant than a traditional sales person.  This type of sales person can often be referred to as a Key Account Executive or Complex Sales Executive.Large or complex sales opportunities that are international in nature require an additional set of personal and sales skills.  The need for cross-cultural awareness may add an additional layer of complexity in the sales process.The larger the purchase and the buyer risk the more trust and credibility required from the Vendor.  As a Key Account Executive or Complex Sales Executive in addition to product knowledge and selling skills top producing sales executives also have the ability to build strong client relationships and navigate and avoid the political pitfalls within client organizations.Forms of complex sales* Selling consulting engineering services* Enterprise technology sales such as CRM or POS solutions* Commercial insurance sales* Estate development* Large fleet vehicle sales* Mining equipment sales (ie Caterpillar tractors and large tunnel boring machines)* Scientific Solution Sales (Data analysis and management)Sales ControllingDue to the high costs of proposals in complex sales the rate i.e. the percentage of successful offers is a valuable indicator of the performance of the sales force.

Blan
Blan (German: Kupferbergwerk, Hungarian: Balnbnya, Hungarian pronunciation: ) is a town in County, Romania. It has historically been one of Transylvania and Romanias most important centers for copper mining, but its mines are no longer operational. Its Romanian name means blond, the German name means copper mine while the Hungarian name means Baln mine.GeographyIt lies in the Depression (Romanian Depresiunea Ciucului, ).DemographicsAccording to the last census from 2002 it had a population of 7,902 of which 5,121 (64.80%) were Romanians, and 2,703 (34,20%) were Hungarians.(Romanian 2002 Census)HistoryBlan was the site of iron mining during the 17th century, but by 1702 the iron stores had been depleted. The copper deposits were discovered in 1785 by Jnos Opra; production began in 1803, and by 1853 six mines were in operation. From that period, the village gradually began to develop into a town. Until 1967, Blan remained part of the commune of Sndominic, finally gaining official town status in 1968. In 2006 all mining-related activities were stopped by the Romanian government and nowadays the city is counting on ecotourism and small businesses as main economical activities.Points of interestBlans main architectural site is the Roman Catholic Church, consecrated in 1869. Despite the environmental blight of the mining, the surrounding area is uncommonly beautiful, taking in the nearby mountains of Hmaul Mare and Tarcu, the former a popular hiking destination. The river Olt, one of Romanias most significant, originates in the mountains near the town.References(Harghita)(Harghita)(Harghita)hu:Balnbnya(Harghita)pl:Blanpt:Blanro:Blantg:

JapaneseGerman_industrial_co-operation_before_World_War_II
In the years leading up to the outbreak of World War II in Europe in 1939, there was some significant collaborative development in industry between German companies and their Japanese counterparts as part of the two nations evolving relations. This was one major factor in Japans ability quickly to exploit raw materials in the areas of the of Japan that had recently come under their military control.Lurgi group plantsNippon Lurgi Goshi KK was a Japanese company of the period involved in Japanese-German cooperation. The AG German industrial group was a partner, and it was the Lurgi office in Tokyo. The Intelligence Objectives Sub-committee of the United States and United Kingdom later investigated it.()At the beginning of 1942 the Japanese acquired all the low temperature carbonization patents of Lurgi for Japan, Manchuria, and of China. The agreement gave the Japanese the right to construct plants and an exclusive use of patents. A flat payment of approximately 800,000 Reichsmark, was received from the Japanese, this sum being cleared through the German government. One of the aims was oil. For example, the South Sakhalin Mining and Railway Company plant at Naihoro/Oichai in Karafuto perhaps motivated the licensing: the southern Karafuto coal with a content of paraffin tar (about 15%), and low water content, was suitable for hydrogenation.* Mitsui Kosan KK Miiki (Ohmura) operated from about 1939. Lurgi AG installed an carbon plant to operate with the Fischer-Tropsch plant. Coke and gas were produced, the coke ovens being built by Koppers.* The shale plant at Fushun (Japanese Bujum), Manchuria, was perhaps capable of annual production of 200,000 tons of oil. The Japanese Navy also had an interest there in producing some oil and gasoline, in low amounts.* The Manshu Gosei Nenryo plant at Chinchow (Kinshu), was a Fischer-Tropsch plant producing about 30,000 tons per year, online from about 1940.* Near Beijing, in Hopei, the Kalgari factory was to develop the local coal. It could be used also for the Mengjiang coal of the Chahar&ndash;Suiyuan mines.* A planned gasification plant at Rumoe in Hokkaid was apparently not built.* Chosen Sekitan KK at Eian was a small low temperature carbonization plant which was processed about 600 tons of coal per day. This plant yielded from 15,000 to 20,000 tons per annum of tar.With KoppersUbe Yuka Kogya KK (No.2), at Ube was a low temperature carbonization plant, with a synthetic ammonia plant. This was a collaboration with Koppers AG of Essen.Japanese-German military technology collaborationAircraftIt is known that Japan and Germany signed agreements on military technological collaboration, both before the 1939 outbreak of World War II, and during the conflict. However, the first air technology interchange occurred during World War I when Japan joined against Germany on the side of the Allies, and Germany lost a Taube aircraft at Tsingtao, which the Japanese rebuilt as the Isobe Kaizo Rumpler Taube, as well as an LVG, known to the Japanese as the Seishiki-1, in 1916.After the war had ended the Japanese purchased licences for the W.33 which was built as the Yokosho Navy Type Hansa in 1922, and as the Aichi Type 15-ko Mi-go in 1925.During World War II the Japanese Navy traded a E8N Dave reconnaissance seaplane (itself a multi-generational development of the (Vought O2U) to Germany, later seen in British markings on the German raider , and some sources mention the probable dispatch of a Ki-46 Dinah, among other weapons.In the other direction:* The German Focke-Wulf company sent a Fw 190 A-5, and was contracted to send a Fw 200 V-10 (S-1) or Ta 152.* The Heinkel company sent examples of the He 50 A (manufactured in Japan by Aichi as the D1A1, Allied codename Susie), He 70 Blitz, He 112 (V12,12 B-0, Japanese designation A7He1), He 100 D-1 (in Japan designated AXHe1), He 116 (V5/6), and He 118 (DXHe/Yokosuka D4Y Suisei), He 119 V7 and V8, HD 25, HD 62, HD 28, HD 23, He 162 Volksjager, and He 177 A-7 Greif designs.* The Bcker company sent its B 131 Jungmann which in Japan was designated the Kokusai Ki-86 (Army) or Kysh K9W (Navy).* Dornier sent its Do 16 Wal (in Japan made by Kawasaki as the KDN-1), Do N built as the Kawasaki Army Type 87 heavy bomber, and the Do C.* Fieseler sent the Fieseler Fi-103 Reichenberg, and Fi 156 Storch (redesigned by the Japanese and produced as the Te-G).* The Junkers company sent its K 37 (developed by the Japanese as the Ki-1 and Ki-2), G.38b K51 (Japanese design Ki-20), Ju 88 A-1, Ju 52, Ju 87 A, Ju 86 and made sales of its Ju 290, Ju 390 and Ju 488 designs.* The Messerschmitt company sold the Bf 109 E-3/4, Me 110, Me 210 A-2, Me 163 A/B Komet (a Japanese design based only on the partial drawings received was the J8M/Ki-202 Shusui rocket interceptor) and Me 262 A-1a whose design influenced the Ki-201 Karyu; and studied the possibility of the use of the Me 264. Also sent was the design of the Me 509, which may have influenced the design of the R2Y1 Keiun reconnaissance plane.* The Arado company sent(?) an example of Ar 196 A-4, which had been traded for the E8N.* Focke-Achgelis sent its design Fa 330 Bachstelze, an observation aircraft for submarines, and other aircraft examples.When it came to aircraft equipment, the Japanese Army fighter Ki-61 Hien (Tony) used a licence-built DB 601A engine which resulted in the Allies believing that it was either a Bf 109 or an Italian C.202 Folgore until they examined captured examples. It was also fitted with Mauser MG 151/20 20 mm cannons also built under licence.RocketsAccording to decrypted messages from the Japanese embassy in Germany, twelve dismantled V-2 (A-4) rockets were shipped to Japan. These left Bordeaux in August 1944 on the transport U-boats U-219 and U-195, which reached Djakarta in December 1944. A civilian V-2 expert was a passenger on U-234, bound for Japan in May 1945 when the war ended in Europe. The fate of these V-2 rockets is unknown.VehiclesThere are other cases of military technology interchange. The Ho-Ru SPG with 47 mm AT cannon, resembled the German Hetzer destroyer combined with wheel guide pins like the T-34. The heavy tank destroyers Ho-Ri I and II, armed with a 105 mm cannon, seem to have been influenced by German Jagd heavy tanks Elefant and Jagdtiger. The 4 Chi-To medium tank, armed with a 75 mm cannon, and the 5 Chi-Ri medium tank, armed with 75 or 88 mm cannon, were influenced by the Panther, I, and II German tanks. The 1 Ho-Ha half-track personnel carrier was similar to the German 251 fighting vehicle.Japanese Ambassador General shima in the name of Japanese Army bought one example of the Panzerkampfwagen PzKpfw VI Ausf E Tiger I tank with additional equipment.SubmarinesThe Japanese Navy received examples of the German Type IXD2 submarine Ausf Monsun and other submarines, such as the Type IXD2s  (Japanese submarine I-501) and  (I-502), the  (I-503), and Reginaldo Giuliani (I-504), the Type X submarine  (I-505), the Type IXD1   (I-506), two Type IXC submarines (RO-500 & RO-501), and Flakvierling anti-aircraft cannons, with a disarmed V-2, etc.Japanese Navy received later in last war stages from Germans, some advanced technology of Type XXI Elektro-boote class for designed The Sen Taka (submarine, high speed) and Sen Taka Sho (submarine, high speed, small) models, in high bursts of speed, could run faster submerged than on the surface for up to an hour, only comparable in underwater speed to the I-201 class was the German related sub type.ShipsIn 1935 a German technical mission arrived in Japan to sign accords and licenses to use the technology from the -class carrier for use in the German aircraft carriers  and B (both later cancelled) from Werke Kiel A.G. They also acquired the technical data on the adaptations to the Me 109T/E and Ju 87C/E, for use on such carriers. This technology was also applied in the following aircraft:*Fi 156*Fi 167*Ar 95/195*Ar 96B*Ar 197*He 50*Avia B 534. IVOther military technology collaborationsTo put this in perspective, the Japanese also bought licences and acquired aircraft (sometimes singly and sometimes in large quantities) from most of the western countries. These included the United Kingdom (with which it had a close relationship up until shortly after the end of World War I) and whose Havilland aircraft were extensively used, France, who supplied a huge variety of aircraft of all types from 1917 through to the 1930s, and whose NiD 29 fighter provided the Army Air Force with its first modern fighter aircraft, as well as the bias toward extremely manoeuvrable aircraft. The United States of America supplied the Douglas DC-4E and DC-5, the American NA-16 (precursor to the T-6/SNJ) as well as others too many to list. This resulted in many Japanese aircraft being discounted as being copies of western designs - which from 1935 onwards was rarely the case except for trainers and light transports where development could be accelerated, the Ki-201 and J8M being rare exceptions.Later developmentsBy 1944, Japan was to rely heavily on the Nippon-German Technical Exchange Agreement, obtaining manufacturing rights, intelligence, blueprints, and in some cases, actual airframes for several of Germanys new air weapons. These included the Me 163 Komet (developed as the J8M Shusui), the 003 axial-flow jet engine (which was reworked to Japanese standards as the Ne-20), information on the Me 262 which resulted in the Nakajima J9Y Kikka), data on the Fiesler Fi-103R series (which culminated in the development of the Baika), and even data on the Ba 349 Natter point-defense interceptor.Nakajima J9YWhile the Nakajima Kikka bore some resemblance to the German Me 262, it was only superficial, even though the Ne-20 engines which powered the Kikka were the Japanese equivalent of the German BMW 003 engine which initially powered the Me 262 prototype. Also, the Kikka was envisioned from the outset not as a fighter, but as a special attack bomber and was only armed with a bomb payload.Tachikawa Ki-162The Japanese became involved in the He 162 just before Germanys surrender in 1945. It seems that the Japanese were sent data concerning the He 162 not by submarine or courier, but by wire transmission. This transfer occurred in April 1945. What was sent is not known, but certainly could not have been useful in the absence of any form of blueprints, technical drawings, or other more solid data needed to produce such an aircraft. If the Japanese acquired illustrations or pictures of the He 162 from some source and perhaps from the data obtained from the transmissions, could have produced something from it, much as they did the Ne-20 from photographs of the BMW 003 turbojet. If dimensions of the He 162 were sent, it is probable Japanese engineers could have replicated the appearance of the He 162 and either equipped it with the later Ne-330 engine or the Maru pulsejets. Certainly the He 162 lent itself to the use of non-war critical materials in its construction and was relatively simple to assemble and build, all things the Japanese were capable of doing. As it was, with the situation the Japanese air industry found itself in by this time, the task of producing a new aircraft from such sketchy data would have taken more effort than could be spared.See also* shale in ChinaReferencesExternal links* On Japans oil industry, USAAF perspective* German-Japanese aircraft technology interchange list

Swinton,_Greater_Manchester
SESwinton is a town within the of Salford, in Manchester, England.() It stands on gently sloping ground on the southwest side of the Irwell, and within the bounds of the orbital motorway. It is  west-northwest of Salford, and  west-northwest of Manchester. Swinton and the adjoining town of Pendlebury together have a population of 41,347.()Historically a part of Lancashire, for centuries Swinton was a small hamlet within the township of Worsley, parish of Eccles and hundred of Salfordshire.(.) This hamlet is thought to have centred around an ancient pig farm or market; the name Swinton is derived from the English Swynton meaning swine town.( During the Middle Ages Swinton was broadly held by the religious orders of the Hospitaller and Abbey. Farming was the main industry of this rural area during the Middle Ages, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the system.(Measures underlie the area, and a series of collieries opened during the Revolution gave rise to Swinton as an important industrial area. Locally sourced coal provided the fuel for a variety of cotton spinning and brickmaking industries. Bricks from Swinton were used for the 3rd Duke of Bridgewaters ambitious industrial projects, including the Canal, which passes Swinton to the south. The adoption of the system facilitated a process of unplanned urbanisation in the area, and by the mid-19th century Swinton had emerged as an important town and mining district at a convergence of factories, brickworks and a newly constructed road and railway network.(.)Following the Government Act 1894, Swinton was united with neighbouring Pendlebury to become an district of Lancashire. and Pendlebury received a charter of incorporation in 1934, giving it honorific borough status. In the same year, the United Kingdoms first purpose-built intercity highwaythe major road, which terminates at Swintons southern boundarywas officially opened by King George V.() Swinton and Pendlebury became part of the City of Salford in 1974. As such, Swinton has continued to grow as the seat of Salford City Council and as a town, supported by its transport network and close proximity to city centre.HistoryThe name Swinton is said to derive from pig-rearing - an early form was Swynton (Swine Town).()During the Middle Ages, Swinton belonged to Abbey. Later, lands at Swinton were granted to Thurston Tyldesley, then of  Wardley Hall. Documents record that certain areas belonged to the Hospitaller.In 1817 some Swinton weavers joined in the Blanketeer demonstration and marched to London to put their grievances to the Prince Regent. In 1842 some Swinton people took part in Chartist agitations and tried to destroy a local colliery.Sunday schools and libraries were established in Swinton at quite an early period. An Industrial School was visited by Dickens. The school opened in 1843 and survived until the 1920s. During demolition of the school buildings in the early thirties, the foundations proved particularly difficult. Finally explosives were used, which resulted in a huge number of rats being disturbed. It was a number of weeks before council workers were able to remove the rats from the surrounding streets and houses. Huge nests of baby rats were carried out of the rafters of many buildings.  The site was used for the present Town Hall.GovernanceImage:Swinton and Pendlebury Council - coat of arms.PNG|thumb|right|The of arms of the former and Pendlebury Municipal Borough Council, granted by the of Arms 1 October 1934.()Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century, Swinton anciently formed part of the hundred of Salford for civil jurisdiction.

Before its construction, council meetings were held in Victoria House in Victoria Park but the Council required larger premises.  A competition was launched to design the new hall, the winners were Welsh architect Sir Percy Thomas and Ernest Prestwich with a design that closely resembled Swansea Guildhall.The site of the former school on Chorley Road was purchased for 12,500 and the foundation stone of the new town hall laid on 17 October 1936. The main builders were J Gerrards and Son of Pendlebury. The town hall opened on 17 September 1938. Extensions were built when it became the administrative headquarters of the of Salford in 1974.It was once reported that Swinton had the greatest number of chip shops per capita in Britain.( )Wardley Hall is an early medieval house and a Grade I building which is the official residence of the Roman Catholic bishops of Salford.()SportsLions RLFC has an impressive record in league considering the size of the town.

Pretenders_(Transformers)
Pretenders is a subline within the Transformers toy line, introduced in 1988. The concept behind the toy was that the Transformers were capable of disguising their robotic forms through the use of synthetic organic outer shells.()Transformers: Generation 1Standard Pretenders (1988)AutobotsCloudburst*Cloudburst (spacecraft) (in Japan released as Phoenix)Groundbreaker*Groundbreaker (rocket car; exclusive to America)Landmine*Landmine (mining vehicle) (in Japan released as Lander)Metalhawk*Metalhawk (jet; exclusive to Japan)Sky High*Sky High (helicopter; exclusive to North America)Splashdown*Splashdown (hovercraft; exclusive to North America)Waverider*Waverider (bathyscaphe) (in Japan released as Diver)DecepticonsWhile the Autobots outer shells all resemble human beings clad in armor, the Decepticons shells are all in the form of monstrous animalistic creatures.(Marvel graphic novels and related publications: an annotated guide, page 92 by Robert G. Weiner) The robot figure is contained entirely within the shell, invisible to the outsider observer. After the shell splits apart to release it, the shell can be recombined for a second figure. Although the first set of Pretenders was released early in 1988, a second set of 6, exclusive to North America, was also sold. Metalhawk, named so because his inner robot was constructed partially of die-cast metal (a rarity in 1988), was only sold in Japan.Bomb-BurstBomb-Burst is Decepticon Pretender, released as a toy in 1988.  His tech-spec profile describes him as a vampire who swoops down on his enemies and uses his serrated metallic fangs to drain their fuel. His Pretender shell has a special texture that causes a rust rash on contact. The shell is the form of a humanoid bat, which can be blinded by bright sunlight and is armed with a corrosive slime shooter and armor-piercing battle axe.  The inner robot transforms into a vertical take-off and landing hover jet with dual lasers.()He is considered the closest thing Transformers have to vampire.()Toys*Generation 1 Pretender Bomb-Burst (1988):This Decepticon Pretender came with a shell shaped like a vampire bat humanoid.() This toy is identical to the toy released as Blood in Japan.Bugly*Bugly (jet; exclusive to North America)Finback*Finback (hovercraft; exclusive to North America)Iguanus*Iguanus (motorcycle; exclusive to North America)SkullgrinLike several other Pretenders, Skullgrins personality changed somewhat when he received his Pretender shell. Normally a cool, calculating combatant, inside the shell he becomes a rampaging engine of destruction that tries to destroy everything in his path, never retreating. It has been speculated that the shell has a personality of its own.  However, the egotistical Skullgrin has a surprising personality quirk  he loves Earth and is fascinated by it. Making him very different from other Decepticons. In his affair with Circuit-Breaker, he actually bargained for fuel instead of fighting to avoid any casualties.Skullgrins Pretender shell is easily distinguishable by having the skull of a bovine animal for a head. The shells dark gray color, multiple spikes, and skull ornaments on its belt give it a menacing appearance, similar to Death. The inner Skullgrin robot transforms into a Cybertronian tank.(Transformers Universe Supplementary Archive)Toys*Generation 1 Pretender Skullgrin (1988):This toy is identical to the toy sold in Japan as Dauros.()*Generations Deluxe Skullgrin (2010):A remold of Generations Darkmount.(TFW2005.com - BotCon 2010 Hasbro Designers Panel)SubmarauderAs silent and mysterious as the ocean depths.

He is equipped with a cuncussion blaster in robot mode.(http://www.tfu.info.com) Also he has a backpack. Stranglehold is all brawn - no brain. He has a brawn blaster that can drain down his enemies power. Octopunch, Starscream and Bludgeon are alike Stranglehold.()Pretender Classics (1989)Decepticon*Starscream (F-15 Eagle)Autobots*Jazz (Porsche)*Bumblebee (Volkswagen Beetle)*Grimlock (Tyrannosaurus rex)Four classic characters, re-imagined as Pretenders. All four have humanoid shells. The inner robots were also sold without their shells as part of the K-Mart exclusive K-Mart Legends line.Mega Pretenders (1989)Autobots*Vroom (car, motorbike w/sidecar) () Vroom was named the 21st top unfortunately named Transformer by Topless Robots.()*Crossblades (jet/dragster, helicopter)Decepticon*Thunderwing (small jet, large jet/spacecraft)The Mega Pretenders kicked the Pretender concept up a notch, giving both the interior robot and the shell the ability to transform and combine to form a larger vehicle.Crossblades and Thunderwing were retooled and recolored in Japan and were sold as Blue Bacchus and Black Shadow respectively.Ultra Pretenders (1989)Autobot*Skyhammer (VTOL jet/jet/funny car)Decepticon*Roadblock (tank/jet/half track tank)Taking the Pretender concept to the extreme, the Ultra Pretenders featured two shells  a large exterior vehicle shell, which then contained a secondary humanoid shell (which could also transform), and within that, finally, the diminutive interior robot. Roadblock is a notable sufferer of gold plastic syndrome  gold plastic is known for deteriorating faster than other colors, and the inner robot is made mostly of this material, making it is hard to find an intact Roadblock.Decepticon Monster Pretenders (1989)*Icepick (monster; exclusive to North America)*Birdbrain (monster; exclusive to North America)*Bristleback (monster; exclusive to North America)*Slog (monster; exclusive to North America)*Scowl (monster; exclusive to North America)*Wildfly (monster; exclusive to North America)These six figures were unique among the Pretenders  small robots with monster alternate modes, housed within shells made from soft rubber. Together, the six interior robots could combine into Monstructor. This set was sold in Japan as Dinoforce, where the inner robots were recolored and had soft rubber dinosaur shells instead of monster shells.Marvel ComicsWith the North American Transformers cartoon having come to a conclusion the previous year, it fell to Comics to provide the supporting fiction for Pretenders in the West.Attempting to maximize his warriors power of disguise and surprise, the Decepticon commander Scorponok conceived a method of merging sythoplasm  a synthetic organic substitute  with six of his warriors, creating the Decepticon Pretenders. A computerized version of Prime had spied on the process, however, allowing the Autobots to duplicate it in time to meet the Decepticon attack with their own Pretenders. But while the Autobots were well aware of the true nature of their opponents, the dim-witted Decepticons at first thought they were merely fighting particularly tall humans, giving the Autobots the element of surprise when they split from their shells and forced the Decepticons back. Both factions used their shells and inner forms simultaneously and separately in combat, splitting their concentration to double their effective fighting force. This tactic was seen again and again in subsequent stories involving the Pretenders.Later, the Decepticon Skullgrin underwent a brief stint as a movie star, using his shell to play the role of a monster, until he was attacked by Circuit Breaker.When Starscream attained the power of the Underbase, the Pretenders were among the Transformers able to survive his onslaught due to their organic components. Seeking to bolster his forces, Scorponok contacted Carnivac, Catilla and Snarler  three Decepticons left on Earth after the reality-shredding Time Wars  and gifted them with Pretender shells in exchange for their attacking Maximus. Although they failed, they were allowed to keep their shells, and subsequently encountered Springer and the other Autobot Time Wars survivors. Catilla joined the Autobots outright, while Carnivac sided with them but remained a Decepticon in name, leaving Snarler disgusted and vowing to make them pay. Snarler assembled a new Attack Squad  including the Pretenders Bludgeon, Stranglehold and Octopunch  and attacked the survivors in a battle that saw Bludgeon kill Catilla.Not long after, Landmine and Cloudburst were sent on a mission to acquire new parts to repair the fallen Autobots, only to run afoul of the dealers of said parts, the robot-eating Mecannibals. Chosen by the Mecannibals to be their next meal, Cloudburst stayed their consumption by convincing the Mecannibals to allow them to acquire an additional ingredient that would make them tastier to eat, retrieving it from the nearby planet of Femax. There, Cloudburst so impressed the female warrior chieftain that she sought to make him her mate, only to decapitate him in rage upon discovering that he was a robot within his shell. Landmine was able to placate her, and Cloudburst was repaired; as they left the planet, they discovered that the Decepticons Dreadwind and Darkwing had been responsible for the Mecannibals discovering their true nature, and were able to escape the monsters clutches while they set off to make their robot-spotters the Mecannibals next meal.Escaping the Mecannibals for a brief time, Dreadwind and Darkwing were sent on a mission by Megatron to recover Starscreams corpse. Megatron then captured Ratchet, teleporting him  and, accidentally, the deactivated bodies of Grimlock, Jazz and Bumblebee  to Cybertron, where he forced him to rebuild Starscream as a Pretender, who he then unleashed on the Autobots and Decepticons on Earth. Ratchet was able to use the discard prototype Pretender shells to revive Grimlock, Jazz and Bumblebee, and defeated Megatrons plan. While Starscream got to grips with his new situation  feeling that the Decepticons considered him a walking joke, when in actuality, they were terrified of him  the Mayhem Attack Squad Pretenders were sent to attack Grimlock and co. on the orders of the Decepticons new Cybertronian commander, Thunderwing, a Pretender himself. Four UK strips showed how Thunderwing became commander; but no explanation was given for where Thunderwing acquired his Pretender shell, and he was only shown without it in one panel in The Big Shutdown. This would confuse the issue of the origin of the Pretender shells further, as illustrations for the text story, The Magnificent Six, would show Thunderwing with his shell as a lieutenant of Megadeath before the Ark crashed on Earth.When the quest to recover the Autobots lost Creation Matrix began, Autobot Pretenders Longtooth, Pincher and Doubleheader tracked a lead to the planet of Pequod, discovering that the last of an extinct race of sea-mammals named the klud had been revived by Matrix energy. Longtooth was attacked by the creature, and then, his injuries addling his mind, set out to kill it in an Ahab-like quest, only to be stopped by his allies. The Pretender Classics then located the Matrix on a moon of the planet Cameroon, but Thunderwing stole it and was possessed by it, attacking the Autobots until he was defeated by being jettisoned into space. It was here for the first time that a liability inherent in using a Pretender outer shell separately in combat was shown; Thunderwing blew a large hole straight through Bumblebees Pretender shell, and, though nowhere near the blast, Bumblebees inner form was crippled by the feedback.Thunderwing later returned during Unicrons attack on Cybertron, but was destroyed by the Chaos-Bringer, allowing Optimus Prime to use the Matrix to save the day, at the cost of his own life. Grimlock was appointed new Autobot leader, and lost his Pretender abilities when exposure to Nucleon robbed him of being able to transform, turning him into an Action Master.Octopunch would appear among the troops of Bludgeon attacking the planet Klo in issue #80, The End of the Road! Although they were winning against the Autobots, the arrival of Optimus Prime and The Last Autobot turned the tide and the Decepticons retreated.Bludgeon, meanwhile, became new Decepticon leader for several years, until Megatron returned and battled him, decapitating his outer shell and then destroying his interior robot (as seen in Generation 2).In the Rhythms Of Darkness alternate 2009, the Monsters are lackeys of Galvatron, while Chainclaw is one of the few surviving Autobots.Pincher and Doubleheader appeared in Marvel U.K. Transformers #251 The Void! where they were among the Autobot crew of a ship commanded by Prime which was retreating from Cybertron.Dreamwave ProductionsWhile the Pretenders received profiles in Productions More Than Meets the Eye series, only a few Pretenders were actually featured in any Dreamwave stories. Bludgeon and Bugly were both part of the Trinity, along with Mindwipe, and helped procure subjects for The Fallens plans in the second volume of The War Within, known as The Dark Ages. They were eventually defeated by a combined force of Autobots and Decepticons.Alternate universe versions of Bludgeon and Thunderwing, as well as Scourge, Dirge and Galvatron were among the of Unicron in the final story arc of Dreamwaves Armada series, sent to soften the Armada universe for Unicrons arrival. However, Armada Megatron defeated Galvatron with the help of the Saber and the others were blown up by the Autobots.The Dreamwave Transfomers Universe book also gave the first ever information/description on Monstructor, the combine form of the Pretenders Monsters. Monstuctor is described as an Lovecraftian-type abomination that was divided into five separate, and weaker, robots to stop its quest to destroy all life within universe by unknown forces.IDW PublishingIn the Publishing miniseries Transformers: Stormbringer, the Pretender process, called bio-cybernetic grafting, was invented by Thunderwing in his attempts to allow Transformers to survive Cybertrons deterioration. Pretender shells are made from bodily tissue culled from living beings, which led Megatron to decry the process as an abomination and decommission it which was a surprising act for Megatron, who was known to take virtually any advantage he could get in the war with the Autobots, causing Thunderwing to go rogue to prove it worked. The process inadvertently turns the subject into a supremely powerful maniac, more force of nature than sentient being, and Thunderwings initial rampage made Cybertron uninhabitable. A cult of Decepticons under Bludgeon, comprising Bomb-Burst, Skullgrin, Finback and Iguanus, brought Thunderwing back online in 2006, in an attempt to rejuvenate Cybertron by the sacrifice of inhabited planets. They were intending to undergo the grafting process themselves, but the Wreckers terminated most of the group before this could happen; Bludgeon underwent the process too soon and it went wrong, destroying his mind in a psychic backlash.()The robot forms of Bludgeons group are drawn substantially different from the robot forms of their toys, and resemble the designs of their Pretender shells. Bludgeons Pretender shell was redesigned to be that of a transformable Mega-Pretender. Also, Thunderwing was given a secondary attack mode where his jet wings folded in and his body extended, making him a giant among the other Transformers.Monstructor made his debut in Transformers: Spotlight issue on Prime, however his components were neither Pretenders nor Decepticons, as they were imprisoned before factions or the Pretender process existed.()Devils Due PublishingThe concept of Pretender shells was given another new origin in Due Publishings fourth G.I. Joe vs the Transformers series. Here, Bludgeon and the future Pretender Monsters came to Earth to exploit it, but were shot down. To survive, they made a deal with the serpent cult Cobra-La to work for them. However, Cobra-Las aversion to mechanical technology would mean that they took organic shells out of necessity, being adjusted for Cobra-Las purposes. Unlike IDWs re-imagining of Pretenders, the Pretenders seen here resemble the traditional look of their Pretender toys.Pretenders in JapanNot all of the Pretender toys released in the West reached Japan, and several of those that did were either renamed or remolded in some way.1988Autobots*Lander (Landmine)*Phoenix (Cloudburst)*Diver (Waverider)Decepticons*Blood (Bomb-Burst)*Dauros (Skullgrin)*Gilmer (Submarauder)Additionally, one entirely new Autobot Pretender figure was created for this year  Metalhawk, so named for the large amount of die-cast metal in his interior robot, which transformed into a jet.Also, this year saw the release of a recolored version of the original Maximus toy named Grand Maximus. His Headmaster component, Grand, was outfitted with a newly-created Pretender shell. Grand is a recolored version of Fortress Maximuss component, Cerebros.In addition, Japan did not receive the following Pretenders:Autobots*Groundbreaker*Sky High*SplashdownDecepticons*Iguanus*Finback*Bugly1989This year saw only Decepticon Pretenders released, all sufficiently colored differently from their American cousins.DinoforceThe Japanese version of Americas Pretender Monsters, these toys were colored in creams, blacks and greens, and were given entirely different shells in the images of cyborg dinosaurs. Their combined form is Dinoking. They included:*Goryu (redeco of Icepick; T. rex)*Gairyu (redeco of Bristleback; Ankylosaurus)*Doryu (redeco of Scowl; Stegosaurus)*Kakuryu (redeco of Slog; Triceratops)*Yokuryu (redeco of Wildfly; Pteranodon)*Rairyu (redeco of Birdbrain; Apatosaurus)CrossformersThe Crossformers are versions of Americas Mega Pretenders that have names based on their base colors, and shells that appear to be remolded variants of the American Mega Pretender shells. It is possible they may have been released earlier than the Mega Pretenders (1989) because while both share the same decals as the American versions, the frames of each label matches the color of the place it sat on each Crossformer. (For example, while Thunderwing has lavender wings and Black Shadow has red ones, the edges of the labels are red.)*Bacchus (remold/redeco of Crossblades)*Black Shadow (remold/redeco of Thunderwing)Super God MasterforceThe cancellation of the American Transformers cartoon series had not deterred Japan  in 1987, they produced their first exclusive Transformers series, The Headmasters, and did the same in 1988 with Super-God Masterforce, starring the Pretenders.Eight thousand years ago, a starship containing the Autobot Pretenders Metalhawk, Lander, Diver and Phoenix pursued the Decepticon Pretenders Blood, Dauros and Gilmer to Neolithic-era Earth, where they crashed. Using their Pretender abilities, the Autobots adopted the form of humans - not using simple external shells like in the American fiction, but actually transforming the very structure of their bodies into an organic equivalent, shrinking down to normal human size to hide in plain sight among burgeoning humanity. The Decepticon Pretenders, on the other hand, adopted the forms of monstrous creatures, becoming feared as demons by early man. After many battles, the Autobots succeeded in defeating their enemies and sealing them away for thousands of years  Blood in the pyramids of Egypt, Gilmer in the ruins of Atlantis, and Dauros beneath the Lines in Peru.Liberated in the near future by the mysterious Decepticon god, Z, the three Pretenders entered his service, and immediately began to draw the Autobot Pretenders out of hiding, before turning their attention to a series of plans of acquiring energy and disrupting one of the three Chokoon Powers on Earth. After a string of failures, Devil Z supplanted them with his more powerful Godmaster minions, and although they would often participate in missions, their standing was downgraded and their regularity of appearance on the battlefield diminished. Eventually, they generally only served to supply comic relief, and departed Earth with the other surviving Decepticons when Devil Z was destroyed.VictoryThe Pretenders made a return of sorts in Victory, with the Decepticon DinoForce, a group of Pretenders with outer shells resembling dinosaurs. they were used by Deszaras primarily for their ability to combine into Dinoking. Oddly, the shells were shown to be sentient, able to act and think for themselves when their hosts werent around. Also, the shells were fully transformable even though the Dinoforce themselves were never shown to transform.Transformers: Revenge of the FallenA Pretender appears in Revenge of the Fallen as a machine posing as a human named Alice, played by Lucas.(http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/transformers-movie-toys--products-30/transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-news-from-uk-toy-fair-166702/)Unlike most Transformers who adopt obviously mechanical alternate forms for disguise, Alice takes the form of an animatronic figure of Alice From in Wonderland from an amusement park, and therefore is able to pass as human. This interpretation of Pretenders is closer to the Japanese Pretenders from Transformers: Generation 1, such as in the Masterforce anime, who actually turned into humans instead of wearing organic-looking shells over robot bodies, as was their depiction in the U.S.One of the earliest scenes caught on camera during the production of Revenge of the Fallen was a puppet of Alice in robot mode attacking the car as Mikaela, Sam and Leo made their escape. Initial fan reactions lead many to think this was Frenzy from the last film returning.(http://www.youtube.com/watch?vH2xPbUk_rEI&featureplayer_embedded)The special effects used to create Alice were done by Domain, which used no screen or capture in its work.(http://www.vizworld.com/2009/07/digital-domain-turns-alice-into-a-decepticon/ Digital Domain turns Alice into a Decepticon)Alice was voted one of the All-Time Hottest Robots by Techland in April 2010.(http://techland.com/2010/04/20/sci-fi-sexy-time-all-time-hottest-robots/ Sci-Fi Sexy Time: All-Time Hottest Robots By Allie Townsend on April 20, 2010)Isabelle Lucas was recognized for her breakout performance as Alice at Spike TVs Scream 2009 awards, which was reported by the Associated Press.(http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2009-10-18-scream-2009_N.htm Depp, Richards light up Spike TVs Scream 2009, By Sandy Cohen, Associated Press)ReceptionAlice was picked as the 73rd Coolest Movie Robot by Matt Patches of UGO.com.()IDW PublishingIn the comic adaption of Revenge of the Fallen, it is mentioned that Alice took her form and name by scanning an animatronic Alice in Wonderland from an park.Alice appears in Nefarious #1, set months after the events of the 2009 film. She steals an RV in Seattle and is chased by Skids and Mudflap, who keep her occupied until Sideswipe arrives and defeats her. She is taken to NEST headquarters on Garcia to be examined by Ratchet. Sideswipe is disgusted by her decision to disguise herself as a human.BooksThe novel adaption of Revenge of the Fallen has an identical origin to the comic.Movie plotPosing as a college student to track Sam down and keep an eye on him, Alice overtly flirts with him at a party and later in his room after he has been revealed as able to write symbols in Cybertronian. Later on, she is revealed to be a Decepticon with a whip-like tongue. She chases Sam, Mikaela and Leo, but is killed when Mikaela crushes her against a light pole with a car and then runs over her to finish the job.References()

Central_Technical_School
superintendentPeter ChangCentral Technical School (C.T.S.) is a composite high school located at 725 Bathurst Street at Harbord Street in Toronto, Canada.C.T.S. offers a wide range of programs, including all core academic courses, as well as concentration and specialization in visual arts and technical studies.  C.T.S. also offers enriched levels and special education, including resource room and monitoring for students who have been identified as having learning disabilities, and support for students in the transition from high school to university, college, apprenticeship or employment.HistoryAt the turn of the century, the northern and western limits of the City of Toronto intersected approximately at the corner of Bloor and Spadina. It was here that the horse-drawn trolleys of the Toronto Street Railway turned off Bloor Street and made their way south towards the lakefront. Suburbia began at Spadina, and slightly to the west, where Central Tech now stands was a large apple orchard owned by members of the Saywell family. As more people moved to the suburbs part of this orchard was purchased by the Board of Education and it became the site of Borden St. public school. The fact that the Board already owned this property was largely responsible for its choice as the site of the Toronto Technical School when construction of this school was finally approved.Actually, the main building of our present complex was the fourth home of the Toronto Technical School. As early as 1888, the Association of Stationary Engineers had requested the City Council to consider the establishment of a school for technical training to meet the need for skilled workers for Torontos booming industries. There followed a certain amount of political buck passing in which the Council tried to shift the responsibility for founding such a school to the Board of Management of the Public Library. The Library Board investigated the whole picture of technical education on this continent and reported that the need for such a school was obvious, but that to be effective, it should be on a much larger scale than originally contemplated by Council. They recommended that a special committee be set up to blueprint the organization and management of the proposed institution. Finally, in 1891, Council passed a motion to establish The Toronto Technical School to be located in the Lawrence Hall and the anterooms connected therein. The school mainly catered to older students with the classes being held in the evenings so that employees could attend after work. Classes began on January 26, 1892, and were held from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. each public school day.  Provision was made for a total of 150 students studying mathematics, chemistry, descriptive geometry, mechanics, physics, and drafting. Unfortunately, 307 students registered and it was soon apparent that the Lawrence Hall was totally inadequate, so the school moved the more spacious Old Wycliffe Hall on the north side of College St. at the head of McCaul St., the present site of the Mining Building of the of Toronto.By 1896, the enrollment had risen to 1,511. Courses in Domestic Science were introduced in that year and the school became coeducational. The overcrowding led to many complaints by interested organizations who demanded that a suitable building be provided for the Toronto Technical School . A harassed city council finally appointed a committee to find a new site. Tech currently holds 2,500 students.About this time, the Toronto Athletic Club got into financial difficulties and its property was put up for sale. This was the building known as the Building on the south side of College St., which until recently housed the Ontario College of Art. The Technical School Board purchased it in 1900 for $80,000 plus back taxes, and agreed to raise a further $10,000 to convert it into a school. The first Art Department in the school was formed by putting a partition across the pool; sculpture was taught in the deep end of the tank and all the other art classes in the remaining area.Day classes began in 1901 with 151 students, while the attendance at night school continued to soar with 1,710 students registered. One of the main reasons for the popularity of the school was the highly professional staff under the capable leadership of Dr. William Pakenham, who was principal from 1901 until June, 1907.The period from 1900 to 1910 was one of great industrial growth in Canada and it soon became obvious that if Canada were to hold an influential place in world markets, a skilled labour force, backed by trained technicians, was a prime necessity. With this goal in mind, the Dominion Government requested Dr. John Seath to prepare a report on Education for Industrial Purposes. This report finally appeared in 1911. However, this is one instance where the City of Toronto was ahead of its time. Since 1907, it had been considering a site for a fine new technical school to be constructed as a purely civic enterprise. Finally, after many changes of mind, the present location was selected in 1912 and an agreement drawn up to permit the closing of Herrick Street between Lippincott and Borden Streets.The Board of Education appointed Dr. A.C. McKay as principal in June, 1911. Most of the solid foundation of technical education in Toronto can be justly ascribed to the work of this man; indeed, had subsequent Boards adhered to his original plans, the system would have been even better. A former professor of physics at U. of T., a chancellor of McMaster, and an experienced teacher in both elementary and secondary schools, Dr. McKay was a man with a great vision of technical education.Dr. McKay began his plans for Central Tech by first visiting the great polytechnical schools of Europe. He returned with very definite ideas about the kind of building he wanted and immediately announced a competition open to all architects. The competition was won by Ross and Macfarlane of Montreal. The cornerstone of the new building was laid on September 3, 1913, by Borden, Prime Minister of Canada.This building, with several expansions, remains the schools home to this day.Features originally incorporated in the building include the crest over the main entrance of the school, the coat of arms of the City of Toronto. Central Tech is the only school that has the privilege of using this crest; it is due to the fact that the citizens of Toronto paid for the school without the aid of other levels of government.The ribbon across the bottom of the crest carries the legend Industry, Intelligence, and Integrity. These qualities have always characterized our top graduates. The two capitals that top the columns supporting the main entrance arch presented a bit of a problem. The Scottish stonemasons who build the school wanted to make their own contribution to the building and they felt that the standard Gothic caps would lack interest. As their gift, they carved the two gnomes that surmount the columns. The one is dressed in academic cap and gown and is busy writing in a book, thus representing the academic side of the school. The second gnome is in the ancient garb of a journeyman working with hammer and chisel, representing the technical side of the school.The Exhibition Room, 208, with its fine paneling and fireplace, was a gift from the builder at no cost to the citizens. The principal s office occupied the whole of Room 202 It was beautifully paneled in dark red mahogany with a beamed ceiling and plaster medallions that were masterpieces of the plasterers art.The third floor was known as C floor and was reserved for the females. No male was allowed on this floor at any time except to go to the lunch room which occupied the corner and that part of the north corridor now given over to electronics. Segregation by sex was the order of the day and certain doors and stairs were reserved for use by females only.The auditorium has always been the focus of school activities. Central was one of the last schools to give up the tradition of daily opening exercises for the whole school. The auditorium was the scene of the official opening of the school on the evening of Tuesday, August 31, 1915 . Some thirty-six years later, on the morning of April 20, 1951, its doors were locked for the last time and the keys turned over to the contractors to begin its conversion into a gymnasium.The school gradually became more focused on educating the youth with the adult education programs being moved to other schools in the late 1930s.  In 1915 there were approximately 750 scholars. With an expected increase in student population the school ultimately had to expand. In 1932 to accommodate the increasing number of aircraft students, the city bought a garage, the Annex, at 844 Bathurst Street . It proved insufficient and in l951 a major addition was erected on the south side replacing the girls playing field. This new wing included aircraft and auto mechanic facilities, a new auditorium, and a cafeteria.Ten years later a separate addition was built on the boys playing field on the north side of the main building. It was to house the increasing number of art students who were overcrowded on the fifth floor of the main building (now the Mathematics Department). Much honour has been bestowed upon the architecture of the building and the high quality of work produced therein.Still another building was added in 1967 on the northwest corner of the campus. Referred to as the Bathurst Building it contains numerous shops, two gymnasia and an Olympic size swimming pool.The latest addition has been a large Uniroyal track. These additions replaced a tennis court, a small park, and a playing field on the entire west side block. Today the high school campus, one of the largest in the British Empire is a mixture of contrasting architecture: the gothic of the original building, and the ultramodern of the Art Centre and Bathurst buildings.Much honour was bestowed on the school concerning Central Techs group efforts. Among these were the Cadet Corps, the football team and later in the 30s and 40s the track team. Another highlight was the installment of the memorial organ. Originally built as a memorial to the unfortunate students who lost their lives in the First World War, it soon became an integral part of the school.War EffortDuring the Second World War, Central Techs extensive facilities were put to use in the war effort. The school was operated 24 hours a day. The day students attended from nine to three-thirty and from four p.m. to seven-thirty a.m. emergency classes were in progress. These classes were under the supervision of the Royal Canadian Air Force, Army and Navy. They involved marching drills, wireless operating, aircraft mechanics, tank repair and related subjects. Central Tech had the great honour of not only helping the community but the whole country.Arts ProgramIts visual arts program was especially renowned with graduates such as Harris, Mosher, and Bayefsky.SportsTrack & Field The fact that Central Tech had the only school track with a proper running surface may have led to its undeniable success in track and field. This culminated in the decade of the eighties. In 1983 Central Tech set a boys record for points in a provincal championships with an astounding 133 points.Grant Hoffman  sFile:Carl Folkes http://ofsaa-track.yolasite.com/Mike Shttp://www.mehockrelays.com/KeaneMahornFilm LocationSeveral films have utilized the school as a location, including Will Hunting, Evil: Apocalypse, of 1984 and Hill: Revelation 3D.Notable alumni*Belli, CFL player for the Argonauts*Black, CFL player for the Stampeders*Smith,  Decathlete CBC broadcaster for Athletic eventsIncidentsOn September 30, 2010, around 1:00 pm EST there was a confrontation between 4 students, at least one gunshot was fired from a semi-automatic pistol.

Steven_Milloy
Steven J. Milloy is a commentator for News and runs the Web site junkscience.com, which is dedicated to debunking what Milloy labels faulty scientific data and analysis. On Fox News Channel he is billed as a Science commentator. He describes himself as a libertarian.(Taking Out the Junk (Science), Interview in FrontPageMagazine.com, May 12, 2008.)Among the topics Milloy has addressed are what he believes to be false claims regarding DDT, warming, Alar, implants, secondhand smoke, depletion, and cow disease.(Milloys Website, junkscience.com, accessed 20 Sept 2006.) Milloy also runs CSRWatch.com, which monitors and criticizes the social responsibility movement. From the 1990s until the end of 2005, he was an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Institute, which hosted the JunkScience.com site. He is currently an adjunct scholar at the Enterprise Institute. Milloy is head of the Enterprise Action Fund, a fund he runs with former tobacco executive Tom Borelli. He also operates the of Sound Science Center, a organization which is critical of environmental science, from his home in Maryland. Milloy has authored four books.Milloys close financial and organizational ties to tobacco and oil companies have been the subject of criticism from a number of sources, as Milloy has consistently criticized the science linking secondhand smoke to health risks and human activity to global warming.(Mother Jones: Some Like It Hot.

The Cato Institute, where he was listed as an adjunct scholar, published his work from 1995 to 2005. Milloy began his criticism of Junk science as president of the Policy Analysis Network in 1996. In March 1997, Milloy became president of the Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (TASSC), which later became the Advancement of Sound Science Center.(http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/journals/esthag-w/2005/may/business/pt_junkscience.html.)  He has been a correspondent for  Fox News since 2002.Junk scienceMilloy has popularized the use of the term junk science in public debate, which he defines as faulty scientific data and analysis used to advance special and, often, hidden agendas. According to Milloy, the junk science mob includes: The MEDIA, who may use junk science for sensational headlines and programmingPERSONAL INJURY LAWYERS, who may use junk science to bamboozle juries into awarding huge verdicts, and others.() Milloy frequently applies the term to climate change science and certain health controversies.Scientists and science writers have argued the term is used, by Milloy and others, almost exclusively to denigrate scientists and studies whose findings do not serve the corporate cause, in the words of David Michaels.() In an editorial in and Engineering News, Editor-in-Chief Rudy Baum called Milloys junkscience.com website the best known example of  a right wing effort in the U.S. to discredit widely accepted science, technology and medicine. He went on to label Milloy a tireless antiscience polemicist who applies the term junk science to anything that doesnt match his right-wing concept of reality.() Along similar lines, an editorial in the Journal of Public Health noted that ... attacking the science underlying difficult public policy decisions with the label of junk has become a common ploy for those opposed to regulation. One need only peruse JunkScience.com to get a sense of the long list of public health issues for which research has been so labeled.()Secondhand smokeMilloy has criticized research linking secondhand tobacco smoke to cancer, claiming that the vast majority of studies reported no statistical association.(Secondhand Smokescreen, By Steven Milloy, March 9, 2001)  In 1993, Milloy dismissed an Environmental Protection Agency report linking secondhand tobacco smoke to cancer as a joke.  Five years later Milloy claimed vindication after a federal court criticized the EPAs conclusions. However, the courts finding against the EPA was overturned on appeal.When the Medical Journal published a meta-analysis confirming a link in 1997, Milloy wrote, Of the 37 studies, only 7less than 19 percentreported statistically significant increases in lung cancer incidence... Meta-analysis of the secondhand smoke studies was a joke when EPA did it in 1993. And it remains a joke today.(Secondhand Joking, by Steven Milloy) When another researcher published a study linking secondhand smoke to cancer, Milloy wrote that she ... must have pictures of journal editors in compromising positions with farm animals. How else can you explain her studies seeing the light of day?()()Links to tobacco industryWhile at FoxNews.com, Milloy has continued to criticize claims that secondhand tobacco smoke causes cancer.( However, with the release of confidential tobacco industry documents as part of the Master Settlement Agreement, the objectivity of Milloys stance on secondhand smoke has been questioned. Based on this documentation, journalists D. Thacker and Monbiot, as well as the of Concerned Scientists and others, have contended that Milloy is a paid advocate for the tobacco industry.(Milloys junkscience.com website was reviewed and revised by a relations firm hired by the J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.(Activity Report, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., December 1996, describing input from R.J.R. Tobaccos P.R. firm into Milloys junkscience website.

No one knows why ... it is unclear what effect CFC releases have had on the Earths ozone layer.(http://www.cato.org/askourscholars/milloy/)Climate ChangeMilloy has consistently argued from the position of a warming skeptic that human activity has little impact on change and that regulations to limit gas emissions are unwarranted and harmful to business interests.

Is anyones health at risk, asked the authors.(An Empty Uniform, by Michael Gough and Steven Milloy, The Wall Street Journal, 10 February 1998)(NCPA Idea House: Who Needs A Surgeon General?)DDTMilloy has campaigned against the 1972 ban on non-public-health uses of DDT in the United States and in favour of wider use of DDT against malaria, which he claims could be largely eliminated if DDT were used more aggressively. He has been particularly critical of Carson, who, he wrote, misrepresented the existing science on bird reproduction and was wrong about DDT causing cancer.(At Risk from the Pesticide Myth, by Steven Milloy, July 28, 2000)Milloys junkscience.com web site features The Malaria Clock: A Green Eco-Imperialist Legacy of Death,(The Malaria Clock: A Green Eco-Imperialist Legacy of Death) which he claims counts up the approximate number of new malaria cases and deaths in the world, most of which he says could have been prevented by the use of DDT. , Milloys clock stands at more than 94 million dead, 90% of whom are said to have been expectant mothers and children under five years of age. Infanticide on this scale appears without parallel in human history, writes Milloy. This is not ecology. This is not conservation. This is genocide.Critics have argued that the clock holds Carson responsible for more deaths than malaria has caused in total,(Rachel Carson, Mass Murderer? The creation of an anti-environmental myth, Aaron Swartz, Extra!, September/October 2007.) a charge that a footnote at the bottom of the malaria clock webpage seems to acknowledge, stating: Note that some of these cases would have occurred irrespective of DDT use. Note also that, while enormously influential, the US ban did not immediately terminate global DDT use and that developing world malaria mortality increased over time rather than instantly leaping to the estimated value of 2,700,000 deaths per year. However, certain in the knowledge that even one human sacrificed on the altar of green misanthropy is infinitely too many, I let stand the linear extrapolation of numbers from an instant start on the 1st of the month following this murderous ban.(However, Milloys website also misguided readers by implying that the US ban of DDT meant a worldwide ban. In fact, after its use was banned in the United States, DDT was still produced and exported by a number of countries, including the US, Mexico, India and China.(http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp35-c5.pdf DDT, DDE, and DDD: Production, import/export, use, and disposal.

Published September 14, 2001.)  Milloys article reported that, In 1971, New York City banned the use of asbestos in spray fireproofing. At that time, asbestos insulating material had only been sprayed up to the 64th floor of the World Trade Center towers, and cited an expert who questioned the efficacy of the asbestos-free lagging that was used on the steel in the upper floors.Advocates for banning asbestos were highly critical of the article,( questioning his motives and disputing his conclusions.

Writing for FoxNews.com, Milloy said that CSPI appears to have an unsavory relationship with Quorn competitor, Gardenburger and called the CSPIs complaints unscrupulous shrieking, noting comments in CSPI newsletters like Remember the saturated fat and the  E.coli bacteria that could be hiding inside hamburger? You can keep the  taste but forget the worries with Gardenburger.()EvolutionMilloys views on evolution are as follows: Explanations of human evolution are not likely to move beyond the stage of hypothesis or conjecture. There is no scientific way  i.e., no experiment or other means of reliable study  for explaining how humans developed. Without a valid scientific method for proving a hypothesis, no indisputable explanation can exist.The process of evolution can be scientifically demonstrated in some lower life forms, but this is a far cry from explaining how humans developed.That said, some sort of evolutionary process seems most likely in my opinion. But there will probably always be enough uncertainty in any explanation of human evolution to give critics plenty of room for doubt.()Rall controversyIn 1999, Platt Rall, a prominent scientist, died in a car accident. Steven Milloy, at the time a Cato adjunct scholar, commented: Scratch one junk scientist..... Cato Institute President Edward Crane called Milloys comments an inexcusable lapse in judgment and civility, but Milloy refused to apologize, stating Im sorry for Ralls family that hes dead.

Meriden_(UK_Parliament_constituency)
elects_howmany  OneMeriden is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the of the United Kingdom. It elects one of Parliament (MP) by the past the post system of election. It was first contested at the 1955 general election.  History  1955 - 1983 The Meriden County Constituency was created in 1955, following a review of parliamentary seats in Warwickshire by the boundary commission appointed under the of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949. The new constituency comprised three districts in the north of the county: Atherstone, Meriden and Tamworth.(The Parliamentary Constituencies (Birmingham and North Warwickshire) Order, 1955 (S.I. 1955/177)) The areas were transferred from the neighbouring constituencies of Nuneaton and Sutton Coldfield(F A Youngs Jr., Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol.II: Northern England, London, 1991) Tamworth Rural District was abolished in 1965, with most of its area redistributed between the two neighbouring rural districts. Accordingly, when parliamentary constituencies were reorganised throughout England in 1970, Meriden was redefined to consist only of Atherstone and Meriden Rural Districts.(The Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 1970 (S.I. 1970/1674)) This was only a minor boundary change. The seat was a Labour/Conservative marginal, covering the coal mining areas of northern Warwickshire and the more affluent area near Solihull.  It changed hands between the two parties several times, including in a by-election in 1968, which was won by Speed of the Conservatives. 1983 to date The next redistribution of constituencies was in 1983, reflecting the major boundary changes effected by the Government Act 1972. A new Meriden County Constituency was created as part of the parliamentary county of West Midlands, consisting of nine wards of the Borough of Solihull, namely Bickenhill, Bromwich, Wood, Fordbridge, Kingshurst, Knowle, Meriden, Packwood and Wood.(The Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 1983 (S.I. 1983/417)) The boundaries were unchanged in 1997.(The Parliamentary Constituencies (England) Order 1995 (S.I. 1995/1626))The 1983 boundary changes transformed the constituency into a safe Conservative seat, with the areas favouring Labour becoming part of a new North Warwickshire seat. Mills held the seat until he died in office in January 1997, with the seat remaining vacant until the dissolution of Parliament and no by-election being held. Spelman was victorious in the 1997 general election, though only by a narrow margin, and has held the seat since then, with the challenge from Labour becoming more distant.For the 2010 general election the constituency was redefined, following redrawing of the wards of the metropolitan borough. It now comprises the following nine wards: Bickenhill, Blythe, Castle Bromwich, Chelmsley Wood, Dorridge & Hockley Heath, Kingshurst & Fordbridge, Knowle, Meriden, Smiths Wood.( ) Boundaries The constituency is one of two covering the Borough of Solihull.  It covers therural area, known as the Gap, between the Midlands conurbation and Coventry, which contains villages such as Common, Hampton-in-Arden and Meriden itself.  It also covers some urban parts of the borough, particularly Bromwich and Wood (a large area of 1960s housing on the eastern edge of Birmingham), but also the affluent areas of Dorridge and Knowle. Members of Parliament The current MP is the Conservative Caroline Spelman. She has been member for the seat since 1997, and Environment Secretary since 2010.ElectionsElections in the 2010sElections in the 2000sElections in the 1990sGeneral Election 1997: Meriden()(C.

Warne_Marsh
 notable_instruments  Warne Marion Marsh (26 October 1927  18 December 1987) was an American tenor saxophonist born in Angeles.BiographyMarsh came from an affluent background: his father was the cinematographer Oliver T. Marsh (18921941), and his mother Elizabeth was a violinist. Marsh, the actress, was his aunt.He was tutored by Tristano and, along with Konitz, became one of the pre-eminent saxophonists of the Tristano-inspired school of jazz (often mislabeled as Cool). Of all of Tristanos students, Marsh came closest to typifying Tristanos ideals of improvised lines, in some respects, even transcending the master himself. Marsh remained one of the most faithful to the Tristano philosophy of improvisation &ndash; the faith in the purity of the long line, the avoidance of licks and emotional chain-pulling, the concentration on endlessly mining the same small body of standards. Nevertheless, his distinctively pure tone without the inflections popular among many other tenor saxophonists at that time such as honks, growls, exaggerated vibrato, slurs and glisses, etc. set Marsh apart from other Young and Webster-influenced saxophonists. Marshs rhythmically subtle lines are immediately recognizable. He has been called by Braxton the greatest vertical improviser.(Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings, p. 857.) In the 1970s he gained renewed exposure as a member of Supersax, a large ensemble which played orchestral arrangements of Parker solos. Marsh also recorded one of his most celebrated albums, All Music, with the Supersax rhythm section during this period. Marsh died onstage at the Los Angeles club Dontes in 1987, in the middle of playing the tune Out of Nowhere.(Warne Marsh, Peter Madsen, Allaboutjazz.com, Nov. 2001) Though he remains something of a cult figure among jazz fans and musicians, his influence has grown since his death; younger players such as Mark Turner have  borrowed from his music as a way of counterbalancing the pervasive influence of Coltrane.  Marshs discography remains somewhat scattered and elusive, as much of it was done for small labels, but more and more of his work has been issued on disc in recent years.A documentary is being done about him entitled, Warne Marsh: An Improvised Life directed by his oldest son, K.C.

Laurentine_Hamilton
Image:Laurentine Hamiltons bust at the Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton.JPG|right|thumb|Hamiltons bust at the Observatory on Mount Hamilton Laurentine Hamilton (1826 - April 9, 1882) was a Presbyterian minister accused of heresy, and founder of the Unitarian Church of Oakland.Hamilton was born in New York, near Seneca Lake. He graduated from Hamilton College in Clinton, New York in 1850. He went on to attend Theological Seminary, from which he graduated in 1853. In 1854, Hamilton became an ordained minister of the Presbyterian church in Ovid, New York. In 1855 he was assigned the pastorage of California, a small mining camp established during the Gold Rush. He built the Presbyterian church that still stands there. In 1859, Hamilton came to Jose, California to preach at the First Presbyterian Church of San Jose. He became Superintendent of San Jose Schools, and in 1861 he travelled with H. Brewer and F. Hoffmann to the summit of a nearby mountain, as part of the initial Geological Survey. That mountain, Mount Hamilton, is named after him.In 1864 Hamilton became pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Oakland, his sermons appearing in the Oakland Daily Tribune. He served on the Oakland of Education from 1866 to 1872. In 1869, Hamilton came under scrutiny for teaching the doctrine of a second probation after death (stating one has a second, posthumous chance of salvation). He was charged with heresey and forced to leave his pastorate and resign from his ordination in the Presbyterian church. Most of his parishioners joined him in forming the First Independent Presbyterian Church, later to become the Independent Church of Oakland. In 1879 the church joined the Unitarian Association and became the Unitarian Church of Oakland.While preaching on Sunday, 1882, Hamilton spoke We know not what matter is... and then collapsed onto the ground, dead.

Silver_City,_Idaho
 refnum  72000446()Silver City is a town in Owyhee County, Idaho, States. At its height in the 1880s it was a gold and mining town with a population of around 2,500 and approximately 75 businesses. Silver City served as seat of Owyhee County from 1867 to 1934. Today, the town has about 70 standing buildings, all of which are privately owned. Many of the owners are third- or fourth-generation descendants of the original miners. There are a handful of small businesses, but no gas or service stations.Silver City was founded in 1864 soon after silver was discovered at nearby Eagle Mountain. The settlement grew quickly and was soon considered one of the major cities in Territory. The first daily newspaper and telegraph office in Idaho Territory were established in Silver City. The town was also among the first places in present-day Idaho to receive electric and telephone service.After the placer and quartz vein mines were depleted around the time Idaho became a state in 1890, and due in part to its extremely remote location, Silver City began a slow decline but was never completely abandoned. Small-scale mining continued off and on until War II; the last mine to be operated all year round in Silver City was the Potossi, managed by Ned Williams. The Idaho Hotel in Silver City was restored and re-opened in 1972.thumb|left|300px|Our Lady of Tears, Silver CityIn 1972, the townsite and its environs were listed on the Register of Historic Places as a historic district, the Silver City Historic District, with a total area of .()Silver City is located 25 miles southwest of Murphy via a dirt road.ReferencesExternal links*Historic Silver City Idaho*Catherine Minear Moore*The Owyhee War -1868*Idaho State Historical Society Digital Collections pertaining to the Owyhee mining district

Newington_College
website  newingtoncollege.nsw.edu.auNewington College is an independent, Church, day and school for boys, located in Stanmore, an inner-western suburb of Sydney, South Wales, Australia.Established in 1863 at Silverwater, Newington is open to boys of all faiths and denominations. The college has two preparatory schools, House, in Cambridge Street, Stanmore, and the Preparatory School at Lindfield, on Sydneys Upper North Shore.( There is a rowing facility on the River at Abbotsford. Newington currently caters for approximately 1,580 students from Kindergarten to Year 12,( including 48 boarders from Years 7 to 12.()The school is a member of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA),() the School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA),() the Australian Boarding Schools Association,( and a founding member of the Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales (AAGPS).()The college prepares students for the Certificate, the Higher School Certificate and the Baccalaureate. (HistoryAt the Methodist Conference of 1862, the Rev John Manton proposed that a collegiate institute, decidedly Wesleyan in character, be founded in Sydney. It was expected that the school would be open to the sons of parents of all religious denominations, and on Thursday 16 July 1863, the Wesleyan Collegiate Institute opened with 16 boys and a small number of theological students. As no suitable buildings were available in Sydney at the time, House, the centrepiece of the  Blaxlands estate at Silverwater, was leased.Newington College, as the school soon became known, prospered during its time on the River and in 1869 was the first Australian school to play football (against the of Sydney),(A Sense of Union - A History of the Sydney University Football Club (Syd, 1998) pp 22) and soon after was the first school in Australia to hold an athletics carnival. The Newington College Cadet Unit is the oldest corps in the Army Cadets.Expanding student numbers meant that more extensive premises closer to the city were required. A bequest, by John Jones, of land at Stanmore, saw the College move to the newly fashionable inner-city suburbs in 1880. By resolution of the College Council, the name Newington College was perpetuated on the new site, and Newington has remained at Stanmore ever since. Seventy school and theological students migrated from Silverwater to Stanmore, and took residence in the grand stone edifice, designed by Rowe, that is still the centrepiece of Newington. The architectural historian Morton Herman said of Rowes design, the 1881 building is an almost perfect example of scholastic Revival architecture.(The Architecture of Victorian Sydney (Syd, 1956))A gymnasium was built in 1890, and a pool was opened in 1894. Newington ceased to be a Methodist theological training school in 1915, when College was founded at Strathfield South. In 1921, a stone Memorial, designed by Old Newingtonian Hardy Wilson, was opened in memory of those old boys who had paid the supreme sacrifice in War I. A separate preparatory school was first opened in 1921, after a bequest by Sir Samuel McCaughey. It became known as Wyvern House in 1938, when a new building was opened by Old Newingtonian Sir Percival Halse Rogers.In 1925 a rowing facility was built at Abbotsford, and in 1957 an additional preparatory school was founded on the North Shore - first at Killara, but now at Lindfield. Since the World War, the College buildings and facilities have expanded significantly. A new Education Centre, opened by Old Newingtonian Nick Farr-Jones AM, and a new boatshed at Abbotsford are two of the most recent additions. In 1998, Wyvern House moved to a separate campus in Cambridge Street, Stanmore, and the former building was renovated and renamed the Le Couteur Wing.()Recent EventsDuring 2006, the press reported on an industrial relations dispute at Newington when 40 department heads and housemasters were forced to reapply for their positions in a restructure that would also reduce their holidays. The then Headmaster, David Scott said that The action was taken after a comprehensive review of the school and had nothing to do with the federal governments Work Choices reforms() David Scott, advised that if senior teachers did not reapply for their current positions they could stay on as classroom teachers or be made redundant. 69 of 70 teachers voted at a union meeting not to apply for 40 senior positions Mr Scott had made available as part of a reorganisation of middle-management at the college. The Morning Herald reported that David Scott believed that the union was being mischievous at best, or using an outright and deliberate lie in suggesting the restructure was linked to workplace legislation.() The dispute was politicised when Greens MLC Rhiannon called on the New South Wales Government to withhold funding from the school because of the plans to force 40 teachers to re-apply for their own jobs. The headmaster said the move has been planned for nearly a year and has rejected suggestions that he is trying to exploit the Governments industrial relations laws. The Greens Lee Rhiannon said she finds that hard to believe.Its certainly very similar to what WorkChoices allow employers to do, she said.(http://www.abc.net.au/news/items/200605/1645139.htm?sydney) Following a meeting between the Independent Education Union and Newington College, David Scott agreed not to declare senior staff positions vacant and the school continued to negotiate collective arrangements covering salary and working conditions for staff. This maintains the previous arrangement rather than the schools initial proposal to introduce up to four weeks compulsory attendance.(http://news.ieu.asn.au/881.html) Despite the agreement between the Independent Education Union and Newington College, the Morning Herald quoted anonymous teachers that tensions remain and that the school body had been fractured by the dispute, and there is deep-seated mistrust of Mr Scott and of the College Councils plans. The IEU had asked the Uniting Church, which owns the school, to step in to ensure the school maintains fair employment practices said NSW general secretary, Dick Shearman.() The Sydney Morning Herald said that the College has threatened to sue a parent whose company conducted a survey that found 43 per cent of the schools teachers were considering quitting, and just 13 per cent have faith in the headmaster and council.( The results showed that found only 35 percent felt they were treated with respect and dignity. Just 6 percent reported high or very high morale, contrasting with 75 per cent who reported low or very low morale. One in three teachers believe they do not have a future at the school.() In October 2006, a facilitator was appointed to assist the College through the issues that were generating significant concern amongst the teaching staff. These issues were addressed by a working group established by Council and coordinated by the facilitator in the first three months of 2007. The working group first met on 24 January 2007 and reported to the College Council in April 2007.(http://www.newingtoncollege.nsw.edu.au/council/070208_WorkingGroup_Report.pdf)In September 2008, Newingtons end of year muck-up day resulted in four students being banned and under police investigation, three students suspended and a further 43 students stopped from attending a graduation function. The reported rebellion left a teachers car and the school hall vandalised. Students blamed the incident on the then Headmaster David Scotts zero-tolerance approach.(http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/mad-over-muck-up-day/story-e6frf0a0-1111117597565)College staffPresidents and HeadmastersFrom its founding in 1863 until 1900, Newington had a system of dual control with a President (who was an ordained minister) and a Headmaster. As an ordained minister, Prescott assumed both roles on his appointment in 1900 and on his retirement in 1931 the role of President was abolished.Notable teachersCampusesNewington College is situated over three suburban campuses, located in Stanmore and Lindfield:(Secondary schoolThe secondary campus is located in Stanmore, in Sydneys inner-west.

It was originally placed in a grove of trees to the north of the Founders Wing but was moved to its present location in the early 1960s to make way for the construction of the Centenary Hall which was opened in 1963. The memorial comprises a semi-circular wall and seat, with pillars surmounted by white stone urns at either end and a column with a sundial stands at the centre. The inscription on the wall reads: 1914 - To Our Beloved Dead - 1918 and the inscription on the sundial reads: Time dims not their sacrifice. The memorial was dedicated on 11 May 1922 by the General of Australia and the Old Newingtonian poet Holdsworth Allen wrote a poem, To our beloved dead, in memory of the occasion.(Register of War Memorials in New South Wales - Newington College Memorial to the Dead 1914-1918 Retrieved 7-10-2009)Gallipoli Lone Pine MemorialCommemorating of War during World War I, this tree comes from a seedling propagated from a pine cone brought home from Gallipoli by an Australian soldier.

A bronze commemorative plaque on a stone plinth has the following inscription: The Gallipoli Lone Pine - During the 1914-1918 Great War, Australian and New Zealand forces landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 to attack Turkish forces. Eight months later they withdrew. One significant battle occurred on the ridge where a lone pine stood. ANZAC forces finally occupied the Turkish position, but with the tragic loss of 2,227 men. Turkish losses were around 5,000. During the withdrawal from ANZAC Cove, an Australian soldier picked up a pine cone and brought it home, where the seeds were propagated. Since 1933, when the pines became of good size and yielded more seedlings, Legacy arranged for pine trees to be distributed to schools and interested groups to help keep the memory of the Gallipoli Lone Pine alive.

Marion_Lorne
 spouse         Walter C. Hackett (d. 1944)Marion Lorne MacDougall (August 12, 1883(http://www.nndb.com/people/614/000161131/)(http://www.harpiesbizarre.com/beographylorne.htm)  May 9, 1968) was an American actress. After a career in theatre in New York and London, Lorne made her first film in 1951, and for the remainder of her life, played small roles in films and television.  Her recurring role as Aunt Clara in the comedy series, Bewitched brought her widespread recognition, and a posthumous Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.OriginShe was born in Pittston, Pennsylvania, a small mining town halfway between Wilkes-Barre and Scranton, of Scottish and English immigrant parents. While her year of birth is listed as 1885 on her tombstone, it was usually listed as 1888 when she was alive and the Social Security Death Index lists it as 1883. Lorne studied at the Academy of Dramatic Arts in York City. She married playwright Hackett, who died in 1944.CareerLorne debuted on Broadway in 1905; she also acted in London theaters, enjoying a flourishing stage career on both sides of the Atlantic. A latecomer to films, she made her screen debut in 1951, at the age of 63 in Hitchcocks Strangers on a Train.  The role was typical of the befuddled, nervous, and somewhat aristocratic matrons that she usually portrayed.In the early 1950s, Lorne was seen as perpetually confused high school English teacher Mrs. Gurney on the pioneering sitcom Peepers. From 1957-1958, she co-starred with Caulfield in the NBC sitcom Sally in the role of an elderly widow and the co-owner of a store.() Between 1958 and 1961, she was a regular on Garry Moore Show prime time comedy program.Her last role, as Aunt Clara in televisions Bewitched, brought Lorne her widest fame. She played a lovable, forgetful witch who is losing her powers because of her old age and whose spells usually end in disaster. Aunt Clara is obsessed with doorknobs, often bringing her collection with her on visits. Lorne had an extensive collection of doorknobs in real life, some of which she used as props in the series.()She appeared in twenty-eight episodes and was not replaced after she died of a heart attack in York City during the fifth season, aged 84. Bewitched producers realized that Lornes portrayal of the beloved Aunt Clara could not be replicated. Instead, character actress Ghostley was recruited to fill the gap as the newly-created Esmeralda. Coincidentally, Lorne and Ghostley appeared side-by-side in Graduate as partygoers Miss DeWitte and Mrs. Singleman the year before Lornes death.() She received a posthumous Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on Bewitched. The statue was accepted by Montgomery.FilmographyAwards and nominationsReferencesExternal links* * * LorneLorneLorneLorneLorneLorneLorne

UnitedHealth_Group
UnitedHealth Group Incorporated  is a diversified health and well-being company. Headquartered in Minnesota, UnitedHealth Group offers a spectrum of products and services through two operating businesses: UnitedHealthcare and Optum. Through its family of subsidiaries and divisions, UnitedHealth Group serves approximately 70 million individuals nationwide. In 2010, the company posted a net income of $4.6 billion.(2008 Annual Form 10-K on file with the SEC at http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID7711449-275277-279467&typesect&dcn0001193125-11-030615)UnitedHealth Group is the parent of UnitedHealthcare, a large health insurer in the States. It was created in 1977, as UnitedHealthCare Corporation (it was renamed in 1998), but traces its origin to a firm it acquired in 1977, Charter Med Incorporated, which was founded in 1974. In 1979, it introduced the first network-based health plan for seniors. In 1984, it became a publicly traded company.J.D. Power and Associates recently gave UnitedHealthcare the highest employer satisfaction rating for self-insured health plans (http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2011/07/14/j-d-power-employers-kaiser.html J. D. Power: Employers give high marks for Kaiser, UnitedHealthcare Business Journal J.D. Power Rankings). UnitedHealthcare also received high marks from the American Medical Association (AMA) in its 2011 National Health Insurance Report Card. (http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/solutions-managing-your-practice/coding-billing-insurance/heal-claims-process/national-health-insurer-report-card.page National Health Insurer Report Card Medical Association (AMA) National Health Insurer Report Card). The fourth annual report card evaluated seven national health insurance companies on the timeliness and accuracy of their claims processing based on a variety of payment, approval and process metrics. UnitedHealthcare moved into the top spot among its industry peers on two metrics: Contracted Fee Schedule Match Rate, which indicates how often an insurers claim payment matches the contracted fee schedule; and Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) Accuracy, which measures the rate at which the insurers allowed amount equals the physician practices expected allowed amount. And in a recent insurance industry publication, Insurance, United was named readers choice winner 2010 for Best health plan provider. ( http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20101103/news/101109957# Business Insurance names 2010 Readers Choice Awards winners Insurance  2010 Readers Choice Award). To contrast, however, in a 2010 survey of hospital executives who have dealt with the company, United received a 65% unfavorable rating. While this marks a 33% improvement over the prior years survey, UnitedHealthcare still ranked last among all listed.(http://www.thedailysound.com/04012010-survey, Daily Sound, April 1, 2010)In 2010, UnitedHealth Group spent more than $1.8 million on lobbying activities to work to achieve favorable legislation, and hired  seven different lobbying firms to work on its behalf. (Center for Responsive Politics, accessed Feb. 3, 2011,http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?lnameUnitedHealth+Group&year2010) In addition, its corporate political action committee or PAC, called United for Health, spent an additional $1 million on lobbying activities in 2010. (Centerl for Responsive Politics, accessed Feb. 3, 2011, http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strIDC00274431&cycle2010)AcquisitionsIn 1995, the company acquired MetraHealth Companies Inc. for $1.75 billion. MetraHealth was a privately held company formed by combining the group health care operations of The Travelers Insurance Company and Life Insurance Company also known as MetLife.In July 2004, UnitedHealth Group acquired Health Plans and all of United Healthcares New York-based small group contracts are now Oxford Health Plans products. In December 2005, the company received final regulatory approval for its $9.2 billion purchase of Health Systems. It agreed to divest parts of PacifiCares commercial health insurance business in Arizona and Colorado to satisfy antitrust regulator concerns, and also agreed to end its network access agreement with Shield of California.In March 2007, UnitedHealth Group signed a definitive agreement to acquire Health Services Inc. for $2.6 billion. Sierra provided health benefits and services to 310,000 members in Nevada and another 320,000 people in senior and government programs throughout the United States.In June 2009, Ingenix, a UHG subsidiary, acquired AIM Healthcare.  AIM is the leading data mining and insurance claim auditing service in the US.In July 2009, UnitedHealth Group Inc. agreed to acquire Health Net Inc.s (HNT) Northeast licensed subsidiaries for up to $570 million in payments spread out over a two year period.( )In July 2010, Ingenix acquired Picis Inc. Picis is a leading provider of health information solutions for the high-acuity areas of hospitals.(http://www.ingenix.com/News/Article/168/) Legal issues In 2006, the and Exchange Commission (SEC) began investigating the conduct of UnitedHealth Groups management and directors, for backdating of stock options. Investigations were also begun by the Revenue Service and prosecutors in the U.S. attorneys office for the Southern District of New York, who subpoenaed documents from the company. The investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in the Street Journal in May 2006, discussing apparent backdating of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of options by UHC management. The backdating apparently occurred with the knowledge and approval of the directors, according to the Journal. Major shareholders have filed lawsuits accusing former Jersey governor Kean and UHCs other directors of failing in their fiduciary duty.(A Board With Its Back To The Wall: UnitedHealth directors arent ready to oust embattled CEO McGuire. Heres why, Business Week, July 10, 2006)(Joe Conason, Jersey hustler: Why did former Gov. Kean, once a respected statesman, mislead the public and the press about the accuracy of ABCs Path to 9/11?, Salon magazine, September 15, 2006) On October 15, 2006, CEO W. McGuire was forced to resign, and relinquish hundreds of millions of dollars in stock options. On December 6, 2007, the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire will repay $468 million, as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution. Legal actions filed by the SEC against UnitedHealth Group itself are still pending.(http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071207/ap_on_bi_ge/unitedhealth_options;_yltAuCMgfPkc_LObP55Hz1fUmOs0NUE Associated Press via Yahoo News)In June 2006, the Chiropractic Association filed a national class action lawsuit against the Chiropractic Network (ACN), which is owned by UnitedHealth Group and administers chiropractic benefits, and against UnitedHealth Group itself, for alleged practices in violation of the federal Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).(American Chiropractic Association Files Lawsuit Against ACN in Federal Court, press release, American Chiropractic Association, June 13, 2006, retrieved March 7, 2008)IngenixIn February 2008, New York State Attorney General M. Cuomo announced an industry-wide investigation into a scheme by health insurers to defraud consumers by manipulating reasonable and customary rates. The announcement included a statement that Cuomo intended to file suit against Ingenix, Inc., its parent UnitedHealth Group, and three additional subsidiaries.  Cuomo asserted that his investigation found that rates found in a database of health care charges maintained by Ingenix were lower than what he determined was the actual cost of certain medical expenses. Cuomo said this inappropriately allowed health insurance companies to deny a portion of provider claims, thereby pushing costs down to members.(Cuomo Announces Industry-Wide Investigation into Health Insurers Fraudulent Reimbursement Scheme, press release, Office of the Attorney General, New York State, February 13, 2008, retrieved March 7, 2008)On January 13, 2009, UnitedHealth Group and Ingenix announced an agreement with the New York State attorney settling the probe into the independence of the health pricing database. Under the settlement, UnitedHealth Group and Ingenix would pay $50 million to finance a new, non-profit entity that would develop a new health care pricing database. Ingenix would discontinue its medical pricing databases when the new entity makes its product available. The company acknowledged the appearance of a conflict of interest, but admitted no wrongdoing.(UnitedHealth settles New York reimbursement probe)On January 15, 2009, UnitedHealth Group announced a $350 million settlement of three class action lawsuits filed in Federal court by the Medical Association, UnitedHealth Group members, healthcare providers, and state medical societies for not paying out-of-network benefits. This settlement came two days after a similar settlement with Cuomo.(UnitedHealth Group Settles for $350 Million, Reuters, January 13, 2009)On October 27, 2009, Cuomo announced the creation FAIR Health, the independent, non-profit organization that will develop a nationwide database for consumer reimbursement, as well as a website where consumers will be able to compare prices before they choose doctors. To fund FAIR Health, the Attorney Generals office secured nearly $100 million from insurers such as Aetna, UnitedHealth Group, and WellPoint.(Cuomo sets healthcare reimbursement reform, Reuters, October 27, 2009)Options backdating investigations and lawsuitsIn 2006, the SEC began investigating the conduct of UnitedHealth Groups management and directors, including Dr. McGuire, as did the Revenue Service and prosecutors in the U.S. attorneys office for the Southern District of New York, who have subpoenaed documents from the company.The investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in the Street Journal in May 2006, discussing the apparent backdating of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stock optionsin a process called backdatingby UnitedHealth Group management. The backdating apparently occurred with the knowledge and approval of the directors, according to the Journal. Major shareholders have filed lawsuits accusing former Jersey governor Kean and UnitedHealth Groups other directors of failing in their fiduciary duty.((Loren Steffy, How William McGuire earned that fat paycheck, Houston Chronicle newspaper, November 7, 2006)Resignation of McGuireOn October 15, 2006, it was announced that Dr. McGuire would step down immediately as chairman and director of UnitedHealth Group, and step down as CEO on December 1, 2006, due to his involvement in the employee stock options scandal. Simultaneously, it was announced that he would be replaced as CEO by Stephen Hemsley, who has served as President and COO and is a member of the board of directors.(http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061015/ap_on_bi_ge/unitedhealth_ceo) McGuires exit compensation from UnitedHealth, expected to be around $1.1 billion, would be the largest parachute in the history of America.(http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/biz/4318193.html)McGuires compensation became controversial again on May 21, 2009, when Edwards, speaking on Daily Show, used it to support her argument for a public alternative to commercial insurance(WonkRoom page including embedded clip from The Daily Show). Edwards stressed the importance of restoring competition in health insurance markets noting that at one point, the President of UnitedHealth made so much money, that one of every $700 that was spent in this country on health care went to pay him.Estimates of McGuires 2005 compensation range from $59,625,444(UnitedHealth Group Case Study, 2005 AFL-CIO estimate of McGuire compensation) to $124.8 million(United Health CEO earned $124.8 million in 2005 Health Care Economist, February 14, 2006), and the revenue of UnitedHealth Group was then $71 billion. It has therefore been suggested that Mrs. Edwards may have meant to say that one of every $700 that was spent on UnitedHealth Group premiums went to pay McGuire.McGuires settlement with SECOn December 6, 2007, the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire was to repay $468 million, including a $7 million civil penalty, as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution. He was also barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years.(Securities and Exchange Commission v. William W. McGuire, M.D., Civil Action No. 07-CV-4779-JMR/FLN (D.

The SEC continued its investigations even after it in 2008 settled legal actions against both UnitedHealth Group itself and its former general counsel.(SEC Files Settled Enforcement Actions Against UnitedHealth Group and Former General Counsel in Stock Options Backdating Case SEC Press release 2008-302).Health Care ReformThrough 2010 and into 2011, UnitedHealth senior executives have been meeting monthly with executives of leading health insurers to limit the effect of the health care reform law.(Bloomberg, UnitedHealth Joins WellPoint to Hone Health Law Lobby, January 31, 2011, http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-31/unitedhealth-joins-wellpoint-in-alliance-aiming-to-hone-health-law-lobby.html) Businesses Business services*UnipriseHealth care services*AmeriChoice*Ovations*Oxford*Golden Rule*Pacificare*UHG International*UnitedHealthcare**Mid Atlantic Medical Services LLC (MAMSI)Knowledge and information services*OptumInsight (formerly Ingenix)**i3 Innovus**i3 Research (a Research Organization)**Ingenix Consulting**The Lewin Group**AxolotlSpecialized care services*OptumRx (formerly Prescription Solutions)*ACN Group*Dental Benefit Providers*National Benefit Resources*OptumHealth*Spectera*Unimerica Workplace Benefits*United Behavioral Health*United Resource NetworksThe Lewin GroupThe Lewin Group is a policy research and consulting firm that provides economic analysis of health care and human services issues and policies.()The organization has existed for about 40 years and has maintained a nonpartisan reputation through its many ownership changes that have occurred over that time.(The Lewin Group was purchased in 2007 by Ingenix, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, but maintains editorial and analytical independence from its parent company.(The Lewin Group discloses its ownership in its reports and on its web site. While the Lewin Group does not advocate for or against any legislation, both Democratic and Republican politicians frequently cite the firms studies to argue for and against various healthcare reform proposals.() For example, Democratic Senator Wyden uses Lewin Group estimates to cite the feasibility of his Americans Act.( url  http://wyden.senate.gov/newsroom/record.cfm?id303144) Representative Cantor, the House Republican Whip, has referred to the organization as the nonpartisan Lewin Group in arguing against government-funded health insurance proposals.Recently, several Lewin studies have been used to argue both for and against the inclusion of a public option in national health reform. Lewin clients who often cite its findings include Commonwealth Fund which recently held up a Lewin study it commissioned to advocate for a public plan. The report showed that legislative proposals would achieve nearly universal coverage and estimated that a public plan could offer small businesses insurance that is at least 9 percent cheaper than current small-business policies.()However, The Lewin Group has acknowledged that clients sometimes choose not to publicize the results of studies they have commissioned. Indeed, Lewin Group Vice President John Sheils told the Washington Post sometimes studies come out that dont show exactly what the client wants to see. And in those instances, they have the option to bury the study.() Foundations UnitedHealth Group has two foundations, the United Health Foundation and UnitedHealthcare Childrens Foundation which were formed in 1999. United Health Foundation provides information to support decisions that lead to better health outcomes and healthier communities, such as their partnership behind the Health Rankings annual report. The Foundation also supports activities that expand access to quality health care services for those in challenging circumstances and partners with others to improve the well being of communities. Since established by UnitedHealth Group in 1999 as a not for profit private foundation, the Foundation has committed more than $170 million to improve health and health care.(UnitedHealth Group Foundations)References(External links*UnitedHealth Group Official Web Site.*UnitedHealth Group at NNDB.*UnitedHealth Group stock quote & chartde:UnitedHealth

Yulin,_Shaanxi
Yulin (; pinyin: Yln) is a city in the Shaanxi province of the Republic of China. It has an area of 43,578 km and a population of 3,380,000.( Profile of Yulin, visited on June 2, 2008.)Geography and climateYulin is the northernmost prefecture-level city of Shaanxi province, and borders the provincial-level divisions of Mongolia to the north, Shanxi to the east and Ningxia to the west as well as Yanan City to the south. To the north and northwest of the city lies the Desert, though the countryside is very green due to the many small shrubs which have been planted to slow the process of desertification. The city is based in a valley which extends north-south, which rises to a very large vantage point to the north east, where a spectacular view of the west and northwest is seen.Yulin has a continental, monsoon-influenced climate (Kppen BSk), with very cold, rather long winters, and hot and somewhat humid summers. Monthly averages range from  to  in July, and the annual mean is . Spring is especially prone to sandstorms blowing in from the northwest. There is only  of precipitation annually, 73% of which occurs from June to September. Due to the aridity, temperature variation is large for most of the year, averaging  annually, and sunshine is abundant, averaging 2,780 hours annually. Transportation *National Highway 210HistoryYulin played host to the 11th CHIME (European Foundation for Chinese Music Research) conference in August 2006.AdministrationYulin consists of one county-level administrative district, and 11 counties.CultureBecause of its relative isolation, a considerable amount of classical architecture remains in the city proper including the original city wall, some of which has been restored.  Other cultural relics include the Zhen Bei Tai watchtower, built during the Ming Dynasty, which is the largest troop fortress built on the entire Great Wall, with original and restored pieces of the original Great Wall juxtaposed on both sides. There is a large restoration in process on this area of the Great Wall. In addition, pieces of the ancient Great Wall built during the Dynasty are scattered along the outskirts of town. There is also the Red Stone Gorge, a canyon lined with grottoes containing carved ancient writing and Buddhist art. The town also contains an ancient pagoda.The Chinese dialect of Jin is spoken in Yulin.EconomyAlthough most of the local people live in a very minimal fashion, coal mining provides the predominant source of income. For some, coal mining has brought great riches.There is a new oil-field project (2005+) just to the west of Yulin which is drilling wells for natural gas, and this has brought a good deal of money into the local economy.This new oil/gas development is the current largest onshore project cooperated by the PetroChina and International Energy Company (Shell) in Mainland of China since 1999 (Product Sharing Contract(PSC) signed). In 2005, this project progressed to the construction and drilling phase and delivered gas into Shaanxi-Jing No.2 pipeline in 2007. The target annual gas production is 3 billion cubic meters (BCM) after this project reaches its full production capacity.ReferencesExternal links*Official website of Yulin Government*Yulin University*How to study at the Yulin University*CREC (The Research Centre for the Recovery of Ecology and Culture in the Loess-Plateau)Shaanxi(Shaanxi)(Shaanxi)(Shaanxi)(Shaanxi) ( )(Shaanxi)ja:(Shaanxi)(Shaanxi)()LmShaanxizh:

Moon_in_fiction
Image:Wappen von Grabow.png|thumb|right|280px|The moon on the coat of arms of Grabow, Germany.The Moon has been the subject of many works of art and literature and the inspiration for countless others. It is a motif in the visual arts, the performing arts, poetry, prose and music.Art and popular culture(cheese)Literary*Heywoods Proverbes (1546) commented that The moon is made of a greene cheese, greene meaning not aged, but was probably being sarcastic. http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a990723a.html* One of the earliest fictional flights to the Moon took place on the pages of Ariostos well-known Italian romantic epic furioso (1516). The protagonist Orlando, having been thwarted in love, goes mad with despair and rampages through Europe and Africa, destroying everything in his path. The English knight Astolfo, seeking to find a cure for Orlandos madness, flies up to the Moon in Elijahs flaming chariot. In this depiction, the Moon is where everything lost on earth is to be found, including Orlandos wits, and Astolfo brings them back in a bottle and makes Orlando sniff them, thus restoring him to sanity. *In the Moon Hoax of 1835, a newspaper reporter concocted a series of stories purporting to describe the discovery of life on the Moon, talking of such creatures as winged humanoids and goats.*Roverandom by Tolkien was written in 1925 to console his son Michael, then four years old, for the loss of a beloved toy dog. In the story, the dog has flown to the Moon and had a whole series of amusing adventures there. The story was only published posthumously. In addition, Isil and the guidesman Tilion in R. R. Tolkiens fictional Middle-earth cosmology are based in Tolkiens familiarity with Norse and Gaelic myths of the moon.*Dolittle in the Moon (1928) was intended to be the last of Loftings Dolittle books. The Doctor, with his unique ability to communicate with animals, arrived in the Moon on the back of a giant moth and finds a considerably different kind of fauna (for example, Moon insects are far bigger than the local birds), and more startlingly, intelligent plants whose language he learns (as he never did with earthly plants). He also meets the Moons single human inhabitant, a prehistoric man who has grown into an enormous giant due to lunar foods and conditions (which soon happens to the doctor himself). But it is doubtful whether he would ever be allowed to return to Earth.*In S. Lewiss Hideous Strength, the Moon (Sulva) is described as being home to a race of extreme eugenicists. On the near side, the elite caste seems to have dispensed with organic existence altogether, by some means never clearly described; the only holdouts against this trend are an embattled minority on the far side. The response of the characters to this state of affairs varies according to their status: Professor Filostrato, of the wicked N.I.C.E., considers the Sulvans a great race, further advanced than we, while the Christian champion Ransom describes them as an accursed people, full of pride and lust.*Moon (1947) by Wise Brown, illustrated by Hurd.*Winter Moon, a poem  by Hughes.*Palace (1989) by Auster, one of his best-known and most complicated novels.*Kidnapping of the Moon, a novel of Georgian author, Gamsakhurdia.*lEnnui de la Lune, a short story by Edward Desautels in which the Moon appears as ostensible first-person narrator, http://maximumfiction.wordpress.com/2009/07/30/lennui-de-la-lune/.Theatre*The End of the Moon by Anderson is a 90-minute monologue created as part of Andersons two years as NASA artist-in-residence. It premiered in a two-week run at the Academy of Musics Harvey Theater in March 2005.*Far Side of the Moon by Lepage, a theatre creator/performer from Qubec.CinemaExcepting its representation in films that are principally science fiction (see below), the depiction of The Moon is a significant element of the following films.* The final scenes of Mnchhausen (Germany, 1943, dir. von Bky) take place on The Moon.MusicClassical*The Moonlight Sonata (1801) by van Beethoven is probably the most widely recognised classical piece commonly called by a lunar title, but the composer never connected it with the moon.  The name by which the piece is commonly known is due to the critic Rellstabs comparing the piece to the effect of moonlight on Lake Lucerne, several years after its composition.*Au Clair de Lune (By The Light of The Moon) by Debussy approaches the fame of the Moonlight sonata. Debussy also wrote The Terrace for Moonlight.*Song to the Moon appears in Dvoks opera Rusalka (1900).*An den Mond in einer Herbstnacht D.614, and several settings of An den Mond are among Schuberts Lieder set poems with lunar subjects.*Lunaire, a modernist work by Schoenberg, treats the subject of a moon-struck Pierrot.*Oceans, a work for voices and instruments by Jenkins, deals with the various imagined seas of the moon*Less widely known works include**To the Moonlight by MacDowell.**Boro Budur in Moonlight by Godowsky.**Aries Moon (1938) by Dennis Ruff.**Aria of the Moon by Cvikl.**Der Mond, fairytale opera by Orff.JazzMany jazz standards have been inspired by the moon, some of the most notable examples are:*On, Harvest Moon (Norworth, Bayes)*Blue Moon (Rodgers, Hart)*By the Light of the Silvery Moon (Gus Edwards, Madden)*Wished on the Moon (Parker, Rainger)*Moon Song (Coslow, Arthur Johnston)*Moondance (Morrison)*Moonlight Becomes You (Johnny Burke, Van Heusen)*Moonlight in Vermont  (Suessdorf, Blackburn)*Serenade (Miller, Parish)*Dots and Moonbeams (Basie)*for the Moon (Berlin)*Old Devil Moon (Lane, Harburg)The Moon takes on several roles in the lyrics of these songs. In songs such as Blue Moon, No Moon at All, Serenade and Moonlight in Vermont, the Moon frames or creates the atmosphere of romance that the protagonist finds themselves in.The Moon is also viewed as an unobtainable object in songs such as for the Moon, I Wished on the Moon and Oh, You Crazy Moon, once again mirroring the situation of the protagonist.Sinatra recorded an entire album of songs written about the moon called Sinatra, recalling the name of Beethovens Moonlight Sonata.

The theme did not become popular until the seventeenth century, however, when the invention of the telescope hastened the popular acceptance of the concept of a world in the Moon, that is, that the Moon was an inhabitable planet, which might be reached via some sort of arial carriage. The concept of another world, close to our own and capable of looking down at it from a distance, provided ample scope for satirical comments on the manners of the Earthly world. Among the early stories dealing with this concept are:*Somnium (1541) by Maldonado.*The Dream (Somnium) (1634) by Kepler (written before 1610, but not published during Keplers life).

Darwin_from_Insectivorous_Plants_to_Worms
The life and work of Darwin from Insectivorous Plants to Worms featured a continuation from   Darwins investigations into insectivorous plants and climbing plants which he had begun before his work on Descent of Man and Emotions. Worries about family illnesses contributed to his interest in Galtons ideas of hereditary improvement (which would later be called Eugenics). He continued to help with the work of Downe parish church and associated village amenities, despite problems with control being seized by a new High Church vicar, and he remained on good terms with the Churchs patron, the Revd. John Brodie Innes. There was continuing interest in  Darwins views on religion, but he remained reticent.Despite repeated problems and delays caused by Darwins illness, his work on evolution-related experiments and investigations continued, with the production of books on the movement of climbing plants, insectivorous plants, the effects of cross and self fertilisation of plants, different forms of flowers on plants of the same species, and Power of Movement in Plants. His ideas on evolution were increasingly accepted in scientific circles despite some bitter disputes, and he received numerous honours. As well as writing out his own autobiography for his family, he wrote an introduction to a biography of his grandfather Darwin.  In his last book, he returned to the effect earthworms have on soil formation.He died in Downe, Kent, England, on 19 April 1882. He had expected to be buried in St Marys churchyard at Downe, but at the request of Darwins colleagues, Spottiswoode (President of the Society) arranged for Darwin to be given a major ceremonial funeral and buried in Abbey, close to Herschel and Newton.()Background In the aftermath of the publication of On the Origin of Species through Natural Selection in 1859, Darwins allies Lyell, Dalton Hooker, Huxley, Russel Wallace and Gray in America worked to spread acceptance of its ideas despite difficulty in coming to terms with selection and mans descent from animals. Darwins research and experiments on plants and animals continued, and his extensive writings countered the arguments against evolution, particularly those put by the Duke of Argyll and St George Mivart.      Family matters, eugenics Darwins sons George and Horace were ill and arrived home at Christmas 1872 for nursing. Darwin turned from his insectivorous plants to a more leisurely update of his monograph on climbing plants. He was intrigued by Galtons latest hereditary improvement ideas (which would be called Eugenics after 1883), proposing that society should breed out mental and physical disability and improve the nations stock by introducing a sentiment of caste among those who are naturally gifted. Families would be registered and incentives offered so that the best children chosen from each superior family would marry and reproduce. Darwin, aware that of his brood only William had good health, had already dismissed the aims as too utopian in Descent of Man. He thought these new proposals impractical if voluntary and politically horrifying if enforced by compulsory registration, even were they the sole feasible way of improving the human race. He felt it better simply to publicise the all-important principle of inheritance and let people pursue the grand objective for themselves. In any case it was too late for his own infirm offspring. Huxley was also ill, needing a rest and harried by a neighbour suing over a damp basement. The Club (a dining club formed in November 1864 to support the evolutionary new reformation in naturalism, including Huxley, Hooker, Tyndall, Busk, Spencer, and Spottiswoode) raised a 2,000 collection for him, primed by Darwin with 300. Darwins spirits were again downcast when Lyells wife died. In June 1873 Darwin resumed work on his insectivorous plants, with some distractions as his wife Emma took care of the seven Huxley children while Huxley and Hooker went on holiday to the continent. Having young children in the house was like the 1850s again. Parish conflict A new reforming High Church vicar, the Revd. Sketchley Ffinden, had been imposing his ideas since taking over the parish in November 1871. Darwin had to write to the patron, Brodie Innes, explaining what had upset the parishioners. Ffinden now usurped control of the village school which had been run for years by a committee of Darwin, Lubbock and the incumbent priest, with a conscience clause which protected the children from Anglican indoctrination. Ffinden began lessons on the Articles of the Anglican faith, an unwelcome move from the point of view of the Baptists in the village. Darwin withdrew from the committee and cut his annual donation to the church, but continued with the Friendly Society work. Wedgwoods daughter Effie had married Theta Farrer in May, and on 5 August 1873 the Darwins went to visit them for a few days. They arrived to hear that a fortnight previously the Farrers servants had been called to an accident. Earl Granvilles riding companion Wilberforce had been killed in a fall from his horse, and was subsequently laid out in state for two days in the Farrers drawing room. Although an opponent of the Origin, Wilberforce had always thought Darwin a capital fellow.Pause At home, a heated discussion with Hooker ended with Darwin lying in bed with his memory gone and a severe shock continually passing through my brain. Emma feared an epileptic fit, but the doctor put him on a diet and in September he returned to work on insectivorous plants.  His correspondence continued, funding worthy projects and acknowledging countless gifts including Das Kapital from a sincere admirer, Marx, which Darwin had difficulty in following, but hoped that both their efforts towards the extension of knowledge... would add to the happiness of mankind. Frank struggled with his medical studies, and after finishing his thesis on animal tissues he was to assist with plant tissues at Downe.  Georges legal career had been ended by stomach illness and he had spent two years going to spas. He began writing topical essays, the first in the Contemporary Review on Galton. His latest essay boldly dismissed prayer, divine morals and future rewards & punishments. Darwin urged him not to publish it for some months, and to pause, pause, pause. Fiske During a visit in November 1873 the Harvard philosopher John Fiske amused the X Club with his story of a cockney in York warning him What, that orrid hold hinfidel Uxley? Why, we dont think hanythink of im in Hingland! We think es orrid!, himself writing that I am quite wild over Huxley... what a pleasure to meet such a clean-cut mind! It is like Saladins sword which cut through the cushion. and Old Darwin is the dearest, sweetest, loveliest old grandpa that ever was. And on the whole he impresses me with his strength more than any man I have seen yet. There is a charming kind of quiet strength about him and about everything he does. He isnt burning and eager like Huxley. He has a mild blue eye, and is the gentlest of gentle old fellows. his long white hair and enormous white beard him very picturesque... guileless simplicity... I am afraid I shall never see him again, for his health is very bad. Of all my days in England I prize today the most.New edition of The Descent of Man Darwin tackled a new edition of the Descent of Man, and offered the self-financing Wallace the work of assisting him. Wallace quoted seven shillings an hour, mentioning that he was dipping into politics proposing nationalisation of coal mining. Emma found out and had the task given to their son George, so Darwin had to write apologetically to Wallace, adding I hope to Heaven that politics will not replace natural science. Parish reading room For two years, Emma had organised a winter reading room in the local school for local labourers, who subscribed a penny a week to smoke and play games, with Respectable newspapers & a few books... & a respectable housekeeper..there every evening to maintain decorum. This was a common facility to save men from resorting to the house. In 1873 the Revd. Ffinden opposed it, as Coffee drinking, bagatelle & other games had been allowed and the effects of tobacco smoke & spitting were seen when the children returned in the morning. Emma got Darwin to get the approval of the education inspectorate in London, and just before Christmas 1873 the Darwins and Lubbocks got the agreement of the school committee, offering to pay for any repairs needed to afford every possible opportunity to the working class for self improvement & amusement. A furious Ffinden huffed that it was quite out of order for the Darwins to have gone to the inspectorate behind his back. In the autumn of 1874 Darwin let off steam at Ffinden and formally resigned from the school committee on health grounds.Spiritualism Galton was attracted to Modern Spiritualism movement. On a visit to London in January 1874 Darwin attended a sance at Erasmuss house with relatives including Wedgwood, as well as Huxley. George had hired the medium Charles Williams, and they sat round the table in the dark, but as the room grew stuffy Darwin went upstairs to lie down, missing the show, with sparks, sounds and the table rising above their heads. While Galton thought it a good sance, Darwin later wrote The Lord have mercy on us all, if we have to believe such rubbish and told Emma that it was all imposture and it would take an enormous weight of evidence to convince him otherwise. At a second sance Huxley and George found that Williams was nothing but a cheat, to Darwins relief. Emma told Hensleighs daughter Snow that Charles wont believe it, he dislikes the thought of it so much. Snow remembered that her uncle used to look upon it as a great weakness if one allowed wish to influence belief and when Emma said that he does not always act up to his principles Snow thought that was what one means by bigotry, to which Emma said Oh yes, he is a regular bigot.New edition of Descent Darwin continued painfully rewriting his books with the help of Henrietta and George, incorporating ideas from Galton and new anecdotes. He bought from Lubbock the Sandwalk he had been renting for years, but the price seemed excessive and affected their friendship. News of a dispute involving the removal of Bentham from presidency of the Linnean Society, allegedly spurred on by Owen, led Darwin to write What a demon on earth Owen is. I do hate him. With Huxleys assistance he updated the Descent on ape-brain inheritance, which Huxley thought pounds the enemy into a jelly... though none but anatomists would know it.  The manuscript was completed in April 1874, and the publisher John Murray planned a 12 shilling half-price edition to replicate the success of the cheap revision of the Origin. Darwin left the proofs to George, and turned again to Plants. The new edition was published on 13 November with the price cut to the bone at 9 shillings. Insectivorous plants right|thumb|Figure 1 from Insectivorous Plants.During 1874 Darwin contacted many of his old friends to assist with experimentation on insectivorous or plants. Helpers included Hooker and his assistant Thiselton-Dyer at Kew, Burdon-Sanderson at College London running lab tests on the plants digestion, and Gray at Harvard. Enquiries to Nature magazine brought in sacks of mail to be dealt with by Frank, who settled into Brodie Inness old house in the village and married Amy Ruck on 23 July. At this time the family was joined by Romanes who had been a student with Frank at Cambridge. Plants experimented on were members of the genera Drosera and Pinguicula, including D. rotundifolia and P. vulgaris.Controversy with Mivart As well as working on the proofs, George Darwin made a statistical analysis of first cousin marriages (three times more frequent in our rank than in the lower) and, influenced by Galton, published an article on beneficial restrictions in marriage.  Mivart attacked this anonymously in the Quarterly Review, misinterpreting advocacy of divorce in cases of criminality or advice as  the most oppressive laws, and the encouragement of vice in order to check population, talking of hideous sexual criminality. A furious Darwin told George to take legal advice while he contacted the publisher of his books and the Quarterly, John Murray, threatening to take his business elsewhere. Darwins holiday at Southampton with William was overshadowed as he drafted Georges response. Tyndalls address to the British Association later that month laid claim to wrest from theology the entire domain of cosmological theory and led to calls for his prosecution for blasphemy. Lyell, now nearly blind and in deteriorating health, wrote to Darwin applauding the boost to you and your theory of evolution despite his qualms about the hereafter. Darwin was sympathetic, but did not feel any innate conviction of life after death. The October issue of the Quarterly carried Georges response and an apology from Mivart which still maintained that the doctrines... are most dangerous and pernicious and infuriated Darwin. On 13 November Hookers wife Fanny died suddenly, and a devastated Hooker felt unable to return home after the funeral and brought his family to Downe. Emma looked after the children, and when Hooker returned to Kew, Darwin urged hard work to overcome his utter desolation. Later, Darwin mentioned the Mivart argument and Hooker rallied the X Club (a dining club formed in November 1864 to support the evolutionary new reformation in naturalism, including Huxley, Hooker, Tyndall, Busk, Spencer, and Spottiswoode). Huxley eagerly used a review to attack anonymous slander, telling Darwin that he ought to be like one of the blessed gods of Elysium, and let the inferior deities do battle with the infernal powers. Mivart confidentially pleaded to make amends, but Huxley told Darwin that the most effectual punishment was to give him the cold shoulder. Darwin was itching to speak his mind, and when no apology had come by 12 January 1875 he wrote vowing never to communicate with Mivart again.Insectivorous Plants, parish and vivisection Darwin struggled on, by February 1875 telling George that I know full well the feeling of life being objectless & all being vanity of vanities, and Hooker that he was even ready to commit suicide. The death of Lyell on 22 February had him feeling as if we were all soon to go. Their friendship had cooled after Lyell declined to back natural selection, and Darwin pleaded illness rather than take part as a pall-bearer at the funeral in Abbey. In March Darwin took the proofs of Plants to Murray. For a year the vicar had refused to speak to any of the Darwins, and when two evening lectures were proposed for the village, Lubbock had to act as an intermediary in requesting use of the schoolroom. The committee agreed, but Ffinden refused to co-operate, writing that I had long been aware of the harmful tendencies to revealed religion of Mr. Darwins views, but.. I had fully determined.. not to let my difference of opinion interfere with a friendly feeling as neighbours, trusting that Gods grace might in time bring one so highly gifted intellectually and morally to a better mind. Darwin was equally haughty in return, condescending that If Mr. F bows to Mrs D. and myself, we will return it. He found that dealing with Mivart and Ffinden was increasing his private hostility to Christianity. Darwins daughter Henrietta at first supported a petition drawn up by Power Cobbe demanding anti-vivisection legislation. Though Darwin was an animal lover and had never carried out vivisection, he persuaded her that Physiology can only progress by experiments on living animals. During his spring break in London he took the matter up with his contacts, at first thinking of a counter-petition, then on Huxleys advice seeking support lobbying for a pre-emptive bill to provide for regulated vivisection with what he called a more humanitarian aspect. The hint to the fox-hunting houses of parliament that a ban could lead to further restrictions helped, and though Cobbes bill reached the of Lords on 4 May 1875 a week before the scientists bill reached the House of Commons, the Home Secretary announced a Royal Commission of inquiry to resolve the arguments, with Huxley co-opted on to the Commission. The demand for Darwin as an author was shown when Insectivorous Plants, a 450 page catalogue of plant experiments, sold out quickly and in July a 1,000 copy reprint sold out within a fortnight.Variation revised Now Darwin turned to work on a new edition of Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication incorporating additions from the hundreds of letters and scores of monographs that had been sent to Darwin in the seven years since it had been published. Parts were altered or discarded, and Romanes set aside work on jellyfish to graft vegetable plants in experiments aimed at finding out about the gemmules which Darwin thought formed the mechanism of inheritance of characteristics. Investigations into pangenesis by Galton had tried blood transfusions between different breeds of rabbits without success. Darwin continued to look for proof of inheritance of acquired characteristics, amassing evidence of blacksmiths children being muscular and babies born with scars matching those of their parents. He would not follow Huxley in discarding these ideas, and Descent had presented such inheritance as a significant factor in human evolution.Darwin had long been concerned that his children could have inherited his weaknesses. He was proud that Frank seemed to have inherited his interest in natural history, coming to House from the village to carry out plant experiments, and put his son up for a Fellowship of the Linnean Society.Cross and Self FertilisationWith Variation at the printers and with his old essay on The Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants due out in November 1875 with illustrations... drawn by my son, George, Darwin wrote The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom. This drew on a painstaking series of experiments, protecting the plants from insects and controlling the pollination of flowers, counting the seeds and checking them for fertility, repeated for up to ten generations with detailed records kept at every stage. Darwin tabulated the results, Galton checked his statistics, and they found the crossed plants significantly superior to self-fertilised ones in height, weight, vigour and fertility. The same principle would apply to people, and though the attempt to get a question on the census had failed, George analysed data from lunatic asylums and the Pall Mall Gazette which Darwin cited as showing a small effect produced by first-cousin marriages. While Emma ensured that he took short breaks, Darwin pressed on with work as my sole pleasure in life and finished the first draft of Fertilisation in May 1876, promptly going on to a revision of Orchids. Recollections They visited Hensleigh and Fanny to celebrate the announcement that Franks wife Amy was five months pregnant, and Charles and Emma would shortly become grandparents. Darwin decided to leave a posthumous memoir for his family, and on Sunday 28 May 1876 he began Recollections of the Development of my mind and character. He found this candid private memoir easy going, covering his childhood, university, life on the Beagle and developing work in science. A section headed Religious Belief opened just before his marriage, and frankly discussed his long disagreement with Emma. (see Darwins views on religion) He recalled Annie and thought of how, but for her untimely death, she would now have grown into a delightful woman... Tears still come into my eyes, when I think of her sweet ways. He completed his memoir on 3 August, concluding that after his book on fertilisation was published, my strength... will probably be exhausted. On 7 September the baby, named Bernard, was born at Down House, but his mother suffered a fever and convulsions, and died four days later at the age of 26. Darwin thought it the most dreadful thing, and Frank in a state of shock and grief moved into Down House with the baby. The contractors were brought in to extend the house for him, and Frank carried on with mechanical chores for his father, making a fair copy of the memoir and correcting proofs of Orchids. LiberalismDespite Ffindens continuing opposition, Emmas project of a parish reading room for labourers was restarted and opened before Christmas. Darwin saw Orchids and Cross and Self Fertilisation published as he wrote his next book on flowers. In February 1877  he attended the George and Dragon in his position as treasurer and persuaded the village labourers, who were suffering from wage cuts and a threat to their jobs in a farm slump, not to disband the Friendly Society and take the proceeds, but to keep some protection for their longer term security by keeping the books open while distributing their surplus funds. His old Whig principles fitted well with the Self-Help philosophy of another Murray author, Smiles, who had impressed Darwin.As a thorough Liberal, Darwin supported Gladstone, the Grand Old Man of British politics. Three months earlier Darwin had backed the outcry against the Bulgarian horrors when 15,000 (Christian) Bulgarian rebels were massacred by Muslim Turkish troops of the Empire, and supported Gladstones calls for Russian intervention in opposition to the Tory governments support for the Turks. Marx thought this a hypocritical preference for a Christian oppressor, and complained about Darwins support for the piggish demonstration. On 10 March Gladstone, while doing the rounds of his backbenchers and visiting Lubbock, turned up with his entourage at Down House and for two hours regaled a silent Darwin with comments from his latest pamphlet on Turkish terrorism, and launched forth his thunderbolts with unexhausted zest. Before leaving he asked Darwin if evolution meant that the future belonged to America as the Eastern civilisations decayed; after thinking it over, Darwin responded Yes. Watching Gladstones erect alert figure walking away, he said What an honour that such a great man should come to visit me! A fortnight after Gladstones visit, the leading secularist, militant atheist and unofficial Liberal candidate Bradlaugh with co-publisher Besant caused public outrage by publishing do-it-yourself contraceptive advice from an American doctor, Knowlton, in a sixpenny pamphlet Fruits of Philosophy. Bradlaugh and Besant were accused of obscenity and committed for trial on 18 June 1877. A fortnight beforehand they subpoenaed Darwin for their defence, expecting his support. Appalled, he wrote protesting the great suffering this would put him to, and advised that he would have to denounce the defendants as he had long held an opposite opinion on birth control, as evidenced by an extract from the Descent of Man stating that our natural rate of increase, though leading to many and obvious evils, must not be greatly diminished by any means. The practice of contraception would spread to unmarried women & would destroy chastity on which the family bond depends; & the weakening of this bond would be the greatest of all evils to mankind.Holidays The subpoena was dropped, and Darwin was not held back from holidaying at Hill and Southampton for his much needed rest which, as usual, meant working furiously away from home. He visited Stonehenge for the first time, examining how worm castings had buried the megaliths over time. Emma feared that the day-trip involving two hours train journey and a 24 mile drive would half kill him, but he was in wonderful form even after digging in the hot sun. In mid July 1877 his work on the sex life of plants culminated in the publication of The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species, dedicated to Gray. He could not endure being idle and turned to his next book, on plant movement. Emma got him away for his autumn break to Abinger on the Downs, and though Wallace now lived only a few miles away, Darwin avoided him, diplomatically writing that he wished to come over to see you, but driving tires me so much that my courage failed. Honorary Doctorate The of Cambridge had come round to Darwinism, and on Saturday 17 November the family attended the Senate House for a ceremony in which Darwin was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws in front of crowds of students, who strung a cord across the chamber with a monkey-marionette which was removed by a Proctor then replaced by a missing link, a beribboned ring which hung over the crowd through the ceremony. Darwin entered to a roar of approval. The Public Orator gave his panegyric describing Darwins work with purple Latin prose, to some good humoured heckling from the students, and distanced the dignitaries from the unlovely tribe of apes saying Mores in utroques dispares &ndash; the moral nature of the two races is different. Emma had a headache, so she and Darwin let their boys to stand in for them at a dinner in his honour at which Huxley chided the university for failing to honour Darwin twenty years earlier. On the Sunday, after a brilliant luncheon with George at Trinity College, they were given guided tours. The engineering professor James Stuart showed Emma and Darwin round his workshop and later wrote of A strong.. looking man with iron grey hair..though rough hewn from a rock with a heavy..hammer,.. A man of genius.. indeed one of the few. Romanes Into the spring of 1878 Darwin and Frank again filled the house with experiments on the movement of plants. To Frank it was as if an outside force were compelling him, and in March the strain brought back his old sickness of attacks of dizziness. Dr. Clark in London prescribed a dry diet which helped, and refused to charge his patient so Darwin sent 100 towards the development of a fungus-proof potato by a highly respectable Belfast breeder. He also responded to an appeal asking the Beagles officers for help in supporting an orphan &ndash; the grandson of Button. Romanes had become Darwins leading protg, but a conflict between his reasoned scepticism and earlier longing for faith came to a head when his sister died. His attempt to get solace from a leading spiritualist came to nothing. Darwin invited Romanes to Downe to help him recover. Romanes had earlier written a refutation of theism, and had taken Darwins advice to pause, but now wanted to publish. Darwin counselled anonymity, and suggested study of the evolution of religious reasoning, giving him unused notes on instinct from his work on Natural Selection. Romanes launched on the study of comparative psychology, and in August was given a standing ovation for his talk at the British Association. In November the Darwins were staying with the Litchfields, and Romanes drove there to introduce his fianc and present his new book, A Candid Examination of Theism by Physicus. Darwin read it with very great interest, but was unconvinced.Biography of Erasmus Darwin The German scientific periodical Kosmos featured, as a 70th birthday tribute to Charles Darwin, an essay by Krause on his grandfather Darwin. In March 1879 he arranged for it to be translated as a book to which he would add a biographical preface. This would counter Samuel Butlers Evolution Old and New in which the previously supportive, though unscientific, author of Erewhon had turned against Darwinism, and he sent a copy of it to Krause. In the summer he became bogged down with the proofs of his preface about Erasmus, and Henrietta edited out controversial points. The publisher John Murray was satisfied, but Darwin vowed never again to be tempted out of my proper work. Although he tired more quickly now, Darwin still worked for several hours a day. Emma ensured he took holidays, in autumn 1879 joining the Litchfields for a month in the District where he met with Ruskin, though this was not a meeting of minds. On return the Darwins were visited by Haeckel whose roaring about the freedom of science had Darwin retreating to his plants. Darwin unsuccessfully tried to get government support for the Belfast potato breeder from the Permanent Secretary, Theta Farrer (Effie Wedgwoods husband). Farrer was more concerned that his daughter by his first marriage wanted to marry the unsuitable sickly Darwin. Despite her fathers opposition the young couple prevailed, with Darwin giving his son 5,000 of railway stock and assuring Farrer that Horace would have a suitable inheritance. The wedding took place on 3 January 1880, with the families not on speaking terms. Samuel Butler In Evolution Old and New Samuel Butler claimed that earlier evolutionists had correctly seen the mind as controlling evolution, and Mivart told Owen that he thought the book would help to burst the bubble of Natural Selection. Krauses Erasmus Darwin countered this, and Butler took affront at Darwins preface which said that Krauses essay predated Butlers book, when it clearly had passages written later. Darwin had to admit that Krause had revised his essay, and spent a week in February 1880 drafting responses, then was persuaded to ignore the dispute, writing to Huxley I feel like a man condemned to be hung who has just got a reprieve. Butler took the silence as a tacit admission of guilt.Coming of Age Huxley titled his Royal Institution talk The Coming of Age of the Origin of Species, celebrating its 21st anniversary, though wrongly claiming that before its publication only catastrophism was accepted. While Darwin (on holiday with the Farrers, now on good terms) was delighted by the press coverage, he was disappointed to find no mention in its text of selection &ndash; even Darwins Bulldog was still not committed to the central plank of his theory. In April, Gladstone defeated the Tories at the general election, delighting Charles and Emma Darwin though not all their relatives, and a buoyant Charles sent a large subscription to Abbots The Index with hearty wishes for success in the good cause of truth and free religion. The Liberal success even got the militant atheist Bradlaugh elected as MP for Northampton, and public controversy about atheism erupted. He was prevented from taking his seat in the House of Commons by procedural requirements of the oath of allegiance, and secularists such as Aveling toured the country leading protests. Aveling had been writing a series on Darwin and his Works in Bradlaughs paper The National Reformer, and Darwin had sent written thanks which he now feared would be published to his shame. In June, after sending Movement in Plants to his publisher John Murray, Darwin visited William and Sarah at Southampton, and he got William to write to Abbot withdrawing the endorsement that had been printed as advertising copy in the magazine: even association with free thought in distant America could damage his respectability.File:Darwin restored2.jpg|thumb|Darwin as photographed by & Fry at House, 1879Worms Darwin again took up his work on worms. As ever, he corresponded widely, encouraging and helping fund research and collecting anecdotes. Emma supported his commitment, saying that if it was a condition of his living, that he should do now work, she was willing for him to die. For their autumn break they visited Horace and Ida in Cambridge, and to spare him the stress of getting between London stations and changing trains Emma arranged a private railway carriage. At Cambridge he showed Emma around the scenes of my early life. In September 1880 he completed the proofs of Movement in Plants, his largest botany book at 600 pages with 196 wood-cuts, sighing I am turned into a sort of machine for observing facts & grinding out conclusions. When on 13 October he got the request he had feared from Aveling, for permission to dedicate the Darwin and his Works articles to Darwin in book format, he declined in a four page letter marked PRIVATE emphasising that he confined his writing to science and avoided aiding attacks on religion.Attacks on Darwins theory continued, and when the official report of a scientific voyage slighted the theory which refers the evolution of species to extreme variation guided only by natural selection he responded in Nature, Can Sir Thomson name any one who has said that the evolution of species depends only on natural selection? and set out multiple causes, including use and disuse of parts. He called Thomsons criticism appropriate to theologians and metaphysicians, and was only stopped by Huxley from using irreverent language.Help for Wallace Wallace was suffering ever-increasing anxiety over funds, and Buckley, Lyells old secretary, pleaded with Darwin to help him find some modest work. Hooker persuaded Darwin it was hopeless, noting that Wallace had lost caste over spiritualism and a 500 bet he had won by proving the world was a globe to a rich flat-earth fanatic who then started litigation which cost Wallace more than the bet had won. When Wallaces best book to date, Island Life, came out in November 1880 Darwin devoted all his attention to getting his friends to sign a testimonial he wrote, then rushed it to Gladstone before the re-opening of Parliament at the start of January and was overjoyed when Gladstone agreed to recommend a civil list pension of 200 a year, backdated six months. As Darwin passed on the good news to Wallace, Emma organised the family accounts so that Charles could distribute the surplus from the years 8,000 investment income to the children. Work on worms Downe was snowed in, and an outbreak of swine fever involved Darwin as magistrate signing orders daily to allow movement of stock. He wrote to Kovalevsky I make sure, but woefully slow progress, with my new book on worms. In late February he visited London, and called on Duke of Argyll, his old opponent. They had a long and awfully friendly discussion, and when Argyll asked if it was not impossible to look at design of orchids without seeing that they were the effect and the expression of Mind?, Darwin looked at him very hard before replying that he could see the overwhelming force this argument might have, but he could no longer accept it. The billiard room at House was now devoted to worm experiments which included Darwin shining different colours of lights at them at night, his sons playing different musical instruments to them, different scents and kinds of food. Other stimuli were ignored, but a bright white light or a touch of breath would make them bolt like rabbits into their burrows. They appeared to enjoy the pleasure of eating showing eagerness for certain kinds of food, sexual passion was strong enough to overcome... their dread of light, and he saw a trace of social feeling in their way of crawling over each others bodies. Experiments showed that they dragged leaves into their burrows narrow end first, having somehow got a notion, however rude, of the shape of an object, maybe by touching it in many places with a sense like a man... born blind and deaf and a rudimentary intelligence. By mid march he was writing the final chapters of what he told Carus would be a small book of little moment. I have little strength & feel very old. He wrote to Times about the anti-vivisection cause, accusing it of committing a crime against humanity by holding back the progress of physiology, then commented that we ought to be grateful to worms, which reached a depth of five or six feet even here at Down where he expected to be buried shortly.No heart or strength Before Easter he sent off his manuscript for Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms, and found he had no heart or strength... to begin any investigation lasting for years. Never happy except when at work, he was at a loose end until he remembered his autobiography. On 22 April 1881, exactly 30 years after Annies burial, he re-read the passages about her and Emmas letter of that time, and added a note under his daguerreotype of Annie, When I am dead, know that many times, I have kissed & cryed over this. sic. He left the proofs of Worms to Frank and, despondent, turned down Gladstones invitation to become a Trustee of the British Museum. Early in June 1881 Emma and the Litchfields took him to the District, together with William and young Bernard. The sky was like lead and an attempt at climbing brought spots before his eyes and a doctors diagnosis that his heart condition was precarious. He wrote to Hooker that Illness is downright misery to me... I cannot forget my discomfort for an hour and must look forward to Down graveyard as the sweetest place on earth.The Creed of Science Then he was perked up by the 400 page The Creed of Science by the Irish philosopher William Graham arguing the validity of traditional beliefs in the face of materialism. Darwin wrote to Graham expressing doubts about the conclusions  The chief one is that the existence of so-called natural laws implies purpose. I cannot see this. He was swayed by one  You have expressed my inward conviction.. that the Universe is not the result of chance, but then qualified this by his horrid doubt that such beliefs might have arisen as the human mind evolved, and were no more to be trusted than the convictions of a monkeys mind, if there are any convictions in such a mind. He still supported natural selection as the engine of social progress, pointing out that The more civilised so-called Caucasian races have beaten the Turkish hollow in the struggle for existence and telling Graham that elimination of lower races by higher civilised races was inevitable in the progress of Malthusian struggle.()() Back at Downe, a letter from Wallace promoted the socialist ideas of Georges Progress and Poverty proposing to make land common property as morally just. The landowner Darwin responded that such books had a disastrous effect on his mind, he hoped that Wallace would not turn renegade to natural history while adding that I have everything to make me happy and contented.Pleasant memories To Hooker he wrote of Pleasant memories of long past days... many a discussion and... a good fight. Hooker valued their arguments as iron sharpeneth iron and, longing to throw off the trammels of official life and retire from Kew, found it difficult to resist the pessimist view of creation, but when I look back... to the days I have spent in intercourse with you and yours, that view takes wings to itself and flies away. That summer Darwin was in his happiest spirits, chatting deliciously for hours and in the evenings asking for Bach and Handel to be played repeatedly. Romanes, visiting with his wife and baby, thought the old man as grand and good and bright as ever. Darwin stayed with Erasmus while his portrait was painted by John Collier and on 3 August dined by special invitation with the of Wales, the Crown Prince of Germany and eminent physicians at the start of the Seventh International Medical Congress. Later, Erasmus became gravely ill and died on 26 August, and at the funeral at Downe on 1 September Charles, looking old and ill, was a picture of sad reverie. Subsequently Darwin inherited half Erasmuss estate. William announced that this made Darwins wealth over a quarter of a million pounds, without mothers fortune, and Darwin redrafted his will. He sent a note to his sister Caroline about her half of Erasmuss estate, enclosing a miniature of their mother and commenting that he could not remember her face, though he did recall her black velvet gown and the death scene. A requested visit from the eminent but atheist German Doctor Bchner in company with the notorious Aveling went amiably on Thursday 28 September with Darwin introducing his old friend the Revd. Brodie Innes, and defending agnosticism (see Darwins views on religion). Worms was published in October 1881 and within weeks thousands had been sold. It brought a flood of letters, with many idiotic enquiries, and a worn out Darwin escaped with Emma to visit Horace and Ida in Cambridge.Roots and illness Darwin, quite set up, returned to his experiments on plant roots standing in an ammonia solution, preparing sections and looking for physiological division of labour through his microscope. In London he made an unannounced visit to the house of Romanes on 15 December. Romanes was absent, and Darwin declined the concerned butlers invitation to come in. He crossed the street, stumbled and clutched the railings before getting a cab. The next morning Dr, Clark pronounced him fine, but Emma kept him indoors and he was visited by eminent scientists. He seemed bright and animated, but told the geologist Judd that he had received his warning. Once home, this did not hold him back from working hard at his root cells, as well as still doing his walks round the Sandwalk, receiving visitors and dealing with letters. In one he argued with an American feminist that women are inferior intellectually. In February he was miserable to a strange degree with a cough. On 7 March 1882 he had a seizure while on the Sandwalk 400 yards from the house and struggled back to collapse in Emmas arms. Dr. Clark diagnosed angina and prescribed morphine pills for the pain. Darwin lay prostrate in despair, then a younger doctor, Dr. Norman Moore, assured him that his heart was only weak and within days Darwin was back at work, writing to Nature about beetles. Having company helped. Henrietta brought her friend Laura Forster (aunt of M. Forster), herself making a rapid recovery from illness. Darwin daily told Laura of his symptoms and feelings. One day he came out into the garden and, putting his arms round Emma, said Oh Laura, what a miserable man I should be without this dear woman. Another afternoon he joined her in the drawing-room and said The clocks go dreadfully slowly, I have come in here to see if this one gets over the hours any quicker than the study one does. Emma wanted a quiet Easter, so Laura and Henrietta left on 4 April, but on the 4th and 5th Darwin suffered attacks, noting much pain. He recorded his own symptoms, and continued to note sporadic attacks. He took capsules of nitrite, an antispasmodic, and was attended by Dr Moore and a local physician, Dr. Allfrey.() On the 10th, George arrived back from the Indies, and though Darwin was not up to talking for very long, he enjoyed Georges news. Emma remembered how Darwin was gracious & tender when being attended for his illness, and would say It is almost worth while to be so to be nursed by you.( George helped Frank and Jackson (the butler) to carry Darwin to and from his bed. On the nights of 11 and 12 April, Darwin had excruciating attacks of pain. On Saturday 15 April they were visited by the Lichfield family. Darwin joined them for dinner but had a giddy attack and fell down, and had to retire early. He did better on the Sunday, and on Monday was well enough to walk, supported on both sides, as far as the orchard.(Death Darwin seemed fully up to the average, so on Tuesday 18 April the Lichfields left and George went to Cambridge. Darwin stayed up late later than usual in the evening, chatting to Bessy. Just before midnight he again had agonising pain, and woke a flustered Emma to ask for the nitrite. She  had difficulties finding it at first, and with the assistance of Bessy gave him brandy.() Emma later noted that he had woken her saying I have got the pain & I shall feel better or bear it better if you are awake. He had taken the antispasmodic twice, and afterwards said I am not the least afraid of death- Remember what a good wife you have been to me - Tell all my children to remember how good they have been to me.()Dr Allfrey attended and gave some relief, then after he left at 8 a.m. Charles began violent vomiting, after two hours gasping If I could but die repeatedly. Frank and Henrietta returned to join Bessy, who persuaded a worn out Emma to take an opium pill and rest. Charles woke in a daze, recognised his children and embraced them with tears.( Emmas notes state that after the worse of the distress he said I was so sorry for you  but I could not help you... there never were such good nurses as you Francis & Henrietta  Where is Mammy, and when told she was lying down, I am glad of it... Dont call her I dont want her, and often Its almost worth while to be sick to be nursed by you.(He suffered more bouts of nausea and pain, then at 3.25 p.m. groaned I feel as if I should faint. Emma was called and held him as he suffered excruciating pain, then lost consciousness and died at 4 p.m. on Wednesday 19 April 1882.( Dr Allfrey signed the death certificate which gave Angina Pectoris Syncope as the cause of death.() Frank brought Bernard from the nursery to the garden. As they walked past the drawing-room window Bernard noticed his aunts and said Why are Bessy and Etty crying? because Grandpa is so ill? Grief stricken, Frank eventually said Grandpa has been so ill that he wont be ill any more. They reached the Sandwalk and Bernard gathered a bouquet of wild lilies.( Funeral Arrangements were made for burial in St. Marys churchyard at Downe, with Brodie Innes offering to perform the rites, and the customary black edged letters were sent out to friends, relatives and colleagues. In London Galton got Spottiswoode as President of the Royal Society to telegraph the Darwins asking if they would consent to burial in Abbey, an honour that Darwin had been glad to see given to Lyle in 1875. They told Hooker, Lubbock and Huxley who with Spottiswoode met the Revd. Farrar, Canon of Westminster. Farrar suggested a petition to overcome any objections to an agnostic being buried in the Abbey, and approached the Revd. Granville Bradley, Dean of Westminster. Lubbock took up a petition in the House of Commons stating that it would be acceptable to a very large number of our countrymen of all classes and opinions that our illustrious countryman Mr. Darwin should be buried in Westminster Abbey. It was very influentially signed. Newspapers took the request up, sending a public plea to Emma and the children to consent, as foreign tributes poured in. The Standard maintained that true Christians can accept the main scientific facts of Evolution just as they do of Astronomy and Geology, Times declared the 1860 debate was ancient history and the Daily News said that Darwins doctrine was consistent with strong religious faith and hope.Hurried arrangements were made, and Emma saw it nearly settled. It gave us all a pang not to have him rest quietly by Eras &ndash; ; but William felt strongly, and on reflection I did also, that his gracious & grateful nature would have wished to accept the acknowledgement of what he had done. While her children and relatives attended the funeral, she stayed at Downe.The Downe tradesmen were disappointed, the publican pointing out that it would have helped the place so much, for it would have brought hosts of people down to see his grave. The joiner had made his coffin just the way he wanted it, all rough, just as it left the bench, no polish, no nothin, but this was returned and replaced by one you could see to shave in. He added that They buried him in Westminster Abbey, but he always wanted to lie here, and I dont think hed have liked it. That Sunday, Church sermons praised Darwin, saying Natural Selection was by no means alien to the Christian tradition (if interpreted correctly) and seeking a reconciliation between Faith and Science. On Tuesday there was a massive demand for admission cards to the funeral.All day on Tuesday the hearse was drawn by four horses the 16 miles from Downe to Westminster in cold drizzling rain. Next morning the Abbey filled with mourners including international dignitaries and scientists. At mid day on Wednesday  26 April 1882 the full pomp of a state occasion began. The service included a specially commissioned hymn, Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and getteth understanding. William felt a cold draught and, in front of the nation, put his black gloves on top of his bald head for protection. Darwin was buried beneath the monument to Newton, next to Sir Herschel, and as the coffin was lowered, the choir sang His body is buried in peace, but his name liveth evermore.Commemoration Galton proposed a commemorative stained glass window in the Abbey, with panels symbolising the works of nature, each contributed by a different country. The evolution pane did not proceed, but the Royal Society formed a committee which decided on a bronze plaque in the Abbey, and a statue for the new Natural History Museum at South Kensington. Owen remained opposed, and unveiling of the statue had to wait till 1885, after his retirement. The pomp and ceremony was attended by the Prince of Wales, scientists and the family, though not Emma, and led by Huxley. Darwins Westminster Abbey funeral expressed a public feeling of national pride, with the Pall Mall Gazette proclaiming that Great Britain had lost a man whose name is a glory to his country. Religious writers of all persuasions praised his noble character and his ardent pursuit of truth, calling him a true Christian gentleman. In particular the Unitarians and free religionists, proud of his Dissenting upbringing, supported his naturalistic views. Carpenter carried a resolution praising Darwins unravelling of the immutable laws of the Divine Government, shedding light on the progress of humanity. The Unitarian preacher Chadwick from York wrote that The nations grandest temple of religion opened its gates and lifted up its everlasting doors and bade the King of Science come in.NotesReferences**Further reading*Complete Works of Charles Darwin Online  Darwin Online; Darwins publications, private papers and bibliography, supplementary works including biographies, obituaries and reviews.

Sandhog
Sandhog is the slang term given to urban miners, workers who work underground on a variety of excavation projects in York City.() Generally these projects involve tunneling, caisson excavation, road building, or some other type of underground construction or mining projects. The miners work with a variety of equipment from boring machines (TBM) to blasting a path for the project they are building. The term is a US-American colloquialism. Starting with their first job in 1872, the Bridge, the hogs have built a large part of the City of New York -- the subways and sewers, Water Tunnels #1 & #2 as well as the currently under construction Water Tunnel #3, the Lincoln, Holland, Queens-Midtown, and Brooklyn-Battery tunnels to name a few, as well as the foundations for most of the bridges and many of the skyscrapers in the city. Since their work is mostly done below street level, in an unseen world of rock, sand, and earth, recognition of their achievements has been limited. Many of these workers are Irish or American and West Indian.Sandhogs are diverse in backgrounds, interests, and personalities, but are generally united in their work. Sandhogging is somewhat of a tradition and is passed down through generations of families; since mining projects span decades, it is not uncommon to find multi-generations of families working together on the same job.()In the October 1997 issue of Esquire magazine, a series of photographs by Allee, with a text accompanyment by Kelly, documents the life and work of the Sandhog. In 2006 at Central Terminal in New York City there was a large-scale photo and video installation about the sandhogs, Sandhog Project, created by artist Gina LeVay.Thomas Kellys 1997 novel about Sandhogs,Payback, was reissued in 2008 as Sandhogs by Soft Skull Press.() On September 7, 2008, History Channel began a series on the sandhogs.()References(External links* New York City Sandhogs Local Union No. 147* Sandhog Project* New York Times interactive feature on Sandhogs* amNew York Video tour of NYCs Water Tunnel No. 3* Sandhogs on the History Channel*  Sandhogs Toughest Job , September 1947, Popular Science

Manhattan,_Colorado
Manhattan is a town located in the foothills of the Mountains in northwestern Larimer County, Colorado, States. The town was founded in 1886 as a mining camp, during the height of the Silver Boom. The town never experienced great prosperity, however, and had largely vanished by the early 20th century. The town was largely dismantled in the 1930s, and virtually nothing remains of it today.HistoryThe early Gold Rush of 1859 had largely bypassed Larimer County, at the northern end of the Range in northern Colorado. However in August 1886 two experienced prospectors of the Fort Collins Mining Company, Isaac R. Blevins and John DuBois, discovered gold in the creeks north of the Poudre. News of the discovery brought a flood of prospectors to the area, and by October of that year, 125 claims had been recorded. The camp had a population of approximately 100, most living in tents. The camp included a hotel, meat market, blacksmith shop, general store, livery stable, and saloon. The Fort Collins Courier reported that month that the area had well-defined veins, with free milling ore containing gold and silver. A test sample brought back to Fort Collins tested nearly 800 USD per ton.Despite the promise of riches, local businessmen in Fort Collins were largely skeptical and reluctant to back further mining enterprises in the area. Nevertheless, by November, enough capital had been raised to begin mining.The following year in 1887, the town population stabilized. The early gold mining operations brought modest success, despite the lack of a lode. Based on initial optimism, a town plat and surveying were completed, with the expectation that the town would soon grow from several hundred to 5,000 and would rival Fort Collins.The inability of the miners to find a rich lode, coupled with the increasing costs as the mines were sunk deeper, severely eroded the profitability of the operations. During the next two years capital was difficult to raise, and the population declined. Transportation was a continuing difficulty, as the town was accessible only by steep roads. Optimism swept the town again in 1890 with the discovery of a vein that assayed 420 USD per ton. The town population grew once again, and a schoolhouse was built with an enrollment of 20 students. The years 1890 to 1892 saw the height of the town.In 1892, with the mines reaching 100 feet in depth, the town suffered its first mining disaster, killing two well-respected miners. In 1893 it was discovered that the gold concentrations were diminishing as the mine shafts deepened. By 1896 many miners were selling their claims, and production and transportation costs were making the remaining operations largely unprofitable. The town population had dwindled to 50 prospectors. An unexpected discovery of gold along a bend in the Poudre River that year again revived the town, and by 1898, the population had risen back to nearly 300. The optimism quickly tapered off, however, and the population declined again, with only small occasional strikes to keep up the hopes of those who remained.  After the promise of a gold strike in 1911 faded, the town was largely abandoned. In 1930, the Conservation Corps set up a camp near the site (by then within the National Forest, erecting several new temporary structures. In 1933, the site was completely dismantled by order of States Forest Service.GeographyThe town is at an elevation of 8474 feet (2583m), at .()  It was four miles north of Colorado, north of the Canyon and west of Red Feather Lakes, about halfway between Elkhorn Creek and Seven Mile Creek, in the valley of a tributary of Elkhorn Creek called Manhattan Creek.References

Walhalla,_Victoria
:Not to be confused with WhyallaWalhalla is a small town in Victoria, Australia, founded as a gold-mining community in early 1863 and at its peak home to around 2,500 residents. Today, the town has a population of fewer than 20 permanent residents, though it has a large proportion of houses owned as holiday properties. It attracts large numbers of tourists and is a major focus of the regional tourism industry.  The towns name is taken from an early gold mine in the area, named for the German hall of fame, the temple (Valhalla from Norse legend).GeographyWalhalla is located in South-East Australia, in the eastern Victorian region of Gippsland, about 180 kilometres from the state capital Melbourne.  It is located in the Dividing Range, in the steep Stringers Creek valley, approximately four kilometres upstream of the creeks junction with the Thomson River.  The area around the town is designated as an historic area, adjoining the Baw National Park.Owing to the confined space in which the town finds itself, the majority of buildings are located along one main street which follows the creek through the valley until it splits into two branches at the northern end of the town centre.  In the late nineteenth century the town also sported a number of suburbs, situated on the mountain peaks above the valley.HistoryDiscovery of goldThe history of Walhalla is closely linked to the history of gold in Victoria. The first gold had been found in Victoria in 1851, leading to the gold rush. By 1859 prospectors had pushed far east of Melbourne into the trackless wilderness of the Dividing Range.  Major gold strikes on the Jordan River encouraged other prospectors to follow the nearby Thomson River in their search for the valuable metal.A group of prospectors who had been exploring in creeks flowing into the Thomson River valley found gold sometime during late December 1862 or early January 1863.  A claim was pegged out and a member of this group, former convict Edward Randel, registered the claim at the outpost town on Bald Hills on 12 January under his assumed name, Edward Ned Stringer.  Although he was presented with a monetary reward of 100 for his discovery, Stringer was unable to capitalise on his finds, dying in September 1863. Although the settlement was soon rechristened Walhalla after an early mine, the creek running through town still bears his name.The rush that inevitably followed news of this find was slowed to some extent by the goldfields remote and inaccessible location, but many miners soon found their way there. In February 1863, John Hinchcliffe discovered an immensely rich quartz reef in the hill just above the creek, which he named Cohens Reef, after a storekeeper at Bald Hills.Mining operationsGold panning and related techniques quickly exhausted all the alluvial (surface) deposits. By late 1863 mining operations began as prospectors sought and then followed the underground veins of gold. At Walhalla this could mean tunnelling into the steep valley walls as well as the more traditional digging downward.The vast majority of gold extraction from Walhalla centred around Cohens Reef, the largest single reef in Victoria.  By 1900 the reef had already produced around 55 tonnes of gold (approximately 1.8 million troy ounces, worth around US$790 million in 2005).  Due to the enormous expenses of underground gold mining, small claims operated by individuals or small groups soon folded, being replaced by large companies such as the Long Tunnel Mining Company.  This company owned the richest mine working the reef, the Long Tunnel, which produced around 13.7 tonnes of gold alone over its operation between the years 1865-1914.The crushing machinery used to extract the gold from the quartz-based ore required large amounts of energy, supplied largely by wood-burning steam engines.  The need for fuel wood led to the hills being denuded for some considerable distance around town, timber tramways bringing freshly cut timber for the boilers.  The associated costs of bringing wood from further and further away were a key factor in the economic problems which eventually ended mining in Walhalla.Boom period: 1863-1900By late 1863 there had been more finds made nearby at Happy-Go-Lucky, three kilometres from Stringers Creek, and at Coopers Creek, where copper was later to be discovered in even greater abundance. By March 1864, Walhalla had a weekly mail service from Toongabbie, and the Walhalla Post Office was opened on 22 August 1864 (known as Stringers Creek until 1868). Happy-Go-Lucky had a post office open from 1865 until 1916, as did Coopers Creek from 1868 until 1893.()The first hotel, the Reefers Arms, was opened in September 1863. In time, there were more than a dozen hotels, breweries and an aerated waters factory. A branch of the Bank of Victoria was opened in September 1865, and a branch of the Bank of Australasia was opened in February 1866. Shopkeepers, publicans and other traders built the town up quickly in support of the rush.By May 1866, the township of Stringers Creek had been surveyed and renamed Walhalla, after one of the most prosperous mines then working. Most of the first lots of township land were sold to the already-resident householders. That year saw a church building was erected for the Wesleyan Church, and establishment of a Police reserve and Court of Petty Sessions. thumb|300px|A reconstruction of a former shop, which now houses a small museum highlighting the Walhalla Chronicle newspaperThe growing number of families in the area saw the Institute and Free Library also serving as a school when it opened in 1867.  Before long, Walhalla could boast fraternal societies, a debating club, and (briefly at least) a chess club, choral union and dramatic club. By January 1870, the Walhalla Chronicle newspaper was being published, and by December of the same year, a two-acre (.8 ha) site had been gazetted for State School No. 957, which had taken its first enrolments in 1868. A self-appointed Council of Ten sought registration as a Borough in 1869, but dissolved without the necessary public support for rating the towns properties before it could accomplish much more than commissioning the construction of the stone retaining wall that still stands today in the centre of town.  A Borough was eventually proclaimed in late 1872, and by 1878 was able to successfully agitate with the state government for the completion of the first section of the present main road from Moe.  By the end of 1879, Walhalla had daily coach services connecting it to the railway line at Moe to the south and to Traralgon to the east, and its isolation had been considerably reduced.thumb|300px|A general store and modern cafThe Long Tunnel Company introduced both electricity (1884) and the telephone (1891) into the mine. Although Walhalla briefly led the world in having two electric street lights in 1884, this service was never extended further into the town. But the community continued to grow, with houses and gardens lining the hillsides along the valley, to a peak population of more than 2,000 with more than that many again living in the surrounding mountain-top suburbs of Maiden Town, Mormon Town and Happy Go Lucky.  Sporting activities such as cricket and football clubs, with a cricket ground being created through levelling the top of a nearby hill as no other flat land was available.Poverty PointThe Italian community made a substantial contribution to the development of Walhalla, working a number of jobs including mine managers, wood cutters and splitters, farmers, miners and mine labourers, merchants and builders. The first Italian residents to settle down in the area came in 1873, when Pietro Bombardieri opened a tram station at the bottom of Little Joe Hill. They quickly proved themselves hardy and resourceful countrymen, particularly with their farming skills, and by 1882 were represented in the towns business community when Anthony Simonin opened the Alpine Hotel. Their two neighbourhoods, one extending along the Long Tunnel Extended tramway to the north, and the other in the southern end of town, peaked around 1910.(.)The wood cutters and splitters among them would set up camp in bark huts in close proximity to the area they were working, and it seems they rarely came into town. Around the turn of the century several of these families took up land at a remote station along the Thomson River to the north west, which was called Poverty Point.End of mining and years as ghost town: 1910-80thumb|300px|Walhalla township in 1910After many years of lobbying from business interests, the Victorian government eventually agreed to the construction of a rail line into town.  The line was completed into Walhalla in 1910, the last of four narrow gauge (2 6) railways built by the Railways.  The small tank engines which operated were 2-6-2 and were interchanged between the four lines. The six remaining locomotives are owned by Billy Railway near Melbournefive of which are preserved and operating. Branching from the main Gippsland line at Moe, the Walhalla line crossed hilly farming country, until it reached the town of Erica where it entered heavily mountainous territory, crossing the Thomson River by means of a large steel and concrete bridge then snaking up Stringers Creek Gorge over a track featuring ledges blasted from sheer rock faces, dry stone walls built rising from the creek bed, and six timber trestle bridges and brackets within the last few hundred metres into town.It was hoped that the railway would bring new life back into the community, however gold mining was already becoming largely unprofitable and the last of the major mines closed in 1914.  With the disappearance of the main industry in town, the bulk of the population soon left. The Shire of Walhalla was incorporated into the neighbouring Shire of Narracan in 1918. One of the railways main uses became the removal of old buildings out of town, with the original railway station being relocated in 1938 to Hartwell in suburban Melbourne.  In 1944 the section from Platina to Walhalla was closed, with the small copper and lime producing settlement of Coopers Creek using Platina as a supply point until the section of line between Platina & Erica closed in 1952.   The service from Moe to Erica continued to service the farming and timber industries of the area, but it gradually decreased in patronage, until it too was closed in 1954. The line was dismantled late in 1958.Until the growth of the tourist industry in the 1970s and 80s, Walhalla continued on as a ghost town for most of the twentieth century.  Several major public buildings including the Mechanics Institute and Star Hotel were destroyed in two fire events in 1944 and 1951 and a number of buildings were destroyed without being rebuilt.  The school closed in 1965 and further fires, floods and neglect slowly chipped away at the remains of the town.Presentthumb|200px|A replica of the original fire station, built 1965 atop Stringers creekSince around 1980, Walhalla has experienced something of a renaissance with a booming tourist industry and the restoration or reconstruction of numerous historical buildings in the town, including the Star Hotel, Mechanics Institute and reconstruction of the ThomsonWalhalla section of the former narrow-gauge railway.Following amalgamation of local government in Victoria in 1994, the Walhalla and Erica/Rawson areas were placed under the control of the distant Baw Baw Shire at Warragul, 80km to the west. Despite the much closer proximity and strong historical, social and economic linkages to the neighbouring Latrobe Valley cities of Moe, Morwell and Traralgon, the then Kennett Liberal/National Coalition Government elected to place Walhalla in Baw Baw.  In 1991, a group of interested parties formed a taskforce to investigate reconstruction of the Walhalla railway as a tourist attraction, something which had been unsuccessfully attempted on at least one other occasion previously.  Work by the newly formed Goldfields Railway commenced in 1993 at the former Thomson Station site, situated next to the Thomson River immediately before the bridge.  With the restoration of the Thomson River Bridge, trains began to take tourists back up the Stringers Creek Gorge, with a temporary terminus being created at Happy Creek due to the need for reconstruction of the timber trestle bridges completing the journey into town.This terminus was the end point for tourist trains from Thomson Bridge from 1996 until 2002, when the line was opened through to the old station site at Walhalla.  The current station building is an exact replica of the original, although the yard layout is considerably different owing to a section of the former stations location having been covered by earlier road deviation works of the main road into Walhalla.In December 1998, Walhalla became the last mainland community in Australia to be connected to the electricity grid,( Historic Walhalla Website) although some other towns do not have electricity yet, such as Licola nearby.Several significant attempts have been made resurrect commercial gold mining in the Walhalla area, with Walhalla Resources and Goldstar Resources investing significant amounts in the 1980s and 2002+ respectively. Both companies hoped to use modern mining techniques to access gold bearing ore that was not economically winnable in the towns gold era. In 2008, GoldStar was well advanced to obtaining a mining licence, but the company folded in early 2009 due to lack of funds, in part caused by the Global Financial Crisis. The company was then refloated as Orion Gold NL with a new management team and has adopted a less aggressive approach to restarting gold mining in and around Walhalla.Walhalla has been impacted by major fire events in 2005, 2006 and 2009 although the town proper has not sustained any damage.Landmarks and tourist informationAs well as historical buildings, the township features many mines and mineshafts and the mountainous terrain is popular with hikers and bushwalkers. It is the starting point for the 650 km Alps Walking Track, which continues to near Canberra. Walhalla also features many camping grounds, although camping is not permitted within 50 m of Stringers Creek, as the water is not fit for drinking.The current railway station is an exact replica built to the Victorian Railways plans of the original station building (now located in the Melbourne suburb of Hartwell), although the interior is different to the original configuration. It is on the opposite side of the station yard from its original location because the main road into Walhalla was widened after the railway closed. Train rides are operated by the Goldfields Railway over the restored section between Walhalla and the Thomson.The Walhalla Fire Station was built straddling Stringers Creek and is now open to the public as a museum. It was totally reconstructed in the early 1960s after many years of neglect and the structure seen today has been rebuilt from the floor up.The Band Rotunda was built at the junction of the left- and right-hand branches of Stringers Creek in 1896, commissioned by the Mountaineer Band, who held a competition for its design. Two hotels were situated opposite the Band Rotunda, the Star Hotel on the north side of the creek fork, and the Grand Junction Hotel on the south side. The original Star Hotel was burnt down in a bushfire in 1952, but reconstructed in 1999 with a recreation of the original facade.The american actor Swayze visited Walhalla in his youth, where he enjoyed exploring the country side and the local history.Windsor House was built by German Johannes Gloz between 1878 and 1888 from around 90,000 handmade bricks, the only brick residence in the town. Gloz maintained a vineyard on the slope above building, producing around 900 bottles of Riesling in the year 1880. The building is currently a and breakfast.Situated on top of the hill immediately to the north-east of the junction of the east and west branches of Stringers Creek is the Cricket Ground, approximately a 45-minute hike from the valley floor. Long Tunnel Extended Mine thumb|200px|The Long Tunnel Mine about 1910Long Tunnel Extended Gold Mine (LTEM) was one of the richest mines of Walhalla. The main gold-bearing reef in Walhalla is called Cohens reef. The LTEM mine was started by Hercules United Gold Co. in 1863. After eight years, the company collapsed after not finding any gold. The mine was then taken over by the Long Tunnel Extended Company in 1871. They looked in the opposite direction and found a remunerating part of the reef. This mine soon became the second most productive mine in the area (after the Long Tunnel) and in total produced 13,695 kg of gold before it closed in 1911. Overall, the Long Tunnel Extended  mine was Victorias fifth largest gold mine during the colonial era.Today it is operated by the Walhalla Board of Management Incorporated on behalf of the people of Victoria as a tourist attraction. Underground tours are conducted daily. The mines 8.5 kilometres of underground workings extended to a depth of 923 metres below the machinery chamber which in turn is some 150 metres below natural surface. The tour takes visitors 300 metres into the huge underground machinery chamber hewn from the solid rock over a century ago. Old mining methods are discussed and a large outcrop of the famous Cohens Line of Reef is exposed in the mine. Notable residents  William Barlow Carkeek, Australian Test Cricketer, was born in Walhalla on 17 October 1878.

Azalai
thumb|right|A camel train traveling from Agadez to Bilma (Niger), 1985.Image:Salt selling Mopti Mali.jpg|thumb|right|Salt at the market in Mopti. After the Azalai reaches Timbuktu, it is taken by boat down to Mopti and from there into Bamako and the rest of Mali. The Salt is for medicinal purposes, home remedies, industrial usage, and for farm animals (depending on the type). It is sold here in slabs (right), broken and weighed (top right), and packaged into smaller amounts for other uses (left).The Azalai (var. Azalay) is a semi annual salt caravan route practiced by Tuareg traders in the Sahara desert, or the act of traveling with a caravan along that route. History In the early 20th century two West African routes were referred to as the Azalai: one from Timbuktu and the Taoudenni salt mines in Mali, the other from Agadez, Niger to Bilma on the Kaouar Oasis, with its salt condensation pits. Both are some of the last caravan routes in the Sahara that are still in use.(Mali - Azalai - URL retrieved July 6, 2008) Both caravans have largely been replaced by unpaved truck routes. Agadez-Bilma The Agadez-Bilma route, passing through the Tnr desert and the oasis town of Fachi, takes around three weeks to complete (both ways). It is traditionally a twice yearly caravan from the capital of the Ar region to the natron salt pans along the string of oases formed by the Kaouar cliffs. Food and supplies were carried from Agadez each November and March and traded for bricks of salt, condensed in the natron pits of oasis towns, and to a lesser extent, dates and vegetables. The salt was then generally traded for animal use in the Hausaland regions to the south.(Decalo, p.41, 133, 134)The Agadez-Bilma Azalai was historically a monopoly of the Tuareg, and successively the Gress, Owey and Ayr confederations in particular. Many Tuareg traders owned the salt pits and date plantations in Kaouar, as well as holding bonded laborers there, and traveled the azalai to administer their property. The Tuareg Azalai, numbering 10,000 camels and stretching 25 km at the beginning of the colonial period, is led by the representative of the Amenokal (confederation leader), followed by each sub group.(Decalo, p.41.)  Pre-colonial history The Camel was introduced into the Sahara in the late first millennium, and Tuareg tribes moved south into the region in the 13th century. In the 18th century, Tuareg confederations captured the Kaouar oases from the Empire and began transporting goods from Agadez.(Decalo, p.133.) Colonial and post-colonial history The disruptions of the French colonial expansion in the first years of the 20th century led to inter clan rivalries, and later, the rise of mechanised traffic. In 1904, Ouled Sliman raiders from what is now Chad destroyed the Azalai at Bilma, and again in 1906 at Fachi. The French reported that the 1906 caravan numbered 20,000 camels. Following the Revolt, no Azalai traveled the route until 1925, and then it was accompanied by French colonial forces. By 1948, the caravans had shrunk to 8000 camels, and continued to shrink thereafter. The northern road route, marked by the of Tnr, has supplanted most camel trains, but small Azalai trains continue to head out each November. In the post colonial era, some Hausa merchants travel the Azalai, calling it by the language name Taglem or Tagalem. Timbuktu-Taoudenni At one time the caravan route from Timbuktu extended through Taoudenni to Taghaza, another salt-mining site, and on to the lands north of the Sahara on the Mediterranean Sea. Caravans with up to 10,000 camels carried gold and slaves north, returning with manufactured goods and salt from Taghaza and Taoudenni.(de Villiers, Marq, and Seila Hirtle. (2007) Space, Time, and Timbuktu. Natural History. 116:6. July/August 2007. ISSN 0028-0712) Until the 1940s, the Taoudenni caravans were made up of thousands of camels, departing Timbuktu at the beginning of the cool season in November, with a smaller caravan departing Timbuktu in March.

rels      Predominantly Islam  Minority ChristianityHinduismZoroastrianismA Pakistani American is any citizen or resident of the States who has Pakistani heritage. History in the United States Muslim immigrants from areas that are now part of Pakistan have been migrating to America and first entered the United States as early as the eighteenth century, working in agriculture, logging, and mining in the western states of California, Oregon, and Washington. The passage of the Act of 1946 allowed these immigrants to acquire U.S. citizenship through naturalization. Between 1947 and 1965, only 2,500 Pakistani immigrants entered the United States; most of them were students who chose to settle in the United States after graduating from American universities, according to reports from the Immigration and Naturalization Service. This marked the beginning of a distinct Pakistani community in America. However after President Johnson signed the Act of 1965 into law, eliminating per-country immigration quotas and introducing immigration on the basis of professional experience and education, the number of Pakistanis immigrating to USA increased dramatically.(Pakistanis in U.S., 2010-05-20.) By 1990, the U.S. Census bureau indicated that there were about 100,000 Pakistani Americans in the United States and by 2005 their population had grown to 210,000.() Racial classification Pakistani Americans are currently classified as Americans by the States Census Bureau.(Data on Race (U.S. Census)) Ethnically, they fit the definition of Asian American, which also includes Indian Americans, Bangladeshi Americans and Sri Lankan Americans. In 1993, the Arab American Institute proposed that the 2000 U.S. Census make a new Eastern racial category, including Pakistani Americans within it, rather than the currently used American category. Because Indo-Aryans, Persians, Turks, Arabs, Huns, Afghans, Greeks, and Mongols have all in one time or another invaded, conquered and settled on what is now the nation of Pakistan, Pakistan has ethnic and cultural diversity.() While Pakistan is not geographically or culturally part of the Middle East, it has been regarded as one of the countries which form the extended definition of Middle East. Demographic The Census Bureau in 2000 estimated that there were 229,306 U.S. citizens of Pakistani descent living in the United States.(Immigrant America - A portrait) The Census Bureau, however, excluded those living in institutions, college dormitories, and other group quarters. Some studies estimate the size of the Pakistani community to be much higher and in 2005 the Pakistan embassies research stated that there were more than 700,000 people.(http://islamabad.usembassy.gov/pr-10061601.html)(http://samaj.revues.org/index55.html) The gap in numbers maybe a result of the U.S. census to count only Pakistani immigrants and exclude those born in the United States between Pakistani parents and those that are second/third generation Americans of Pakistani descent.(Pakistani Migration to the United States: An economic perspective) Pakistan is the 12th highest ranked source country for immigration into the United States.(Pakistan Link - Nayyer Ali)The top 10 states of residence for the foreign-born of Pakistani origin, 2006 and top 10 metro areas of residence for the foreign-born of Pakistani origin, 2006.

Religion figures prominently in the life of Pakistani American families, and the Quran and the teachings of Muhammad serve as the guidelines that Pakistani Muslims are supposed to follow throughout their lives.(The majority of Pakistanis belong to the Sunni sect of Islam, although there is a significant representation of the Shiite sect. In smaller towns in America where there may not be mosques within easy access, Pakistani Americans make trips to attend the nearest one on major religious holidays and occasions.( Pakistani Americans worship at mosques alongside other Muslims who might trace their ancestry to all parts of the Islamic world; there are generally no separate Pakistani American mosques.Pakistani Americans also participate in and contribute to the larger Islamic community, which includes Americans, American, American, Americans, Americans, Asian Americans, and many more ethnic backgrounds in America.( They are part of the larger communitys efforts to educate the country about the ideals of Islam and the teachings of Mohammed. Pakistani Americans have played important roles in the association the Muslim Students of America (MSA), which caters to the needs of Islamic students across the United States.(Although most Pakistani Americans are Muslims, there are also Hindus, Christians, and Zoroastrians within the community. Pakistani Christians, like Asian Christians, worship at churches all over the country and share in the religious life of the dominant Christian culture in America. Pakistani Hindus mainly share in the religious life of numerous Hindus (including large number of American converts) from various nationalities. Pakistani Hindus are mostly from Karachi. In recent times, Pakistani Zoroastrians (called Parsis) have come to the United States mainly from the cities of Lahore and Karachi. Apart from fellow Pakistanis, they also congregate with fellow Zoroastrian co-religionists from Iran. Culture Like the terms Asian American or South Asian American, the term Pakistani American is also an umbrella label applying to a variety of views, values, lifestyles, and appearances. Although Pakistani Americans retain a high ethnic identity, they are known to assimilate into American culture while at the same time keeping the culture of their ancestors. Pakistani Americans are known to assimilate more easily than many other immigrant groups because they have fewer language barriers (English is widely spoken in Pakistan among professional classes), more educational credentials (immigrants are disproportionately well-educated among Pakistanis), and come from a similarly diverse, relatively tolerant, and multi-ethnic society. Pakistani Americans are well-represented in the fields of medicine, engineering, finance and technology. Pakistani Americans have brought Pakistani cuisine to the United States, and Pakistani cuisine has been established as one of the most popular cuisines in the country with hundreds of Pakistani restaurants in each major city and several similar eateries in smaller cities and towns. There are many Pakistani markets and stores in States.  Some of the largest Pakistani markets are in York City, New Jersey, D.C., Chicago, and Houston. Languages Pakistani Americans often retain their native languages. Some examples of these are Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashto, Hindko, Balochi, Kashmiri and Seraiki.() As English is an officially recognized language in Pakistan and is taught in schools throughout the country many immigrants coming to the United States generally have a good grasp of the English language.(Pakistanis in California Pg 2. Retrieved 05-21-2010.) Economics and Education The Pakistani American community today lives in a comfortable middle-class, upper-middle-class(( and wealthy-class lifestyles.(Pakistani American millionaires) Many Pakistani Americans follow the residence pattern set by others that when they increase their wealth, they are able to own their own businesses; including restaurants, groceries, clothing and appliance stores, newspaper booths, and travel agencies. It is common to include members of the extended and immediate family in the business. The Pakistani American community is said to be philanthropic, research shows that in the year 2002 the community gave close to US$ 1 Billion in philanthropic activities (including value of volunteered time).( An increasing number of Pakistani Americans work in the medical field. The Association of Physicians of Pakistani Descent of North America, APPNA, has been meeting in various locations across the States for the past 30 years. There are more than 15,000 doctors practicing medicine in America who are from Pakistani decent.(http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/356/5/442) Pakistan is the fourth highest source of IMG doctors in the U.S.(http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/international-medical-graduates/imgs-in-united-states/imgs-country-origin.shtml) and they are chiefly concentrated in York, California, Florida, Jersey and Illinois.(http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/18/img-workforce-paper.pdf) They are also the fourth highest source of foreign dentists licensed in the United States.(Foreign-trained dentists licensed in the United States Retrieved 08-07-2011)Pakistani Americans tend to follow the residence pattern set by other Americans, in that they move to more affluent suburbs as their prosperity and wealth increases. Members of the community believe in the symbolic importance of owning homes; accordingly, Pakistani Americans tend to save money and make other monetary sacrifices earlier on in order to purchase their own homes as soon as possible.( Members of the family and the larger community tend to take care of each other, and to assist in times of economic need. Hence, it would be more common to turn to a community member for economic assistance rather than to a government agency. This leads to relatively low levels of Pakistani-Americans on welfare and public assistance.( According to the 2000 census the mean household income in the United States in 2002 was $57,852 annually, whereas for Asian households, which includes Pakistanis this was $70,047.(  A separate study conducted by the American Community Survey in 2005, showed the mean and median incomes for Pakistani male full time workers were US$59,310 and US$42,718 - respectively compared to the average male American full time workers mean and median incomes of US$56,724 and US$41,965 - respectively.(There is also incidence of poverty in the Pakistani community and in particular around new immigrants that migrated from less privileged backgrounds. These migrants tend to take low-paying jobs involving manual or unskilled labor and tend to live in large cities where such jobs are readily available and in particular New York, where as of the 2000 census, poverty rates for Pakistanis in relation to the total New York population were higher overall, with 9,417 (28%) of Pakistanis living in poverty, which is greater than the general New York City poverty rate of 21%.(http://www.aafny.org/cic/briefs/pakistani.pdf) Compared with those immigrants that arrived from 1965 who were either professionals or students and considered to be middle and upper class backgrounds, the newer migrants tended to be worse off economically.(New cosmopolitanisms: South Asians in the US)Compared to other heritage groups in the United States, Pakistani Americans tend to be better educated with 87.4% being at least a high school graduate(U.S census bureau educational attainment Retrieved 08-09-2011) and 60.9% holding a bachelors degree or higher professional degree.((Dr. Mehtab Karim, at the Research Center found that 29.5% of Pakistanis completed four years of college, 22.5% completed a Masters in a professional degree while 1.6% acquired a doctorate degree, this compared with the American national average of 17.6%, 20% and 1.1% respectively.(Embracing the American mainstream Retrieved 08-09-2011) Labour The table shows the areas of work that Pakistanis are employed in and compares the persons that are born in the U.S., those born in Pakistan and those that are American nationals:(Asian Americans: contemporary trends and issues)Note: FB1  Pakistani born, NB2  American born Pakistani and NB3  All American nationalsThe York Times estimated that there were 109,300 workers born in Pakistan in all occupations in the US in 2007.

Bush and Bush with Pakistani American Army Sgt. Wasim Khan at the of the Union Address, Capitol building, February 1, 2004. Khan was wounded in action during Iraqi Freedom, June 2003 and was invited as a guest by former President Bush.Muslim immigrants were actively involved in the struggle for residence and citizenship rights in America. Since the second wave of immigration in 1965, the Pakistani American community has not been politically inclined, but this is now changing, with the community starting to contribute funds to their candidates of choice in both parties, and running for elected office in districts with large Pakistani American populations. In recent times, Pakistani American candidates have run for the state senate in districts of such city boroughs as New York. Because the community is geographically dispersed, the formation of influential voting blocs has not generally been possible, making it difficult to for the community to make an impact on politics in this particular way. However, there are increasing efforts on the part of community leaders to ensure voter registration and involvement.  Pakistani Americans have tended to vote Republicans due to the shared ideology of conservatism and the perceived notion that Republican Presidents and leaders are more pro-Pakistani than Democrats. This was evident that during the Presidential Election, as Pakistani Americans voted in overwhelming numbers for Republican candidate W. Bush. However, that trend reversed itself in 2004, after George W. Bushs first term in office. His policies alienated Muslims at home and abroad, and Pakistanis were no exception. When George W. Bush was up for re-election, Pakistani Americans voted for Democratic candidate Kerry. Relations with Pakistan File:Pakistani american rally.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Pakistani Americans protesting in NY against President Musharrafs imposition of emergency rule in November 2007.Pakistani Americans have always maintained a strong bond with their homeland. Several leading airlines fly from US to Pakistan, carrying with them thousands of Pakistanis who mostly go home to visit family and relatives. First-generation Pakistani Americans travel to their native land at least once every two years, and tens of thousands of airplane tickets are sold to Pakistani Americans every year. They often take back to Pakistan gifts of money, food, and clothing for friends and family, and donate generously to charities. Second-generation Pakistani Americans tend to travel to Pakistan less frequently as ties become attenuated. The relationship of the U.S. and Pakistani governments in the past few decades has been very close, and the Pakistani American community has benefited from this American interest in the country of their origin. Pakistani TV channels have found their way into homes of the diaspora worldwide. Several paid TV channels are available for viewing; Pakistani TV serials, reality TV shows and political talk shows are popular among the expatriates. Those without access to TV can also watch the same channels on the internet. Pakistani Americans maintain a deep interest in the society and politics of Pakistan. Funds are raised by the community in America for the different political parties and groups in Pakistan. From all the Pakistani diaspora, Pakistani Americans raised the largest number of funds to help Pakistan due to the Pakistan earthquake. Tensions among ethnic groups like the Sindhis, Punjabis, Pashtuns or Baluchis, in Pakistan are not reflected in interaction between these subgroups in America.Several international airlines serve the growing Pakistani community in US connecting major US airports to those in Pakistan.The Pakistani community in the United States also remits the largest share of any diaspora community since 2002/03, surpassing those from Arabia which from 2000/01 remittances were $309.9 million and increased to $1.25 billion by 2007/08 and during the same period remittances from the USA increased from $73.3 million to $1.72 billion.( Discrimination Incidents of deliberate overt discrimination against Pakistani Americans are few and far in-between. Any discrimination that exists is primarily in the form of being not so welcoming in social interactions, compared to the treatment received, say, by northern European immigrants who are more readily embraced. Though rare, explicit discrimination is not unknown in the Pakistani American community. Since the 11, 2001 attacks, there have been scattered incidents of Pakistani Americans having been mistaken targets for hate crimes and Pakistani Americans have to go under more security checks in places such as airports due to their Muslim background. Up to 45,000 of the estimated 100,000-strong Pakistani community in New York were deported or left voluntarily following the attacks, according to reports.(http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2008/10/20081015181955164424.html)One of the notable case of discrimination is that of Hasan a Princeton University graduate who was deported to Pakistan even when no case was proved against him.

William_W._Thomas,_Jr.
William Widgery Thomas, Jr. (August 26, 1839 &ndash; October 7, 1927) was a States politician from Maine.(Thomas, William Widgery, Jr. (Political Graveyard) )BackgroundHe was born in Portland, Cumberland County, Maine, the son of William Widgery Thomas and Elizabeth White (Goddard) Thomas. A lawyer before entering foreign politics, most notable was his effort to bring Swedish colonists to northern Maine and later founding the community of New Sweden, Maine in 1870. He is also noted for being the last U.S. ambassador to the united kingdoms of Sweden and Norway.(William Widgery Thomas, Jr.  (Thomas Memorial Library))Consular yearsA Republican, Thomas found a love for the people of Scandinavia at an early age. At only 23 years of age, and full of enthusiasm for his task, he was appointed consul to Gothenburg, Sweden on October 23, 1862. Prior to that he had gone as American consul to Galatz in Romania, and after a voyage of four months he reached Gothenburg in the middle of June, 1863. He learned quickly to understand and speak Swedish, and  as consul in the kingdom of Sweden-Norway he laid plans for a large emigration of both Swedes and Norwegians, with the hopes that most would seek new fortunes in his home state of Maine. As he wrote April 5, 1864, for the encouragement of immigration: Besides all other reasons, I believe these honest, pious, plodding Swedes would form an excellent balance to the fickle, merry, light-hearted Irish, who are now crowding in such goodly numbers to our shores.After the war of Schleswig between Denmark and Prussia ended in 1864, Swedish volunteers coming back from Denmark wanted to go to America and continue fighting there in the Civil War. Thomas solved this problem without asking his government for directions. He arranged with the captains of the Hamburg steamers to take these soldiers across the ocean at half price, and together with some friends he made up a little purse with which they could be sent to Hamburg. I am well aware, he reported to the U.S. Department of State, that as consul I can have nothing to do with enlisting soldiers, but no international law can prevent me from paying a soldiers passage from here to Hamburg out of my own pocket. In the course of the following winter Thomas induced more Swedish soldiers to go to America.The same year he had planned to enlarge his propaganda for emigration considerably. He wrote to the Department: I have the honor to ask for a leave of absence from this Consular district, but not from this Kingdom, for three months; my absence to commence about the middle of May next. My design is to visit the mines in the interior of Sweden and Norway, and to see and talk with the people of this country in their own homes. One of the chief objects of my expedition will be to encourage all whom I meet to emigrate to the United States. In every hamlet where I pass the night, at every post-station where I await fresh horses, I shall scatter such information as I have found by experience to be best calculated to promote the emigration of these Scandinavians to our own land. It is my intention on my return to report the results of my expedition to the Department, giving special attention to the subject of immigration, stating what impediments still exist, and the best means of overcoming them. Hon. J. S. Haldeman, Minister Resident at Stockholm, has authorized me to mention that he warmly approves of my intended journey.The Department, too, approved. It granted, on March 26, the leave of absence Thomas had applied for. But when this permission arrived, he was so busy arranging his other plans that he decided to postpone his trip until the next year. Towards the end of June, 1865, he set out on the journey he had planned, taking with him the text of the Act and other documents printed in the language of the country, proposing to sow this good seed broadcast all along his way. In fact, the journey came to embrace Norway almost exclusively. Returning to Gothenburg after several months, he sent his report to the Department of State, an excerpt of it reads:One of the chief objects of my expedition was to diffuse knowledge tending towards emigration, and whether driving over the fjelds, scaling mountains, resting at stations, or coasting along the shore in steamers, I everywhere preached an immigration crusade to the laborers paradise in the New World. I spoke of our homestead law  the fertility of our soil  the length of our summer  the richness of our immense mining districts, but I found nothing so telling as the simple description of the condition and prospects of the working man in the United States of America. Of fifty odd postillions I had along the road, all promised me to immigrate to the United States next Spring, save one; he, I ascertained, had been in England for nine months, and, judging all foreign countries by the one he had visited, concluded, perhaps wisely according to his light, to remain at home. (...) Sometimes some Norwegian proprietors, not liking perhaps the tendency of things, would commence a discussion in presence of the deck-passengers. I found it very easy to refute all their arguments. When driven from every other point they invariably took refuge under the palladium of patriotism  love for Gamle Norge (Old Norway). To this I replied, that I recognized no love of country, not connected with love for our countrymen; if then, as they had been constrained to admit, the Norwegian laborer bettered his condition by immigrating into the United States, true patriotism should assist him to go, not hinder him from going. I however always treated these Norwegian gentlemen personally with the greatest respect. In no case did one discussion descend to altercation, and no unfriendly words were ever used.Thomas estimated a total of 10,000 immigrants that year to the United States from Sweden and Norway, but he was quick to add the numbers would prove rather under than over the truth.Shortly after this propaganda trip through Norway, the consular activities of Thomas came to an end. At the beginning of November, 1865, he received notice from the Department of State that, under the act of Congress, it was not authorized to continue his salary any more. Consequently, he resigned and left for his home state of Maine.Maine politicsIn Maine he became, in 1870, a member of the immigration commission, virtually its leading member, and in that year he went to Sweden, brought a whole colony of Swedes back to America, and founded New Sweden in the northern forests of Maine, where he himself spent the better part of the next four years. He was a member of the Maine State House of Representatives 18731875 and served as Speaker of the Maine State House of Representatives from 1874 to 1875. Also a member of the Maine State Senate in 1879 and delegate to the Republican National Convention from Maine in 1880.Ambassador yearsThomas would return to Scandinavia, serving as American Minister to Sweden and Norway in three separate terms: 1883-1885, 1889-1894 and 1898-1905. Sweden in particular would always remain his great love; he married a Swedish girl, Dagmar Trnebladh, on October 11, 1887 while living in Stockholm, during his first period as minister.Thomas was appointed American Minister for his third and last period on December 18, 1898, until he was recalled on May 31, 1905. In a letter to the U.S. Department of State February 2, 1905, Thomas wrote: A serious crisis for the union of Sweden and Norway seems very imminent. He was commenting on the growing concerns that the Norwegian government was about to renounce the union with Sweden. He added in the letter that he was convinced there wouldnt be a war between the two countries, and personally he hoped the union could be preserved. He continued, in this conviction of peace, lies the greatest hope for every friend of Scandinavia, that the union between these two noble nations in the high north, must be preserved in one form or another. In March 1905 he reported home that the Norwegian government had resigned and a new one would be formed. He noted the new one would probably be composed of members of the extreme left, meaning those who wish for an immediate and radical action in regard to the relationship between Sweden and Norway. This extreme left was now prime minister Michelsen, who to all Norwegians would become the leading symbol of the movement towards dissolution of the unpopular union. Thomas last mission as American Minister ended that spring, he was recalled on May 31, making him in effect, the last US ambassador to the united kingdoms of Sweden and Norway. On June 7, 1905, the union of Sweden and Norway ended, and he would be succeeded by H. Graves.(Bio of William Widgery Thomas Jr. (Representative Men of Maine, a Collection of Biographical Sketches. Portland, Maine: Lakeside Press, 1893))Thomas moved back home to Maine, where in 1915 he married a second time, to another Swede, Aina Trnebladh. In 1919, William Widgery Thomas Jr. donated the Thomas Memorial Library to the Inhabitants of the Town of Cape Elizabeth to be maintained as a free public library forever. Ambassador Thomas died on April 25, 1927 at the age of 87 and was buried at Evergreen Cemetery, Portland, Maine.NotesOther sources*Hede, Richard,  Centennial History of Maines Swedish colony (Stockholm, Me.:  1970)*Malmquist, Marie, Lapptcke (New Sweden, Me.: 1928-9)*Melvin, Charlotte Lenentine, The Swedish People in Northern Maine (typescript, 1950)*Melvin, Charlotte Lenentine, et al., The New Sweden Centennial (Chicago, Ill. : Swedish Pioneer Historical Society, 1970)External links*Thomas Memorial Library Foundation*Maines Swedish Colony

Ludendorff_Bridge
extra         The Ludendorff Bridge (known frequently by English-speakers during World War II as the Bridge at Remagen) was a railway bridge across the River Rhine in Germany, connecting the villages of Remagen and Erpel between two ridge lines of hills flanking the river. Remagen is situated near and south of Bonn.The bridge is notable for its capture on March 78, 1945, by American forces during the Second World War of Remagen, which allowed the Allies to establish a bridgehead across the Rhine.The bridge capture was an important strategic event of WW2 because it was the only remaining bridge over the River into Germanys heartland and was also strong enough that the Allies could cross immediately with tanks and trucks full of supplies. Once it was captured, the German troops began desperate efforts to damage it or slow the Allies use of it. At the same time, the Allies worked to defend it, expand their bridgehead into a lodgement sufficiently large that the Germans could no longer attack the bridge with artillery, and kept it in repair despite the ongoing battle damage.The ensuing engagement continued for more than a week, including a huge artillery duel, a desperate air battle, and scrambled troop dispositions for both sides along the entire defensive front along the River Rhine as both sides reacted to the capture. One effect of those redeployments was that the Allies were able, within a fortnight, to establish other lodgements using bridges in several other sectors of the Rhenish front, again complicating the defense for the Germans and hastening the end of German resistance on their western front.On March 23 the long prepared Plunder, commanded by Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, crossed the Rhine in force to the north near Rees and Wesel(same city) (Rhine-Westphalia).HistoryPre-World War II Under the Plan, a bridge was planned to be built here in 1912, as well as bridges in Engers and Rudesheim. The bridge was designed by Karl Wiener . Work on the bridge pillars and arches was done by by leading construction companies Grn & Bilfingerref>) and Philipp Holzmann with the steel bridge built by MAN (Gustavsburg). It was constructed between 1916 and 1919 with two railway lines and a walkway (during WW2 one railway was covered by planks to allow truck traffic). Russian prisoners of war were used in construction work. The bridge section had a total length of 398 m and had two massive foothills on the left bank vault openings, each 30 m internal diameter. The main part formed a 325.41 m long steel bridge which consisted of the central two-hinged arch bridge, flanked on both sides by parallel anchor arms. The arch span was 156.21m in length and arms each 84.6m. The highest point of the arch bridge was 28.5 m above the ground. The height above the normal water level of the Rhine was 14.80 m. The 4642-ton structure cost about 2.1 million Marks. As the bridge was a major military construction, both abutments of the bridge were provided with the still-preserved fortified bridgeheads. These towers were equipped with loopholes for the bridge crew, stores and accommodation for troops. From the flat roofs there is a wonderful view over the valley.It was named for the German War I general Ludendorff, one of the bridges proponents. It was designed to connect the Right Rhine Railway, the Left Rhine Railway and the Ahrtalbahn  to facilitate transport to the Western Front. It was one of three bridges built to improve railway links between Germany and France during World War I, the other two being the Bridge at am Rhein and Bridge near Koblenz. This was one of the four bridges guarded during the United States Army occupation at the end of World War I.U.S. Capture during World War IIDuring Lumberjack, on March 7, 1945, troops of the U.S. Armys 9th Armored Division reached one of the two damaged but usable bridges over the Rhine (a railway bridge in Wesel( in todays Rhine-Westphalia was the other one), after German defenders failed to demolish it, despite several attempts.Sergeant A. Drabik of Ohio, under heavy fire, was the first American soldier to cross the bridge, thereby becoming the first American soldier to cross the Rhine River into Germany; German-born Lieutenant Karl Timmermann was the first officer over the bridge.  Both were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for their actions.  Combat Command B of the 9th Armored was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for capturing the bridge. The first unit not of the 9th Armored Division to cross, and therefore neither infantry nor armor, was the 438th Artillery Battalion. The German commandant at Remagen, Lieutenant Willi Bratge, wanted to demolish the bridge as early as possible to avoid capture. He had only 36 soldiers at the bridge on the morning of  March 7, 1945. To add to confusion on the German side, Bratge was unaware until 1100hrs of the transfer of authority in the night to Major Hans Scheller, the adjutant of the area between Remagen and Schleiden. Scheller was ordered by his commanding general to assume the important task at the bridgehead. The Major wanted to keep the bridge open as long as possible, so that as many German soldiers as possible and their heavy equipment (tanks and some artillery pieces) were able to cross the bridge. The responsible bridge officer, Captain Friesenhahn, demanded a requisition of 600kg of demolition explosives, receiving at 1100 hrs only 300 kg of Donarit, a considerably weaker industrial explosive used in the mining industry. He tried to use them for a quick blast on the right bank side. At 1340 hrs the main American attack began. The first blast of the Germans, who set fire to a portion of the charges, tore a 10-meter-wide crater in the left bank ramp. At 1540 hrs, the bridge itself was blown up by order of Major Scheller, but remained standing. It lifted a bit and then dropped safely back in place, as an explosive cable had been destroyed. One of the last intact Rhine bridges had been taken by the Allies.Allied journalists termed the capture the Miracle of Remagen.  General of the Army D. Eisenhower declared the bridge worth its weight in gold and one of those bright opportunities of war which, when quickly and firmly grasped, produce incalculable effects on future operations.() It remained functional (but weakened severely), despite the German detonation of a small charge and a stronger charge a few minutes later.( The Allies used the bridge for truck and tank traffic. Eight thousand soldiers crossed it during the first 24 hours after capture.A large sign was placed on one of the stone towers marked CROSS THE RHINE WITH DRY FEET COURTESY OF 9TH ARMD DIVISION.  The sign is now  displayed at the Museum of Cavalry and Armor at Knox, Kentucky, above an Pershing tank, a type used in the battle. Of the ten Pershing tanks attached to the 9th Division, there is only one surviving example, which is on permanent view at the Wright Museum of WWII History in Wolfeboro, N.H. During the days after the bridges capture, the US 9th, 78th and the 99th Infantry divisions crossed the bridge.A flying court-martial chaired by Lieutenant General Rudolf Hbner found five officers guilty of cowardice and dereliction of duty under sentence of death four of whom, Major Scheller, Lieutenant Karl Heinz Peters, Major Herbert Strobel and Major August Kraft, were executed on the day of sentencing in the Westerwald (two in Rimbach, two in Oberirsen). Their family pension rights were revoked but reinstated after the war. The fifth officer, Hauptmann Bratge, was convicted and sentenced absentia, having become an American of war by this time.Hitlers main reaction was to dismiss Field Marshall von Rundstedt as commander-in-chief of the western front (West), replacing him with Field Marshall Kesselring.Bombardment and collapseAfter its capture, the Germans made repeated unsuccessful efforts to destroy it via aerial bombardment, field artillery and the use of floating mines.  On  March 9, 1945 a German counter-attack of the LXVII Armeekorps began, but was too weak to ensure success. The German High Command tried desperately to destroy the bridge in the following days, even using frogmen to plant mines and a railway gun which missed the target. In one of the few deployments of the type as tactical bombers, Ar 234 jets attempted to destroy the bridge()(observed by Stars and Stripes newspaper reporter Rooney),() and on March 17, 1945, eleven rockets were launched at the bridge from the Hellendoorn area of the Netherlands, about  north of Remagen, destroying a number of nearby buildings and killing at least six American soldiers.Later on March 17, ten days after its capture, the bridge suddenly collapsed into the Rhine. Twenty-eight U.S. Army engineers were killed while working to strengthen the bridge, and 93 others were injured.  However, by then the Americans had established a substantial bridgehead on the far side of the Rhine and had additional bridges in place.The collapse was not caused by a direct hit from a V-2, as the nearest strike was  away. However, the bridge had been weakened by the earlier bombing attacks. Some speculate that the wear and tear of weeks of bombardment, combined with the vibrations produced when a V-2 slammed into the earth at , was enough to cause the collapse of the bridge.The next day, Hitler sent a congratulatory telegram to the officer in charge of the V-2 rocket launching team at Hellendoorn. It is unknown whether Hitler was aware that there had not been a direct hit by a V-2 rocket, but the fact that the bridge collapsed on the same day as the attack, was probably enough for Hitler to associate the collapse directly with the V-2 bombardment.State todaythumb|Aerial photograph of bridge ruins made during 1953The surviving towers of the old bridge now house a museum dedicated to peace.(The Bridge at Remagen museum) The two piers were removed from the river in the summer of 1976, as they constituted an obstacle to navigation.In media and popular culture*A Hollywood film inspired by a book written about its capture, Bridge at Remagen, was made in 1969.*The Ludendorff Bridge features prominently in the final mission of the game of Duty: Finest Hour, in which the player must cross the bridge in order to capture it.*In the final mission of the American scenario in the tank simulation game Front, the player can only finish the campaign if his or her tank destroys enemy forces on the other side of the river before attempting to cross the bridge itself.*In Battlefield 2142: Northern Strike, the bridge was rebuilt as a suspension bridge and sections collapsed.

Squaw_Valley,_Placer_County,_California
Olympic Valley (commonly known as Squaw Valley) in the state of California is an unincorporated community located in Placer County northwest of Tahoe City along Highway 89 on the banks of the River near Tahoe. It is the home of the Valley Ski Resort, the site of the Winter Olympics. It is the smallest place in the world to ever host the Olympic Games.Mail to Squaw Valley is addressed, Olympic Valley, CA 96146() to avoid confusion with the census-designated place of the same name in County.HistorySquaw Valley was once a mining boom town and was the biggest mining operations in the Tahoe region. There were rumors that the mine was salted with ore brought in from City. Wharton James, Author of the book The Lake of the Sky doubts the mines were salted with ore and that the energetic prospector Knox started the mine with good faith. He writes all about the History of the Tahoe Region (pre1915) in many of the chapters of his book. The Squaw Valley Mining boom was short lived and by 186364 the valley soon lost almost all of its inhabitants to the lode in City, Nevada.By 1942 Wayne Poulsen, a former star skier from the University of Nevada, had acquired  in Squaw Valley from the Pacific Railroad. In 1946, Poulsen met Alex Cushing, a Harvard University-trained lawyer, with the political connections and access to capital that would make the resort a success. Shortly before opening in 1949, Poulsen and Cushing had a disagreement over the future of the resort, and eventually Cushing ended up controlling the Squaw Valley Ski Corporation.Though the 1960 Olympics had practically been promised to Innsbruck, Austria, Cushing went to Paris in 1955 with a scale model of his proposed Olympic site and persuaded the Olympic Committee to choose Squaw Valley. It was the first Winter Olympics to be televised live and attracted millions of viewers.Although the Squaw Valley Ski Resort remains the primary attraction in Olympic Valley, other year-round attractions and businesses have sprung up around the community.ReferencesExternal linksValleyValleyValley (Placer County)ValleyValley (condado de Placer, California)ValleyValley (Placer County)ko:ValleyValisValley (Placer County)ja:Valley (hrabstwo Placer)Valley, comitatul Placer, Californiaru:- ()Valley (okrug Placer)Valley

Lake_Anna
 cities  Lake Anna is one of the largest freshwater inland lakes in Virginia, covering an area of 13,000 acres (53 km), and located 72 miles (116 km) south of D.C. in Louisa and Spotsylvania counties (and partially in Orange County at the northern tips). The lake is easily accessible from Richmond and Charlottesville, and is one of the most popular recreational lakes in the state.  HistoryThe reservoir is formed by a dam on the Anna River. In 1968, Virginia Electric and Power Company (now Dominion) purchased 18,000 acres (73 km) of farmlands in three counties along the North Anna and Rivers to provide clean, fresh water to cool the nuclear power generating plants at the Anna Nuclear Generating Station adjacent to the lake.(North Anna Power Station, Dominion. Accessed on June 30, 2009.) By 1972 the lake bottom was cleared of all timber and the dam was nearing completion. It was projected to take three years to completely fill the lake, but with the additional rainfall from Agnes, the lake was full in only 18 months. The first communities broke ground at about that same time and now some 120 different communities dot the shores of the lake. In 2010, a boating accident occurred on the lake, killing a Spotsylvania County Sheriffs deputy.(Sheriffs deputy killed in boating accident, WTOP-FM, Washington, DC, 19 June 2010. Retrieved on June 26, 2010.)DescriptionLake Anna is approximately  long from tip to tip, with some 200 miles (300 km) of shoreline.(Waste Heat Treatment Facility, Dominion. Accessed on June 30, 2009.) The lake is divided into two sides: the public side (also known as the cold side) and the private side (also known as the hot side). The public side is roughly 9,000 acres (36 km), while the private side is roughly 4,000 acres (16 km). The private side is formed of three main bodies of water, connected by navigable canals. The public and private sides are divided by three stone dikes. The private side has no marinas or public access ramps; only property owners and North Anna Power Station employees have access to the waters of the private side. The public side has several marinas and boat launches, including a boat ramp at the state park. The public side sees significantly higher boat traffic than the private side, especially on summer weekends.The public side is known as the cold side because it provides water to cool the generators at the power plant; the private or hot side receives warm water discharge from the power plant. The private side can be substantially warmer than the public side, especially near the discharge point, where it can be too hot for swimming. The private side has an extended sports season. Some water circulates back out of the private side into the public side through underground channels; consequently, the public side is warmer in the southern area near the dam. In the winter, some fish migrate to these warmer waters. Preliminary steps toward the addition of a third reactor have raised protests from environmentalists and property owners, who fear an increase in the water temperature and a decrease in the water level, particularly on the private side. According to Dominion, the water discharged from the plant is usually about 14 degrees F warmer than the intake water.(Use and recreationGaining in popularity as a vacation destination, a retirement destination, and a second home location for many, the manmade lake offers swimming, sailing, boating, world-class fishing, and multiple annual triathlons. Surrounding attractions include vineyards, antique shopping, golf, historic sites, theme parks, and hiking. To get the most out of the lake, one can rent a boat from various local marinas and businesses. Sailboat enthusiasts will prefer the more open, wide water appeal of the southern end of the lake, although the lakes several bridges, including the main 208 bridge, are too low for a sailboat to pass beneath. Water sports junkies tend to enjoy the mid-lake area, while the fishing crowd has lots of hot spots in nooks and crannies of the northern on Golden pond end. Anglers fish for over 30 species including bass, bass, walleye, catfish, crappie, bluegill, perch and perch. Weekly fishing leagues keep local residents happy, while sanctioned tournaments bring fishermen and women from afar.Anna State Park, complete with picnic areas and boat launching ramps, is located directly on the lake on the public side, making it available to everyone. The park also has a beach area with snack bar, docks, an exhibit center showing how the lake was created, and miles of hiking and horse trails. One can tour the remains of gold mine and pan for gold. The original plantation house still stands in ruins and a hiking trail leads to it. The state park offers rental cabins for overnight lodging.(Lake Anna State Park, United States Park Service. Accessed on June 30, 2009.) Visitors also can stay at waterfront hotels, or in any of dozens of available vacation rental waterfront homes.Triathlon festivalsLake Anna is the site of in Bumpass, an annual spring triathlon festival, with an International/Olympic-distance race and a sprint-distance race held on consecutive days.(Rumpus in Bumpass, official site.

Cedros_Island
thumb|300px|right|Location of Cedros Island in the state of Baja CaliforniaCedros Island (Isla de Cedros, island of cedars in Spanish, also called in English Cerros Island in former times) is a Mexican island in the Ocean.It is located off the west coast of the state of California from which it is separated by 100 km (62 mi)-wide Vizcano Bay, 22 km (13.5 mi) northwest of Eugenia in municipality - the westernmost point of the California Sur mainland. It also lies 15 km (9.25 mi) north of Natividad (off Punta Eugenia, and also part of Muleg) from which it is separated by the de Keller, and some 500 km (310 mi) from of Diego(DigitalGlobe et al. (2007)). The island has an area of 348.295 km (134.477 mi), being the fourth-largest island in Mexico (following Island, ngel de la Guarda, and Cozumel). It is part of the Municipality of Ensenada.Between Cedros Island and Isla Natividad runs the 28th parallel north, which defines the border between the Mexican states of California and California Sur. The San Benito, about 25 km (16 mi) west and 3.899 km (1.505 mi) in area, are administratively part of Cedros Island.The Isla de Cedros was named by early Spanish explorers who mistakenly associated the large amounts of redwood and cedar driftwood arriving with the California current for local pines visible on the crest of the island. Population and settlements Image:Cedros.jpg|thumb|300px|right|annotated Shuttle photo of Cedros IslandIt constitutes one of the 24 subdivisions (delegaciones) of the municipio of Ensenada.  The 2005 census(INEGI (2007)) showed a total population of 1,350 persons.The borough seat is Cedros town (Pueblo Cedros), on the southern east coast. Pueblo Cedros is largely associated with Pescadores Nacionales de Abuln, the lobster and abalone fishing cooperative based on the island. It was founded by fishermen in 1922.The second town is Puerto Morro Redondo (in short, El Morro), close to the southeastern point of the island, El Morro. It is a company town, built by the joint Government and Corporation to house the workers of the salt-transshipment facility on the island. Salt from the evaporation ponds of Negro on the California peninsula is taken by barge to a deepwater salt dock near Puerto Morro Redondo, at the south end of Cedros Island, where it is loaded onto ships for export. There is regularly scheduled air service to the island from Ensenada, departing every Monday and Wednesday, and landing at an airstrip at the south end, adjacent to the company town, while a 10 km (6 mi) road leads to Pueblo Cedros. Open launch rides across the channel between Cedros and the mainland can also be arranged at the Ramales store in Tortugas, but travellers opting for this transport should be prepared to have a flexible schedule with several extra days in case of inclement weather conditions in the Channel.The remaining settlements are smaller. Jerusalem is just west of El Morro, but on the western side of the airport, with regularly arranged residential units. It is frequently considered part of El Morro.Lomas Blancas, a mining town with 17 buildings, is located between Cedros town and El Morro.San Agustn, a typical fishing village with about 20 buildings, is located 1 km northeast of the southwestern point of the island, Cabo San Agustn.La Colorada, on the southern west coast, with about 10 buildings, is 4 km north of San Agustn.Wayle, 15 buildings on the western side of the southern bight Baha del Sur, is 3 km northeast of San Agustn.The mining town of Punta Norte (about 25 buildings) is located on the northern east coast, 3.5 km southeast of the northern end of the island, which is also called Punta Norte. Two km to the southeast is Los Crestones mine.List of settlements and locations:#Cedros, #Puerto Morro Redondo, #Jerusalem, #Lomas Blancas, #San Agustn, #La Colorada, #Wayle, #Punta Norte, HistoryIsla Cedros was home to some of the earliest occupants of the Pacific Coast of North America, and its later indigenous inhabitants had developed a way of life finely attuned to the conditions of this arid but resource-rich island. They had probably reached an overall population around 1,000-1,200 inhabitants by the time of European contact. Currently, archaeological research into the indigenous history of the island is being conducted by researchers from State University, Northridge and State University, under the direction of Dr. Matthew R. Des Lauriers. More than 70 sites have been identified, with several dating in excess of 10,000 years old.In 1539, when the Spanish expedition led by de Ulloa landed on the island, it encountered several villages with populations at each estimated in the hundreds.  These native peoples possessed sophisticated maritime technology and watercraft and depended largely on ocean resources for their livelihood.  These peoples were Cochim speakers, related to the Native American tribes of California, the lower River, and Western Arizona.Finding it difficult to reach the remaining Indians on the island, Jesuit fathers brought them all to San Ignacio on the Baja California mainland in 1732.  Hunters seeking seals and otters worked out the island between 1790 and 1850.  Gold and copper mining took place near Punta Norte between 1890 and 1917.  The fishing village and cannery at Puerto Cedros were established in 1920.  The fishing cooperative was founded in 1943, and the deepwater salt dock at the south end of the island was built in 1966. The island was mapped in detail by Mexican and U.S. geologists during the 1970s. For some time, the western side had some cattle ranching. Natural history Cedros Island is at most some 38 km (24 mi) long in N-S direction and  6.48 km (4-5 mi) wide in the northern half; the southern end is some 17 km (11 mi) wide in a NW-SE direction(DigitalGlobe et al. (2007). The measurements in Thayer & Bangs (1907) are in nautical miles.). The island consists of a variety of sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks, including part of an ophiolite complex and high-pressure, low temperature blueschists. Most of the rocks are of Mesozoic age, though some late Cenozoic strata crop out near the town in the southeastern corner of the island. Its highest peak, Monte Cedros, has an elevation of 1,205 meters (3,949 feet). The island is often shrouded in fog, so that some plants have adapted to receiving moisture from fog. The west side of the island is windswept and subject to heavy surf; Pacific hurricanes hit is not unusual. The lower elevations, in particlular the south, receive very little rainfall, and desert vegetation prevails. At higher elevations and in the north, there are trees like cedrosensis oaks, Juniper(The cedar of Thayer & Bangs (1907)), and Pines.Vargas or El Aguaje de Vargas is the most important spring with a flow of 180 drums of 200 lts or  55 gal  each 12  hours, Springs on the island are usually marked by groves of trees.Large lion colonies are found on the rocks on the west side as well as the anchorage on the north end.There are feral goats on Cedros. Unlike on other islands in the region (notably Island), they do not seem to have had a significant impact in the island ecosystem. This would be due to the fact that Cedros is on the shelf close to the coast, and at least temporarily, it must have been connected to the mainland during the ice age when levels were lower than today. Then, and as a consequence of this, there are native to Cedros herbivores, which on one hand compete with the goat population for food and presumably have kept it from increasing beyond capacity, and on the other hand forced the native plants to keep their defences against herbivores, unlike plants on megaherbivoreless islands which tend to lack those defences. Endemism Cedros Island is home to a number of taxa that are endemic to or occur in very few places outside the island. These include:Animals:(Thayer & Bangs (1907))* Cedros Side-blotched Lizard, stansburiana concinna - endemic* Cedros Island Wren, Thryomanes bewickii cerroensis - near-endemic(Nowadays includes T. b. atricauda from the adjacent mainland.)* Cedros Island Deer, Odocoileus hemionus cerrosensis - endemic* Cedros Island Rabbit, Sylvilagus bachmani cerrosensis - endemic* Cedros Island Mouse, Peromyscus eremicus cedrosensis - endemicPlants:(CMICD (2007))* Cryptantha maritima var. cedrosensis - endemic* cedrosensis - endemic* pachyphytum - endemic* molle - endemic* Harfordia macroptera ssp. fruticosa - endemic* veatchii - endemic* cedrosensis - endemic* Mammillaria goodridgei var. goodridgei - endemic* Mammillaria goodridgei var. rectispina - endemic* stellatus - endemic* thymifolia - endemic* cedrosensis - endemic* Pinus radiata var. binata (Guadalupe Island Monterey Pine) - near-endemic; possibly separable as var./ssp. cedrosensis and in this case endemic* cedrense - endemic* Quercus cedrosensis (Island Oak) - near-endemic* Rhus integrifolia var. cedrosensis - endemic* cedrosensis - endemic* hastata - endemic* Xylonagra arborea ssp. arborea - endemicSee also*of the west coast of North America*de Cedros Airport Footnotes ( References *  (2007): Plant accounts: Guadalupe Island.

Imperial_Russian_Navy
Russian Navy Jack|right|thumb|180pxRussian Navy Ensign|right|thumb|180pxThe Imperial Russian Navy refers to the Tsarist fleets prior to the Revolution.First RomanovsUnder Tsar Mikhail Feodorovich, construction of the first three-masted ship, actually built within Russia, was completed in 1636. It was built in Balakhna by Danish shipbuilders from Holstein according to European design and was christened the Frederick. During its maiden voyage on the Sea, the Frederick unfortunately sailed into a heavy storm and was lost at sea.During the War, 1656-1658, Russian forces seized the Swedish fortresses of Dunaburg and Kokenhausen on the Western Dvina and the latter was renamed Tsarevich-Dmitriev. A boyar named Ordin-Nashchokin founded a shipyard at Tsarevich-Dmitriev fortress and began constructing vessels to sail in the Baltic Sea. In 1661, however, Russia was once again forced to abide by the harsh terms of a treaty, this time the Peace of Cardis. Russia agreed to surrender to Sweden all captured territories, and all vessels constructed at Tsarevich-Dmitriev were ordered destroyed.Boyar Ordin-Nashchyokin, not grieving long over defeat, turned his attention to the River and Caspian Sea. With the Tsars approval, the boyar brought Dutch shipbuilding experts to the town of Dedinovo near the confluence of the Oka and Volga Rivers. Shipbuilding commenced in the winter of 1667. Within two years, four vessels had been completed: one 22-gun galley, christened the  (OryolEagle), and three smaller ships. The ill-fated Frederick had been a Holstein vessel; the  became Russias first own three-masted, European-designed sailing ship but met with a similarly unfortunate end. The ship was captured in Astrakhan by rebellious Cossacks led by Razin. The Cossacks ransacked the  and abandoned it, half-submerged, in an estuary of the Volga.During much of the 17th century, Russian merchants and Cossacks, using koch boats, sailed across the Sea, exploring the Rivers Lena, Kolyma and Indigirka, and founding settlements in the region of the upper Amur. Unquestionably, the most celebrated Russian explorer was Dezhnev, who, in 1648, sailed the entire length of present-day Russia by way of the Ocean. Rounding the Peninsula, Dezhnev passed through the Sea and sailed into the Pacific Ocean.Russian Navy during the reign of Peter the GreatImage:Goto Predestinacia 1.jpg|right|thumb|Predestinatsia, flagship of Azov flotilla until 1711The creation of the regular Russian Navy took place during the reign of Peter the Great. During the Second Azov campaign of 1696 against Turkey, the Russians employed for the first time 2 warships, 4 fireships, 23 galleys and 1300 strugs, built on the River. After the occupation of the Azov fortress, the Duma looked into Peters report of this military campaign and passed a decree on commencing the construction of the navy on October 20, 1696. This date is considered the official birthday of the regular Russian Navy.During the Northern War of 1700-1721, the Russians built the Fleet. The construction of the oared fleet (galley fleet) took place in 1702-1704 at several shipyards (estuaries of the rivers Syas, Luga and Olonka). In order to be able to defend the conquered coastline and attack enemys maritime communications in the Sea, the Russians created a sailing fleet from the ships built in Russia and imported from abroad. From 1703-1723, the main base of the Baltic Fleet was located in Petersburg and then in Kronstadt. The bases were also created in Reval (Tallinn) and in Vyborg after it was ceded from Sweden after the war of 1741-43. At first, Prikaz was in charge of shipbuilding. Later on, these functions were transferred to the Prikaz.In 1745, the Russian Navy had 130 sailing vessels, including 36 ships of the line, 9 frigates, 3 shnyavas (  a light two-mast ship used for reconnaissance and messenger services), 5 bombardier ships and 77 auxiliary vessels. The oared fleet consisted of 396 vessels, including 253 galleys and semi-galleys (called , or scampavei; a light high-speed galley) and 143 brigantines. The ships were being constructed at 24 shipyards, including the ones in Voronezh, Kazan, , Arkhangelsk, Olonets, Petersburg and Astrakhan.The naval officers for the fleet were supplied from among the dvoryane (noblemen) and regular sailors  from recruits. The service in the navy was lifelong. Children of noblemen were educated for naval service at the School for Mathematical and Navigational Sciences, which had been founded in 1701 in Moscows Sukharev Tower. Students were often sent abroad for training in foreign fleets. It was also customary to hire foreign nationals, who had significant naval experience, to serve in the Russian Navy, such as the Norwegian-Dutch Cruys, the Greek Botsis or the Scotsman Thomas Gordon. In 1718, the Admiralty Board (-) was established as the highest naval authority in Russia.Image:Cathedral kronstadt.jpg|thumb|The naval cathedral in Kronstadt was one of several cathedrals of the Imperial Russian Navy.The organizational principles of the Russian Navy, educational and training methods for preparing future staff, and methods for conducting military action were all summarized in the Naval Charter (1720) penned by Peter I himself.(  (Naval Regulations),  , 1763) Peter the Great, Feodor Apraksin, Senyavin, Senyavin, Golitsyn and others are generally credited for the development of the Russian art of warfare. The main principles of naval warfare were further developed by Spiridov, Ushakov, and Senyavin.Russian Navy in the 18th centuryIn the 2nd half of the 18th century, the Russian Navy grew stronger due to activization of Russias foreign policy and Russo-Turkish wars for supremacy in the Sea. For the first time, Russia sent its squadrons from the Baltic Sea to distant theaters of operations (see Archipelago expeditions of the Russian Navy). Admiral Spiridovs squadron gained supremacy in the Sea by destroying the Turkish fleet in the of Chesma in 1770. In 1771, the Russian army conquered the coasts of the Strait and fortresses of Kerch and Yenikale.After having advanced to the Danube, the Russians formed the Military Flotilla for the purpose of guarding the Danube estuary. In 1773, the vessels of the Flotilla (created anew in 1771) sailed out into the Black Sea. The Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774 ended victoriously for Russia, which gained the coasts of the of Azov and a part of the Black Sea coastline between the rivers Bug and Dniester. The Crimea was pronounced independent under Russias protectorate and would become a part of Russia in 1783. In 1778, the Russians founded the port of Kherson. It is in this city that the first battleship of the Sea Fleet was commissioned in 1783. A year later, it was already a squadron.Early 19th centuryIn the 2nd half of the 18th century-early 19th century, the Russian Navy had the third largest fleet in the world after Great Britain and France. The Black Sea Fleet possessed five line-of-battle ships and 19 frigates (1787), the Baltic Fleet had 23 ships of the line and 130 frigates (1788). In the early 19th century, the Russian Navy consisted of the Baltic and Black Sea Fleets, Flotilla, Sea Flotilla and Flotilla. In 1802, the Ministry of Naval Military Forces was established (renamed to Naval Ministry in 1815).In 1826, the Russians built their first armed steamboat Izhora (), equipped with eight cannons. In 1836, they constructed the first paddle steam frigate of the Russian Navy called Bogatyr (displacement  , power  , armament  28 cannons). Between 1803 and 1855, Russian sailors undertook over 40 circumnavigations and long-distant voyages, most of which were in support of their Pacific colonies in Alaska, California, and the ports on the eastern seaboard of Siberia.These voyages played an important role in the exploration of the Far East, different oceans and contributed important scientific research materials and discoveries in Pacific, Antarctic and Arctic theatres of operations.of the Admiralty Board, 1810s.Crimean War and aftermathRussias slow technical and economical development in the 1st half of the 19th century caused her to fall behind other European countries in the field of steamboat construction. By the outbreak of the War in 1853, Russia had the Baltic and Black Sea Fleets, Arkhangelsk Flotilla, Caspian Flotilla and Okhotsk Flotilla (altogether, 40 battleships, 15 frigates, 24 corvettes and brigs, 16 steam frigates etc.).The combined number of staff of all the fleets equaled 91,000 people. Despite all this, the reactionary serfdom system had an adverse effect on the development of the Russian Navy. It was especially typical of the Baltic Fleet, which was known for its harsh military drill.Thanks to admirals Mikhail Lazarev, Nakhimov, Kornilov, and Istomin, the sailors of the Black Sea Fleet were taught the art of warfare and upholding of military traditions of the Russian Navy, formed in the times of Admiral Ushakov.The of Sinop in 1853 the Black Sea Fleet under Nakhimov made a number of tactical innovations. During the Siege of Sevastopol in 1854-1855, the Russian sailors used all means possible to defend their base from land and sea. In accordance with the Treaty of Paris, Russia lost the right to have a military fleet in the Black Sea. In the 1860s, the Russian fleet which had relied upon sails lost its significance and was gradually replaced by steam.After the Crimean War, Russia commenced construction of steam-powered ironclads, monitors, and floating batteries. These vessels had strong artillery and thick armor, but lacked seaworthiness, speed and long-distance abilities. In 1861, they built the first steel-armored gunship Opyt (). In 1869, the Russians began the construction of one of the first seafaring ironclads Pyotr Velikiy ( ).Later 19th centuryFile:3090 paddlesteamer lg.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fuxiangs Braves laid mines which blew up a Russian paddle Steamer at Shanhaiguan, inflicting many casualties upon the Russians during the Rebellion. Popular sentiment in China was stirred up against the Russians.In 1863, during the Civil War, the Russian Navys Atlantic and Pacific Fleets wintered in the American ports of New York and San Francisco respectively. Some historians credit this visit as a major factor in deterring France and England from entering the war on the Confederate side.(Norman E. Saul, Richard D. McKinzie. Russian-American Dialogue on Cultural Relations, 1776-1914 p 95. ISBN 082621097X, 9780826210975) Delahaye states that besides supporting the Union, Russia was also preparing for a war with France and England should they intervene in the Polish insurrection of 1863. The Russian Navy was weak and could easily be blockaded in its home ports, but if it was in the US when the war started it could more easily attack British and French commerce.(Tom Delahaye. The Bilateral Effect of the Visit of the Russian Fleet in 1863 http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1983-4/delehaye.htm Retrieved Sept 4 2008.)The Imperial Russian Navy continued to expand in the later part of the century becoming the third largest fleet in the world after Britain and France. The expansion accelerated under Tsar II who had been influenced by the American naval theoretician Thayer Mahan. Russian industry, although growing in capacity, was not able to meet the demands and some ships were ordered from Britain, France, Germany, USA, and Denmark. French naval architects in particular had a considerable influence on Russian designs.Russo-Japanese WarOn the night of February 8, 1904, the Japanese naval fleet under Admiral Togo opened the war with a surprise attack by boat destroyers(Grant p. 12, 13, 15, etc. continuous through-out the book) on the Russian ships at Port Arthur, badly damaging two Russian battleships. The attacks developed into the of Port Arthur the next morning. A series of indecisive naval engagements followed, in which the Japanese were unable to attack the Russian fleet successfully under batteries (coastal guns)(Grant p. 46, 51, 54, 63, etc. through-out the book) of the harbor and the Russians declined to leave the harbor for the open seas, especially after the death of Admiral Osipovich Makarov on 13 April 1904.After the attack on Port Arthur, the Japanese attempted to deny the Russians use of the port. On the night of 13/14 February, the Japanese attempted to block the entrance to Port Arthur by sinking several cement-filled steamers in the deep water channel to the port.(Grant p. 48-57) But the steamers, driven off course by Russian gunfire were unable to sink them in the designated places, rendering them ineffective. Another attempt to block the harbor entrance on the night of 3/4 May with blockships also failed.Mine-layingIn March, the energetic(Grant p. 93) Vice Admiral Makarov (18491904) took command of the First Russian Pacific Squadron with the intention of making plans to break out of the Port Arthur blockade. By then, both sides began a policy of tactical offensive mine-laying by laying mines in each others ports. This was the first time in warfare that mines were used for offensive purposes. In the past, mines were used as purely defensive purposes by keeping harbors safe from invading warships.The Japanese mine-laying policy was effective at restricting the Russian movement of its ships outside Port Arthur when on 12 April 1904, two Russian battleships; the flagship  and the  ran into a Japanese minefield off Port Arthur with both striking mines.(Grant p. 127, 128) Petropavlosk sank within an hour, while Pobeda had to be towed back to Port Arthur for extensive repairs. Makarov died on Petropavlovsk.However, the Russians soon learned the Japanese tactic of offensive minelaying and decided to play the strategy too. On 15 May, two Japanese battleships   and , were both lured into a recently laid Russian minefield off Port Arthur, both striking at least two mines. Yashima sank within minutes taking 450 sailors with her, while Hatsuse sank under tow a few hours later.(Grant p. 163; Diarist may have only been aware of battleship Hatsuses sinking, as he does not mention the Yashima.  However, the commanders diary had been translated into two different languages between 1905 and 1907 (Spanish and English), so it is highly possible that that information may have been lost during translation)The Russian fleet attempted to break out from Port Arthur and proceed to Vladivostok, but they were intercepted and dispersed at the of the Yellow Sea.(Grant p. 171-177) The remnant of the Russian fleet remained in Port Arthur, where they were slowly sunk by the artillery of the besieging army. Attempts to relieve the city from the land also failed, and after the of Liaoyang in late August, the Russians retreated to Mukden (Shenyang). Port Arthur finally fell on 2 January 1905, after a series of brutal, high-casualty assaults.Russian submarinesBy 25 June, the Imperial Russian Navy had purchased (in secrecy) its first naval submarine (known as Madam) from Rices Boat Company. This submarine was (originally) built under the direction of Leopold Busch as the American Torpedo Boat Fulton. It was a proto-type of the (Holland Type 7 Design) known as the Adder Class/class submarines. By 10 October, this first IRN submarine was (officially) commissioned into service (and shipped to) the eastern coast near Vladivostok Russia and was renamed Som or (Catfish). This first Russian submarine was not ready in time for the Russo-Japanese War. The reason behind this delay was partly due to a (late) shipment of torpedoes (that was) originally ordered from Germany in early 1905. Russia soon ordered more submarines (of the same basic design) and they were built under contract with the Holland Company by the Shipbuilding Company located in Petersburg, Russia.In 1903, the German ship building firm Germaniawerft at Kiel completed Germanys first fully functioning engine powered submarine; the Forelle. The submarine was toured (inspected) by Wilhelm II, and Heinrich of Prussia was given a brief cruise in the vessel.(Showell, p. 22, 25, 201)  In April 1904, the Imperial Russian Navy purchased the Forelle, and ordered two more submarines of the Karp class.(Showell, p. 25)  These vessels, as well as the Forelle were transported along the Railway(Grant p. 140) enroute to the war zone.Germaniawerft, under the supervision of Spanish naval architect Raymondo Lorenzo dEuevilley-Montjustin, continued his work on the Karp class submarines, improving and modifying one into Germanys first U-boat, U-1, which was commissioned into the German Navy on 14 December 1906.(Showell, p. 24 & 30)  U1 was retired in 1919, and is currently on display at the Museum in Munich.(Showell, p. 36 & 37)Due to the ongoing blockade of Port Arthur in 1904, the IRN dispatched their remaining submarines to Vladivostok, and by the end of 1904 the last of seven subs had reached their new base there.  Using the seven boats as a foundation, the IRN created the worlds first operational submarine fleet at Vladivostak on 1 January 1905.  On 14 February 1905 the new submarine fleet sent out its first combat patrol consisting of the IRN Som and Delfin.  With patrols varying from 24 hours to a few days, the sub fleets first enemy contact occurred on 29 April 1905 when IJN torpedo boats fired upon the Som, scoring no hits the IJN TBs withdrew.  On 1 July the IRN submarine Keta made contact with two IJN torpedo boats in the Strait.  The Keta could not submerge quick enough to obtain a firing position and both adversaries broke contact.(Olender p. 175)Decisive battle: TsushimaThe Russians had already been preparing to reinforce their fleet the previous year by sending elements of the Sea fleet (The Second Pacific Squadron) under Admiral Rozhestvensky around the of Good Hope to Asia, a voyage of over . On 21 October 1904, while passing by the United Kingdom (an ally of Japan but neutral in this war), they nearly provoked a war in the Bank incident by firing on British fishing boats that they mistook for Japanese boats.The duration of the Baltic Fleets journey meant that Togo was well aware of the Fleets progress, and he made plans to meet it before it could reach port at Vladivostok. He intercepted them in the Strait between Korea and Japan, in the early morning of 27 May 1905. Although both battleship fleets were on nearly equal footing in regards to the latest in battleship technology, with the British warship designs representing the Japanese Navy, and predominately the French designs being favored by the Russian fleets;(Forczyk p. 11-13) it was the combat experience that Togo had accrued in the 1904 naval battles of Port Arthur and the Sea, that gave him the edge over the un-tested Admiral Rozhestvensky during the of Tsushima on 27 May.(Forczyk p. 41-54) By the end of the day on 27 May, nearly all of Rozhestvenskys battleships were sunk, including his flagship, the Prince Suvorov; and on the following day, Admiral Nebogatov, who had relieved Rozhestvensky due to his wounds, surrendered the remainder of the fleet to Admiral Togo.Reconstruction prior to World War IAt the end of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Russia fell from being the third greatest naval power to sixth place. The focus of Russian naval activities shifted back from the Far East to the Baltic. Fleets task was to defend Baltic Sea and Saint Petersburg from the Germans.Tsar Nicholas II created a Naval General Staff in 1906. At first, attention was directed to creation of mine-laying and a submarine fleet. An ambitious expansion program was put before the Duma in 1907-1908 but was voted down. The Crisis of 1909 forced a strategic reconsideration, and new class battleships, cruisers, and destroyers were ordered for the Baltic Fleet. A worsening of relations with Turkey meant that new ships including the Mariya class battleships were also ordered for the Black Sea Fleet. The total Russian naval expenditure from 1906-1913 was $519 million, in fifth place behind Britain, Germany, USA and France.The re-armament program included a significant element of foreign participation with several ships (including the cruiser Rurik) and machinery ordered from foreign firms. After the outbreak of World War I, ships and equipment being built in Germany were confiscated. Equipment from Britain was slow in reaching Russia or was diverted to the Western Allies own war effort.World War IBaltic SeaImage:The Poltava.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Baltic Fleets dreadnought Poltava in 1916.In the Sea, Germany and Russia were the main combatants, with a number of British submarines sailing through the Kattegat to assist the Russians, including E9 commanded by Horton. With the German fleet larger and more modern (many Seas Fleet ships could easily be deployed to the Baltic via the Canal when the North Sea was quiet), the Russians played a mainly defensive role, at most attacking convoys between Germany and Sweden and laying offensive minefields. Russian and British submarines attacked German shipping sailing between Sweden and Germany.With heavy defensive and offensive mining on both sides, fleets played a limited role on the Eastern Front. The Germans mounted major naval attacks on the of Riga, unsuccessfully in August 1915 and successfully in October 1917, when they occupied the islands in the Gulf (Albion) and damaged Russian ships departing from Riga (of Moon Sound), which had recently been captured by Germany.By March 1918, the Russian Revolution and the of Brest-Litovsk made the Baltic a German lake, and German fleets transferred troops to support newly independent Finland and to occupy much of Russia, halting only when defeated in the West. The Russians evacuated the Baltic fleet from Helsinki and Tallinn to Kronstadt during the Cruise of the Baltic Fleet in March 1918.Black Sealeft|thumb|300px|Black Sea Fleets battleship brigade in line ahead led by the Ioann ZlatoustThe Sea was the domain of the Russians and the Ottoman Empire but the Russian fleet dominated the sea. It possessed a large fleet based in Sevastopol and it was led by two skilled commanders: Admiral Eberhart and Admiral Kolchak (who took over in 1916).The war in the Black Sea started when the Ottoman fleet bombarded several Russian cities in October 1914. The most advanced ships in the Ottoman fleet consisted of just two German ships: the battlecruiser  and light cruiser , both under the command of Admiral Souchon. The Goeben was damaged on at least four different occasions and was usually chased back to port by the superior Russian navy. By the end of 1915, the Russian fleet had nearly complete control of the sea.The Black Sea fleet was used mainly to support General Yudenich in his Campaign. For example, in August 1915, a Russian submarine and two Russian destroyers attacked a Turkish convoy of four transports escorted by a cruiser and two destroyers. The Russian ships sank all four transports without losing a ship. Later, during the summer of 1916, the Ottoman army, under, Pasha, was ordered to re-take Trebizond. The Ottoman forces tried to march along the coast in June but the Russian fleet was able to reduce the speed of their advance to a crawl using naval bombardment to harass marching troops and destroy their supply columns. Eventually the Ottoman army gave up and withdrew.After Admiral Kolchak took command (August 1916), the Russian fleet mined the exit from the Bosporus, preventing nearly all Ottoman ships from entering the Black Sea. Later that year, the naval approaches to Varna were also mined. The greatest loss suffered by the Russian Black Sea fleet was the destruction of the modern dreadnought Imperatritsa Mariya, which blew up in port on 7 October 1916, just one year after it was commissioned. The sinking the Empress Maria was never fully explained, it could have been sabotage or a terrible accident.(The History of the Russian Navy - Chapter 11. The Great War - In the Black Sea)Revolution and Civil WarThe Revolution and subsequent civil war devastated the Russian Navy. Only the Baltic fleet based at Petrograd largely remained intact although it was attacked by the British Royal Navy in 1919. Foreign Interventionists occupied the Pacific, Black Sea and Arctic coasts. Most of the surviving Black Sea Fleet warships were under the control of Nikolayevich Wrangel and were interned in Bizerta, Tunisia at the end of the conflict (see fleet). Russian sailors fought on both sides in this bloody conflict. The sailors of the Baltic fleet rebelled against harsh treatment by the Soviet authorities in the rebellion of 1921.The surviving ships formed the core of the Navy.See also*of ships of the line of Russia*of Russian battleships*of Russian sail frigates*of Russian steam frigates*of cruisers of the Russian Navy*of Imperial Russian navy destroyers*Heads of Imperial Russian Navy*of Russian admiralsNotesReferences*Russian Submarine forces history*History of the Russian Navy*http://www.webcitation.org/query?urlhttp://www.geocities.com/gwmccue&date2009-10-25+23:37:32 Web site focusing on submarine history and the works of Irish-American inventor, John Philip Holland and his company which was known as The Holland Torpedo Boat Company.

Atikokan
footnotes              Atikokan (Ojibwe for caribou bones) is a township in the District of Rainy River in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. In 2006, the population was 3,293. The town is one of the main entry points into Provincial Park and promotes itself as the Canoeing Capital of Canada. Atikokan was originally established as a rail stop for the Northern Railway.The township of Atikokan is an enclave within the Unorganized Rainy River District.HistoryEarly historyThe original settlers to the Atikokan area were the Oschekamega Wenenewak (The people of the cross ridges). They lived by themselves until the arrival of de Noyon in 1688. His journey was critical for the expansion and exploration of the Atikokan area.Within the short span of just 200 years, the population of the Natives was almost cut in half. With the diseases brought from the Europeans, and their rivals, the Sioux, being the main causes. Another major blow to the natives was the lackadaisical care of fire brought by the new explorers, which resulted in the destruction of moss, the caribous main food source. The lower caribou populations resulted in a struggle to find food sources for the native people.19th century to mid-20th centuryThe road to AtikokanPalliser Gladman-Hind suggested the first real road in the area, he intended for it to go as far as possible starting from Arrow Lake, and after the roads end travellers would take a waterway to Fort Frances. Simon Dawson, on the other hand, thought the road could go from Dog Lake, to Thunder Bay, then using a series of dams, would allow even the larger boats to travel along the route of Dog River, Savanne River, Lac des Mille Lacs, via Pickerel Lake and Sturgeon Lake.The government, ignoring both plans, decided to build a road west of Lac des Mille Lacs, down the Seine River and finally into Lake. In 1859, James Dawson was hired to begin the route, but the plan was held up due to poor economic conditions in the east. In 1867, after Confederation, there became an increased need for communication to the west. Construction of the Trail began in Prince Arthurs Landing in 1868. Construction was sped up in 1869 as the Riel Rebellion resulted in the need to transport troops.The first residentsTom Rawn and his wife were the first residents of Atikokan, arriving by canoe in 1899. Tom was lured to Atikokan by both the allure of gold in the area and because of plans by the Canadian Northern Railway to build a point. Tom moved here because he had heard that there was need of shelter for the workers on the railway. Within a year of moving to Atikokan, Tom Rawn built the Pioneer Hotel, which had 18 rooms on its second story. In 1900, he was the first to strike a claim for iron ore in the Steep Rock area.The beginning of the townIn 1937, when Julian Cross discovered ore, it seemed like Atikokan had some potential for becoming a real town. The first real showing was the construction of the Imperial Bank of Commerce on Clark Street. Pitt Construction arrived later to construct roads. Their new way of making roads with machines amazed old-timers, who were used to making them using a pick, shovel and wheelbarrow. In 1950, the population had grown to 3,000 people.The first businesses in Atikokan could buy lots on Main Street for only $10 an acre, but the prices soon skyrocketed to $100 per square foot! Even with the high costs, stores, restaurants, banks and other establishments sprang up very quickly. The second bank to open was the Toronto-Dominion, the third, the Bank of Canada.Economic historyThe fur tradeThe boom of the trade started after the explorations of de Noyon in 1688, de la Noue in 1717 and La Verendrye in 1731. The first English post was built on the shores of of the Woods and Lake. The first French post however was on Portage, Minnesota. By 1741, the French fur trading posts had extended as far west as Saskatchewan, and were actually competing with the much larger Bay Company.Just as the French were poised to become the larger company, Great Britain conquered Canada, and the French trade disappeared with it. This caused an explosion in the number of independent traders, resulting in the trade becoming extremely violent. Some traders even succumbed to murder as a way for them to be the most profitable fur trader. In 1779, the independent traders put aside their differences to form a union of traders which would be called the West Company in order to compete with the much larger Hudsons Bay Company. The North West Company made Grand Portage their headquarters, and using a route that skimmed the border, were able to compete with the Hudsons Bay Company for the fur.Iron miningThe potential for the Steep Rock iron mine was revealed in 1897 by a non-resident geologist named William McInnis. Nothing was done until the winter of 19291930, when Julian Cross started interviewing iron and steel companies to try to unlock Steep Rocks potential. He finally convinced a company from Minnesota, led by Robert Whiteside to take the job.In 1932, Dr. McKenzie and Tom Rawn staked out the entire South East bay of Steep Rock. They then found a spot, sunk a shaft and found it was rich with high grade hematite. The mine was quickly abandoned as they had trouble keeping water out of it. In 1940, Tom sold 109 claims located west of Steep Rock to Midwest Iron Mining Corporation, and in March of that year, with 60 claims in his name, created Rawn Iron Mines Ltd. Four months later, on July 23, Rawn went out prospecting near Sapawe, and never returned. Parties searched for weeks, but his remains were never found.ForestryTimber was first noticed in the area as early as 1886. There were 31 surveys, with 21 being in Provincial Park and 10 being in the Clearwater and Otter Castle area. The first attempt at harvesting timber in the area was in the 1870s. A sawmill was located on the height of land east of the French Portage.The strip between Lac La Croix and French Lake held great potential for logging of red and white pine, however, the barren shores around Saganaga show that there were many fires there, with approximately one sixth of the total area having been destroyed by fires. These forest fires were usually caused by the carelessness of troops that passed through the area years before on the Dawson Trail. Smith described the aftermath as gigantic, half burned dead pines, which, towering in the air, add so much to the wildness and desolation of the scene and too often caused by the carelessness of explorers, prospectors, and hunters; The Indians are very careful to extinguish their fires during the dry season ... it is regretted that the fatal carelessness of the others cannot be checked. He noted that the pine in the unburnt area was excellent. The best trees were said to be found on Trout, Darkey, and Brent Lakes, and the farthest Southeast end of Sturgeon Lake.Recent historyBefore the 2nd World War, mineral exploration in the area determined the presence of a large, high grade, iron ore deposit at the bottom of Steep Rock Lake. After the war a large water diversion project on the Seine River system was undertaken to enable the draining and dredging of Steep Rock lake in order to develop mining operations.Atikokan is in the Central Time Zone but observes Central Daylight Time year round.  One explanation for this is that the late afternoon daylight in winter facilitated the loading of iron ore cars back when the mines were still in operation.  The practice continues and makes for dark mornings in the depth of winter until about 8:30am.Two large mines (Steep Rock Iron Mines and Caland Ore Co.) commenced operations in the late-1950s and continued for more than 30 years. When the mines closed in the early-1980s the town of Atikokan suffered economically but continued to survive on natural resource-based industries and tourism.In 1994, a 10 megawatt hydroelectric generating station (Falls Power) was developed on the Seine River diversion that had facilitated the opening of the mines 40 years earlier.()ClimateDemographicsPopulation trend:(Statistics Canada: 1996, 2001, 2006 census)* Population in 2006: 3293* Population in 2001: 3632* Population in 1996: 4043* Population in 1991: 4047EconomyAtikokans main employers are an Power Generation thermal power plant located 20 kilometres north of the community, the general hospital and (collectively)  its canoeing outfitters.   Recently, two forest product millsFibratech and Atikokan Forest Products (Located 30 kilometres east in Sapawe) were closed indefinitely due to the downturn in the wood industry.TransportationThe town is located off Highway 11, between Bay and Fort Frances. CN Rail runs through the town and operates a small yard south of the town. Municipal Airport is located to the northwest of the town. When Atikokan opened its first rail line, fares were $15.RecreationAtikokan was selected as the host site for the 2003 edition of Raid the North Extreme, a televised 6-day multi-sport expedition race that visits incredible wilderness locations across Canada.  A key factor in the selection was the proximity to the incredible paddling presented by Provincial Park.(Adventure Sports Magazine article 3rd Times a Charm, Oct 2003)EducationAtikokan is served by one school, one school and one school.

Hedley_on_the_Hill
 Hedley on the Hill is a village in Northumberland, west of Upon Tyne. It is located between the valley of the River Derwent, and the watershed to the Tyne.Despite being close to a major city, Hedley is typically Northumbrian and rural in character. Situated close to the villages of Stocksfield and Chopwell as well as to the rural market town of Hexham it is a small, placid village offering stunning views across the Tyne valley.Hedley is not typical of Northumberland in many respects. Firstly, it appears to have escaped rather unscathed in the wars between England and Scotland that occurred before the union. There are no records of any battles in the area. Similarly, there is no record of any activity involving border reivers (tribal leaders and outlaws that fought across the Scottish/English border) in the village. This has enabled it to develop in relative isolation, with mining and quarrying being the prominent industries since the eighteenth century. The village holds numerous events including the annual barrel race in which contestants, usually in pairs, run up the hill to the pub with a barrel of beer. It is also popular with gliding enthusiasts.Hedley on the Hill is also close to Wall a World Heritage Site and located in the far south of Hadrians Wall Country.Barrel Race is run every bank holiday Monday, and organised by The Feathers Inn. Competitors carry an empty nine-gallon beer barrel, over a 1.5 mile course Governance Hedley is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham.ReferencesExternal links* Brief summary of the village, from the official page of Hadrians Wall Country* Cumberland News | Easter offers a barrel of laughson the Hill

Polish_Canadians
related-c   Polonia, SlavsPolish Canadians are Citizens of Canada with Polish ancestry, and Poles who immigrated to Canada from abroad. According to the 2001 census by Canada, 984,585 Canadians claim full or partial Polish ancestry.(Canada, http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/ethnic/pages/Page.cfm?LangE&GeoPR&Code01&DataCount&Table2&StartRec1&Sort3&DisplayAll&CSDFilter5000, 2001 Census, last modified: 2005-01-25. Accessed 2008-01-03.)HistoryThe earliest Polish immigrants to Canada were members of the Watt and De Meuron military regiments from Saxony and Switzerland sent overseas to help the British Army in North America. Several were migrs from Poland who took part in the November Uprising of 1830 and the 1863 insurrection against the Russian occupation of their own homeland.(Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada, 2002, Archival Sources for the Study of Polish Canadians. Accessed 2008-01-03) The first Polish immigrant on record, Dominik Barcz, is known to have come to Canada in 1752. He was a fur merchant from Gdask who settled in Montreal. He was followed in 1757 by Blaskowicz, who worked as deputy surveyor-general of lands. In 1776 arrived army surgeon, Franz Globensky. His grandson, Auguste Maximilien Globensky was elected to the House of Commons in Ottawa in 1875. Image:IMG 0655.JPG|200px|right|250px|thumb||Sir Casimir S. Gzowski from Historic Sites of Ontario.200px|right|250px|thumb||Canada provinces 1867-1870.In 1841, Casimir Stanislaus Gzowski arrived in Canada from the partitioned Poland via U.S.A. and for 50 years worked in engineering, military and community sectors in Toronto and Ontario, for which he was knighted by Queen Victoria. Charles Horecki immigrated in 1872. He was an engineer with the cross-Canada railway construction from Edmonton to the Pacific Ocean through the Peace River Valley. Today, a mountain and a body of water in Columbia are named after him.Group-settlersThe first significant group of Polish group-settlers were Kashubians from Northern Poland, who were escaping Prussian oppression resulting from the occupation. They arrived in County of Ontario in 1858, where they founded the settlements of Wilno, Barrys Bay, and Lake (Ontario). By 1890 there were about 270 Kashubian families working in the Madawaska Valley of Renfrew County, mostly in the industry of the Valley. The consecutive waves of Polish immigrants in periods from 18901914, 19201939, and 1941 to this day, settled across Canada from Cape Breton to Vancouver, and made numerous and significant contributions to the agricultural, manufacturing, engineering, teaching, publishing, religious, mining, cultural, professional, sports, military, research, business, governmental and political life in Canada.Religious servicesAll Polish Canadians including their descendants are encouraged by organizations such as the Congress, to preserve their background and retain some ties with Poland and its people. In the past, the most significant role in the preservation of various aspects of Polish traditions and customs among the Polish communities in Canada fell for the Polish urban parishes, which retain the use of Polish language during services.(Henry Radecki,  Ethnic organizational dynamics: the Polish group in Canada. Page 102  Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press, 1979 - 275 pages) The first Polish Catholic priest visited Polish immigrants in 1862 in Kitchener. The first church serving Polish immigrants was built in 1875 in Wilno, Ontario. In Winnipeg, the Holy Ghost Church was built in 1899. The first Polish-Canadian Roman Catholic bishop is Reverend Mathew Ustrzycki, consecrated in June 1985, auxiliary bishop of the Hamilton Diocese. There are Polish-Canadian priests in many congregations and orders, such as the Franciscans, Jesuits, Redemptorists, Saletinians, Resurrectionists, Oblates, Michaelites, and the Society of Christ. In addition, 80 priests are serving in 120 parishes.Memorial to Katyn VictimsLargest Polish Canadian communitiesImage:Pope-jp-roncesvalles.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The John Paul II statue, TorontoImage:Roncesvalles Polish Fest 2008.JPG|200px|thumb|right|The largest Polish festival in Canada held in Toronto annuallyThe Victoria CrossNumerous Polish-Canadians have been recognized with awards and appointments by the Queen and the Canadian governments as well as universities and various organizations.

There is a forest reserve that begins 8 km from Mahenge town, called the Scarp Catchment Forest Reserve, established in 1954.  This forest has been heavily encroached upon for illegal logging and a planned graphite factory. There is also some mining of ruby gem stones.There is a hospital, a market, and primary schools. A Catholic Capuchin mission was established around 1897, and there is now a St. Francis Kasita Seminary at Mahenge. The Diocese of Mahenge was established in 1964. About 60 percent of the population are Catholic Christians.The dry season is June to October.  Water is generally scarce due to the limestone plateau, but despite this the area gives its name to the Toad (Mertensophryne loveridgei). The rare tree amaniensis is also found in this region.HistoryIt is an area very rich in ancient kimberlite crater lakes which yield many Paleogene fossils. Many new discoveries have been made there.In slaving times, the Mahenge area was notorious as the home of slave hunters.The capital of the African Republic was initially established in 1919 at Mahenge, as the region transitioned from German to British rule - but then moved to es Salaam.The major economic activities of the Mahenge population is agriculture.

Australian_workplace_agreement
Australian workplace agreements (AWAs) were formalized individual agreements negotiated by the boss and employee. Employers could offer take it or leave it AWAs as a condition of employment. They were registered by the employment advocate and did not require a dispute resolution procedure. These agreements such as performance evaluations, operate only at the federal level. AWAs were individual written agreements on terms and conditions of employment between an employer and employee in Australia, under the Relations Act 1996.  An AWA could override employment conditions in state or territory laws except for occupational health and safety, workers compensation or training arrangements. An AWA was required to  meet only the most minimal Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard.  Agreements were not required to include effective dispute resolution procedure, and could not include prohibited content. Agreements were for a maximum of five years; approved, promoted and registered by the Authority; operate to the exclusion of any award; and prohibit industrial action regarding details in the agreement for the life of the agreement. The introduction of the Australian Workplace Agreements was a controversial industrial relations issue in Australia.During a Senate Estimates hearing on 29 May 2006, Peter McIlwain, Head of the Office of the Employment Advocate (OEA) detailed that from a sample of 4 per cent, or 250, of the total 6,263 AWAs lodged during April 2006 after WorkChoices was introduced, that: 100% of AWAs removed at least one protected Award condition; 64% of AWAs have removed annual leave loadings; 63% of AWAs have stripped out penalty rates; 52% of AWAs have cut out shift loadings; 40% of AWAs have dropped gazetted public holidays; and 16% of AWAs, have slashed all award conditions and only the Governments five minimum conditions are satisfied.6 New AWAs were banned under the Fair Work Act 2009.CoverageAWAs had achieved coverage of about 2.4 % of the workforce as of May 2004(Employee Earnings and Hours, Australia, May 2004: Australian Bureau of Statistics). Mining companies have pushed the agreements with some success, offering substantial increases in pay to workers who chose to sign an AWA. According to OEA statistics, as of 31 December 2004, 1,410,900 persons were covered under Union Certified Agreements, 168,500 were covered under non-union Certified Agreements, and Australian Workplace Agreements had risen to 421,800, or over 21%. By 31 December 2005 this had risen to 1,618,200 under Union Certified Agreements, 185,300 under non-union Certified Agreements, and 538,200 Australian Workplace Agreements(Certified agreement and Australian workplace agreement coverage from estimates and statistics collated by of the Employment Advocate, Accessed 12 June 2006). Australian Bureau of Statistics figures published in March 2005 show that hourly wages of workers on AWAs were two percent lower than the hourly wages of workers on registered collective agreements, mostly negotiated by unions.(The impact on Workers of Australian Workplace Agreements by Professor David Peetz, June 2005. ABS Statistics show a two percent disparity in wages between AWAs and collective agreements - Page 11.) For women, AWAs paid 11 % less per hour than collective agreements.(The impact on Workers of Australian Workplace Agreements by Professor David Peetz, June 2005. Womens earnings 11% less under AWAs on Page 11.)The most common methods of setting pay for all employees were registered collective agreement (38.3%), unregistered individual arrangement (31.2%) and award only (20.0%). Unregistered collective agreement (2.6%) and registered individual agreement (2.4%) were the least common methods of setting pay. The remaining 5.4% of employees were working proprietors of incorporated businesses.(In the federal public service the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations reported that as of 31 December 2004, out of 124,500 public and parliamentary service permanent staff there were 11,085 AWAs (covering 1928 Senior Executive Service (SES), where AWAs are compulsory, and 9,157 other employees).(DEWR statistics on AWAs in the Federal Public Service from Union gets ready for hostile Senate by Verona Burgess, Financial Review, 8 April 2005, as published in CPSU bulletin April 2005) The rest of the permanent staff were covered, as at 30 March 2005, by 101 certified agreements, of which 70 were union enterprise agreements and 31 non-union enterprise agreements.(Percentage of Union and Non-union Certified Agreements in the Federal Public Service from Union gets ready for hostile Senate by Verona Burgess, Financial Review, 8 April 2005, as published in CPSU bulletin April 2005)According to a report in Australian newspaper in March 2007, about five per cent of the total workforce is employed on AWAs, with about 32 per cent of miners employed on AWAs, but this figure is much higher in Western Australia where up to 52 per cent are on AWAs. Rio Tinto pioneered individual employment contacts under common law in the 1980s in Western Australia with productivity improvements of between 20 and 35 per cent, according to Rio Tinto managing director Charlie Lenegan.(Employers Defend Howards AWAs Despite Slow Take-Up by Brad Norington & Andrew Trounson, The Australian, 31 March 2007, p. 33. http://www.careerone.com.au/jobs/job-search/job-market-insider/ripping-up-awas-could-cost-6-billion-dollars)Opposing viewsThe view of the union movement is that AWAs are an attempt to undermine the bargaining power of unions in the negotiation of pay and conditions of their members. Unions argue that the ordinary working person has little to no bargaining power by themselves to effectively negotiate an agreement with an employer, hence there is inherently unequal bargaining power for the contract. For exceptional individuals in a workplace, or industries with a labor shortage, the union movement argues that common law contracts are sufficient. They also believe that while commercial law and common law provides for fairness and equality of bargaining power, AWAs are designed to entrench inequality between an employer and their workforce with regard to pay and conditions. The policy of the ACTU is that AWAs should be abolished and that the bargaining system should contain collective bargaining rights.(ACTU policy on abolishing AWAs: ACTU Congress, Melbourne, 2003)Most unions warn their members to be very cautious about signing AWAs, and if they do so, to appoint the union as their bargaining agent. For example, the Services Union warns members: AWAs are about one thing: tipping the balance of power more firmly towards your employer and away from you.(Australian Services Union Accessed May 2005)In the Western Australian Parliament in May 2005, the Labor Minister for Consumer and Employment Protection stated his belief that  Australian Workplace Agreements are to be used to reduce wages and conditions of employment in Western Australia.(Question on AWAs reducing wages in WA directed to Mr J.C. KOBELKE, the Labor Minister for Consumer and Employment Protection, Western Australia in May 2005)The Howard Government and most business groups maintained that AWAs are mutually beneficial for employers and employees, often promoting the view that flexibility is paramount:AWAs give employers and employees flexibility in setting wages and conditions, and enable them to agree on arrangements that suit their workplaces and individual preferences. AWAs offer an employer and employees the opportunity to make an agreement that best suits the specific needs of individual employees. An existing employee cannot be forced to sign an AWA.(Description of AWA of the Employment Advocate, Accessed May 2005)In April 2007 The Sydney Morning Herald reported that it had received unpublished Government spreadsheets that showed 27.8% of the agreements had stripped away conditions that were intended to be protected by law()(). The spreadsheets were based on a sample of AWA agreements().In response to ongoing criticisms of WorkChoices and Australian Workplace Agreements, the Minister at the time Howard indicated the introduction of a new fairness test with an advertising campaign in May 2007 targeting women and youth which did not mention specifically either WorkChoices or AWAs.() However, the changes were not retrospective, leaving tens of thousands of workers on contracts that have removed conditions without the compensation that would be required under the current test.()  Former Prime Minister John Howard stated: Can I just say that it was never intentional that it should become the norm that penalty rates and overtime loadings should be traded off without proper compensation. The fairness test will guarantee in a very simple way that will not occur.()On 19 March 2008, a bill was passed in the Senate that prevented new AWAs from being made, and set up provisions for workers to be transferred from AWAs into intermediate agreements.(House of Reps seals death of WorkChoices - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation))See also*Council of Trade Unions*Fair Pay and Conditions Standard*federal election, 2007*industrial relations legislation, 2005*Industrial Relations Commission*labour movement*WorkChoicesNotesReferences* Workplace Relations Act (1996) via AustliiExternal links* Office of the Employment Advocate* ACTU Assistant Secretary, Richard Marles on Individual Contracts* Fair Go - NSW Government website on the changes* ACCI Workplace Relations Policy Blueprint
