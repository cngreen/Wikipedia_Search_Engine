Arthur_Windsor
Arthur Lloyd Windsor (c. 1833 - 20 January 1913) was an Australian journalist noted for his work on the The Argus and the Age.BiographyWindsor came from a Canadian family, owners of a sugar plantation in the Indies. He was born at sea on a voyage to Barbados, probably in 1833. His father died when he was five years old, and when he was about eight he was sent to school at Ottery, St Mary, Devonshire. He left school at 17, lived at Clifton and did some writing for the London press. He then returned to Barbados and for about 18 months taught at College. About the end of 1855 he went to Montreal and later to Glasgow. He worked as an army coach and also contributed to leading reviews; he had articles on Defoe and on Montaigne in the British Quarterly Review, in 1858. A collection of his articles was published in 1860, Ethica: or Characteristics of Men, Manners and Books.He was appointed editor of the Melbourne Argus not long afterwards, but resigned on a question of policy after holding the position for two and a half years. Windsor subsequently went to live at Castlemaine and edited the Mount Alexander Mail for three years. In 1872 he succeeded James Harrison as editor of The Age, and continued in this position for 28 years. It was a period of great importance for Victoria which saw the transition from a colony depending principally on the pastoral industry and gold-mining, to one in which agriculture and manufacturing were to be even more important. Syme, as proprietor of the Age, directed its policy, and there were periods when he practically ruled Victoria. Windsors vigorous and gifted mind was the medium through which Symes ideas were brought before the public. The literary power of his leaders and other contributions was strongly felt by their readers, and Windsors influence on the period marked him as one of the great journalists of his time. He retired in 1900 and lived at Melbourne until his death.References*

Lavoisier_Group
The Lavoisier Group is an organisation based in Australia that promotes scepticism of current scientific consensus  on global warming.  The organisation questions the fears of the of global warming, the idea that human activity causes it, and the wisdom of policies designed to curtail it.  They believe that political influence has trumped scientific truth, and that most of the scientists that support the theory that human activity is a cause of global warming do so because scientists that disagree with that prevailing belief lose access to government funding, the primary source of funds for any scientific study. The sources of funding for the group are not public, but the Morning Herald claimed it has links to many groups that have until recently been funded as part of the Mobil climate change skepticism campaign. That campaign recently ceased after a shareholder revolt.()The group was named after French scientist Lavoisier (1743-1794), the father of modern chemistry who  disproved the theory of combustion.CreationThe Lavoisier Group was created in response to submissions by the Australian Greenhouse Office to Cabinet to implement a carbon trading scheme. Its founders claimed that there had been very little ongoing public debate about these proposals... are of the view that the science behind global warming policy is far less certain than its protagonists claim, and we also believe that the economic damage which Australia would suffer, if a carbon tax of the magnitude canvassed in AGO documents were imposed, would be far, far greater than is currently appreciated in Canberra ( The Lavoisier Group)Following an inaugural conference in May 1999,(Hamilton, Clive.  Green conspiracy theory; An anti-greenhouse group has been taking its message to the extreme, conducting a systematic campaign to muddy the waters on climate science.  Canberra Times (Australia).  Jan. 10, 2002.) the group was founded in April 2000 by former Finance Minister Peter Walsh(Flannery, Tim Fridtjof.  The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth.  Atlantic Monthly Press.  2006.  p. 244.  ISBN 0-87113-935-9.), Webber, Ray Evans, Clough, Foster and Kean, with an opening address by supporter Hugh Morgan (The Lavoisier Group: Opening Address by Hugh Morgan). Secretary Ray Evans describes the 90-odd Lavoisier members as a dads army of mostly retired engineers and scientists from the mining, manufacturing and construction industries,() such as Paltridge and Plimer.  The annual subscription fee is 50 dollars, and the annual budget is 10,000 dollars.(The global warming sceptics.  Theage.com.au.  Nov. 27, 2004.  Retrieved Jan. 27, 2007.)AimsThe Lavoisier Group lists its aims as:# To promote vigorous debate within Australia on greenhouse science and greenhouse policy; # To ensure that the full extent of the economic consequences, for Australia, of the regime of carbon withdrawal prescribed by the yet-to-be-ratified Kyoto Protocol, are fully understood by the Australian community; # to explore the implications which treaties such as the Kyoto Protocol have for Australias sovereignty, and for the GATT/WTO rules which protect Australia (and other WTO members) from the use of trade sanctions as an instrument of extraterritorial power.Current activitiesThe Lavoisier Group continues to hold annual conferences, and the group has promoted a variety of theories contradicting the mainstream scientific positions on global warming, including the arguments of retired judge, amateur climatologist and astrologer Landscheidt,() whose work on solar cycles was used to argue that observed warming is based on solar cycles, and hence is not anthropogenic and will soon be reversed.Walsh has blamed politics for the current consensus on global warming.  The group claims that many scientists choose to endorse prevailing theories of global warming to protect their research funding by the government, a view that is held by French climatologist and author Leroux,() and was the subject of the book Meltdown: The Predictable Distortion of Global Warming by Scientists, Politicians, and the Media by Michaels. A supporter, former minister Staley, has characterised global warming as a form of correctness.(ResponsesAuthor Hamilton, is his book Scorcher, says that one can find the following arguments in the various papers promoted by the Lavoisier Group:()*There is no evidence of global warming.*If there is evidence of global warming, then it is not due to human activity.*If global warming is occurring and it is due to human activity, then it is not going to be damaging.*If global warming is occurring and it is due to human activity, and it is going to be damaging, then the costs of avoiding it are too high, so we should do nothing.Critics of the group have pointed out its ties to greenhouse gas emitters.() The groups top members have denied receiving compensation from industry, unlike some global warming skeptics in the United States, who have admitted to receiving compensation by fuel companies.(ReferencesExternal links* The Lavoisier Group website* Sourcewatch The Lavoisier Group

Thoresby_Hall
right|thumb|200px|The hall in 2007Thoresby Hall is one of Dukeries, four country houses and estates in north Nottinghamshire all occupied by dukes at one time in their history.The Pierrepont family acquired the Thoresby estate in 1633 and built the first grand house, attributed to Talman, in about 1670. It was destroyed by fire in 1745. Twenty years later John Carr in 17671772 built a new house on the same site but it was pulled down after just one hundred years when the celebrated Victorian country house architect Salvin designed the present house, erected  to the north between 18681874. The present building measures  on its east and south fronts and  on its west front. The impressive Great Hall, with minstrels gallery at the west end, is  long and  high. In the 20th century the house was threatened by subsidence caused by mining. To minimise the damage the buildings were sold in 1979 to the National Coal Board which chose to sell it on the open market ten years later. After passing through a number of owners it was acquired by Leisure Hotels which opened it as an hotel in 2000. The core of the Thoresby collection was retained by the family to furnish their new house nearby, while the remainder was sold at auction by Sothebys in 1989. The  Salvin house had a new bedroom wing added before opening as a 200-room country house hotel with spa facilities. The bulk of the Thoresby Estate is still in the hands of the Pierrepont family with only a few acres of immediately adjacent grounds and gardens being owned by the hotel; the family permits access along some footpaths close to the house, and others which are rights of way. Past residents include the of Kingston and the Manvers. It was the birthplace of Mary Pierrepont wife of Wortley Montagu.

Prince-Bishopric_of_Osnabrck
footnotes               The Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrck was a prince-bishopric centred on the Catholic Diocese of Osnabrck. The diocese was erected in 772 and is the oldest see founded by Charlemagne, in order to Christianize the conquered stem-duchy of Saxony.The temporal possessions of the see, originally quite limited, grew in time, and its prince-bishops exercised an extensive civil jurisdiction within the territory covered by their rights of Imperial immunity. The Prince-Bishopric continued to grow in size, making its status during the Reformation a highly contentious issue.In the Mediatisation of 1803, the Bishopric was dissolved and the secular or temporal power given to the Hanover branch of Brunswick-Lneburg; the see, the chapter, the convents and the Catholic charitable institutions were secularized. The territory of the see passed to Prussia in 1806, to the of Westphalia in 1807, to Napoleonic France in 1810, and again to Hanover in 1814. von Gruben, Bishop of Paros in Greece, was made apostolic, and as such cared for the spiritual interests of the Catholic population.The Latin (Roman) Catholic Diocese was restored in 1824, but henceforth its bishops would no longer wield any temporal power.HistoryThe first bishop of Osnabrck was Saint Wiho (785804)but it was the second bishop, Meginhard or Meingoz (80433), who truly organised the see.The temporal protectorate (; ) exercised over so many medival dioceses by laymen became, after the 12th century, hereditary in the Amelung family, from whom it passed to the Lion. After Henrys overthrow, it came into the possession of Count Simon of Tecklenburg and his descendants, though it was the source of many conflicts with the bishops. In 1236 the Count of Tecklenburg was forced to renounce all jurisdiction over the town of Osnabrck as well as the lands of the see, the chapter and the parish churches. On the other hand, the bishop and chapter, from the 13th century on, expanded their jurisdiction over many convents, churches and hamlets. Scarcely any other German see freed itself so thoroughly from civil jurisdiction within its territory. The royal prerogatives were transferred little by little to the bishop, e.g. the holding of fairs and markets, rights of toll and coinage, forest and hunting rights, mining royalties and fortresses so that, by the early part of the 13th century, the bishop was the real governor of the civil territory of Osnabrck. Among the prominent medival bishops were Drogo (95268); Conrad of Veltberg (1002); the learned Thietmar or Detmar (100322); II (106788); Johann I (100110), who built the actual cathedral in place of the wooden one destroyed by fire in the time of his predecessor; Diethard I (111937) was the first bishop elected by the free choice of the cathedral clergy; Philip II (114173) ended the conflicts between his see and the Abbeys of Corvey and Hersfeld; Arnold of Berg (113791) died a crusader at Akkon. In the time of Engelbert of Altena-Isenberg (122426, deposed following his implication in Archbishop II of Bergs assassination, rehabilitated 123850), Bruno of Altena-Isenberg (125059), and under Conrad II of Rietberg (126997) the new orders of Franciscans, Dominicans and Augustinians were received with favour. 14th to 16th centuries In the 14th and 15th centuries ,the power of the bishops waned before the increasing influence of the cathedral chapter, of the military servants (or knights) of the diocese, and of the town of Osnabrck. The last sought to free itself from the bishops sovereignty, but never became a Free City of the Empire. The see was almost continually engaged in warlike troubles and difficulties and had even to defend itself against the Bishops of Minden and Mnster. From the 14th century auxiliary bishops became necessary due to the civil duties that absorbed the attention of the Bishop himself. The successor of Bishop Conrad IV of Rietberg (14881508) was Eric of Brunswick (150832), simultaneously of Mnster and Paderborn. He opposed the Reformers strongly and successfully. Franz of Waldeck (153353), also of Minden, acted, on the contrary, a very doubtful part. He offered little resistance to Lutheranism in Mnster, though he vigorously opposed the Anabaptists; after 1543 he allowed in Osnabrck an evangelical service. However, the chapter and the Dominicans opposed a German service that dispensed with all the characteristics of the Roman Catholic Mass. In 1548, Bishop Franz promised to suppress the Reformation in Osnabrck and to execute the Interim, but fulfilled his promise very indifferently; on his deathbed he received Lutheran communions. His successor, John IV of Hoya (155374), was more Catholic, but was succeeded by three bishops of a Protestant mind: III of Saxony (157485), Bernhard of Waldeck (158591), and Philip Sigismund (15911623). Under them the Reformation overran nearly the whole diocese.  17th and 18th centuries In 1624, Cardinal Eitel Frederick of Hohenzollern became Bishop of Osnabrck and called in the Jesuits. But he had scarcely begun his work when he died, and left to his successor, of Wartenberg (162561), the task of executing the Counter-Reformation. The city-council was purged of anti-Catholic elements and the former Augustinian convent was turned over to the Jesuits. The Edict of Restitution was executed successfully by him and in 1631 he founded a university at Osnabrck.But in 1633, Osnabrck was captured by the Swedes, the university was discontinued, Catholic religious exercises suppressed, and the see (163351) administered by the conquerors. By the of Westphalia in 1648, the bishop succeeded in preventing the secularisation of the see, as contemplated by the Swedes. Nevertheless, it was stipulated that henceforth a Catholic and a Protestant bishop (of the Confession) would alternately hold the see. During the those periods of rule by a Protestant bishop, always chosen from the ducal House of Brunswick-Lneburg, the spiritual care of the Catholics was committed to the of Cologne.Wartenberg was made cardinal in 1660 and was succeeded by the married Protestant bishop, Ernest Augustus (166198), who transferred the residence to Hanover. He was succeeded by the Catholic bishop, Prince Joseph of Lorraine, of Olmtz, later of Trier (16981715). The Protestant Bishop Ernest Augustus (171528) was succeeded by August of Bavaria, Archbishop-Elector of Cologne (172861). The last bishop, Prince Frederick of Great Britain (17641803), later of York, was, until his majority (1783), under the guardianship of his father, George III, monarch of the United Kingdom and Hanover.  Prince Frederick was only six months old when he was appointed bishop. Residence From about 1100, after the fire which destroyed the cathedral in Osnabrck the Bishops had their residence in the castle of Iburg. This period ended when Ernest Augustus built a baroque castle in Osnabrck, the castle being was finished in 1673.Bishops* Wiho I. ( Wicho I) 783 to 1. April 809* Meginhard 810 to 12.

Sutro_Tunnel
thumb|The entrance to the Sutro Tunnel in the late 1800sThe Sutro Tunnel is a drainage tunnel connected to the Lode in Northern Nevada. It begins at City, Nevada and empties approximately 6 miles southeast near the town of Nevada.The tunnel was first envisioned by Sutro in 1860. He promoted the drainage tunnel in order to allow access to deeper mineral exploration in the Comstock. Mine flooding and inadequate pumps had inhibited some exploration activities up to that time.By 1865, Sutros idea had gained the approval of state and federal legislation. The mining interests of the Comstock also initially supported the tunnel project, but later strongly opposed the idea. They feared that an alternate access point to the Comstock minerals would threaten their monopoly on the mining and milling of gold and silver in the Comstock.Nonetheless, Sutro formed the Sutro Tunnel Company, selling certificates to raise funds for its construction, which began in 1869. Financing also came from local miners under the guise of improved mine safety. This was further advocated (perhaps exploited) by Sutro after the Yellowjacket mine disaster where dozens of miners were burned to death because they could not escape the mine.De Wint Foote worked on the tunnel in 1873, but was fired in 1874, having struck a flood of water in Shaft No. 2.()The main tunnel was completed in 1878.  By that time, however, the Comstock mine had gone deeper, using newer improved pumps, and was also thinning out. Lateral tunnels were also created to enhance drainage and ventilation. Upon completion, Adolph Sutro immediately sold his interest in the tunnel company and moved to Francisco, later becoming mayor of that city.The Sutro Tunnel pioneered the excavation of large drainage and access tunnels in the United States.  Later US mine drainage tunnels included the Tunnel at Springs, Colorado, the Leadville and Yak tunnels at Leadville, Colorado, and the Roosevelt tunnel in the Cripple Creek district, Colorado.References

Missouris_8th_congressional_district
Missouris 8th Congressional District is one of 435 congressional districts in the United States and one of nine congressional districts in the state of Missouri. The district encompasses rural Southeast Missouri and South Central Missouri as well as some counties in Southwest Missouri. The district stretches from as far south as the Bootheel north to the St. Louis exurbs of Farmington and surrounding areas in the Belt and as far east as the counties along the River to as far west along the Plateau near Branson. The district is anchored in Cape Girardeau. A predominantly rural district, MO-08 is heavily Republican at the federal level. In 2004, President W. Bush received 63% of the vote in the district over Senator Kerry (D-Massachusetts) who clinched 36%; four years later in 2008, Senator McCain (R-Arizona) carried the district with 61.92% over Senator Obama (D-Illinois) who received 36.42%. The district is currently represented by Representative Ann Emerson, a Republican from Cape Girardeau. Emerson was first elected to the seat in a special election in 1996 following the death of her husband Emerson, a Republican who had held the seat until his death. No Democrat has held the seat in Congress in nearly 30 years. In 2010, however, Emerson faced her best-funded Democratic challenger to date in Sowers, a political science professor at the Missouri University of Science & Technology in Rolla. CQPolitics.com rated the seat as Safe Republican, meaning that the incumbent was all but sure to retain the seat. On November 2, 2010, Emerson defeated Sowers by 66% to 29%.CharacterMissouris 8th is a relatively diverse congressional district. Although it is fairly conservative and Republican-leaning at the federal level, Democrats often perform well here in local and state elections. Clinton, a Democrat from neighboring Arkansas, managed to carry the 8th District both times in 1992 and 1996 by strong margins, but since then, the district solidly supported Republicans George W. Bush and John McCain in the past three presidential elections. The district did, however, back former Attorney General and now Governor Nixon (D) over Republican Hulshof in Missouris gubernatorial election in 2008. At the local level, Democrats control a majority of elected offices in Southeast Missouri. Republicans control more local offices in the more extreme-western portions of the district namely in Southwest Missouri. In presidential elections, Democratic candidates often run best in the Bootheel, which is the most impoverished region in the district (and the state, for that matter) and contains a significant number of Americans, as well as the Lead Belt region which contains a core constituency of unions and mining.

Thomas_James_Brown
Thomas James Brown (12 August 1886 &ndash; 10 November 1970) was a British coal miner and Labour Party politician. During a 22-year career in Parliament he became known as the miners champion, fighting for compensation for those suffering from industrial diseases, and to improve state pensions.MinerBrown was born in Leigh, in the centre of the Lancashire coalfield. He went to the Brunswick School and Leigh Technical School, but as with most of the local men, he began work in the coal mines at the age of 12 in 1898. He joined the Lancashire Miners Federation and the Labour Representation Committee in 1903. Political careerIn 1919 Brown was elected to Hindley Urban District Council, of which he was twice Chairman before standing down in 1945. He also became a of the Peace for Lancashire in 1922; he held this appointment for forty years before going off the active list. He was on the Executive Committee of the Federation of Great Britain from 1922 to 1938. In 1937 he received a promotion at the mine and became a Miners Agent instead of working underground; he was an exchange delegate to the French Miners Congress in 1938.Election to ParliamentAs Vice-President of the and Cheshire Miners Federation, Brown won the Miners Federation nomination for the vacated seat of Ince where the sitting of Parliament (MP) was made a Regional Controller for the Ministry of Fuel and Power. Browne was elected unopposed.He concentrated on the problems of the mining industry and miners, calling for the abolition of the means test for retired miners. Along with the majority of Labour backbenchers, Brown voted against the wartime governments decision to postpone implementation of the Beveridge report. He called for increases in the level of the state pension.CampaignsBrown was allied with the left on issues such as the grant to members of the Royal family and continuing Service. He especially campaigned for compensation to ex-miners suffering from lung diseases, and welcomed moves by the government in 1954 to institute a compensation scheme. In 1956 he argued strongly against a Bill which would allow licensed premises at airports to sell alcohol, saying that there was much evidence of aircraft being endangered by drink-sodden passengers. Brown was specifically concerned with protecting pensioners from increases in the price of cigarettes, and moved an amendment to the 1956 budget to exempt pensioners from the rise in cigarette duty.In 1958 Brown, then chairman of the Lancashire and Cheshire group of Labour MPs, organised a delegation to the government calling for a complete prohibition of textile imports from Kong, Pakistan and India. The group argued that these goods were produced by sweated labour, and that the Lancashire textile industry needed protection. A strong supporter of state ownership of the mining industry, Brown rejected moves to restrict the borrowing power of the Coal Board.RetirementIn poor health and in his mid seventies, Brown announced in August 1961 his decision not to fight the next election on doctors advice. In 1962, having come out of hospital to attend a debate on nurses pay, he declared he felt as walked out that he would have been willing to give nurses the whole Treasury.References*M. Stenton and S.

Slave_insurance_in_the_United_States
Slave insurance in the United States has become a matter of historical and legislative interest.  In the history of in the United States, a number of insurance companies wrote policies insuring slave owners against the loss, damage, or death of their slaves.  The fact that a number of insurers continue the businesses that serviced these policies has brought attention to this history.Attorney Deadria Farmer-Pallmann discovered an 1852 circular that named insurers that serviced some of these policies. National Loan Fund Life Assurance Company distributed a circular entitled. A Method by Which Slave Owners May Be Protected From Loss which named The Merchants Bank and The Leather Manufactures Bank as institutions able to pay and adjust claims. Under a typical policy a slave could be insured for $500.00 with an annual premium of about $11.25.Disclosure legislationOn September 30, 2000 Governor Davis of California signed two bills relating to slave insurance.  One bill was written by former California State Senator Hayden.(Slavery Era Insurance Registry Report from the California Department of Insurance)  The California legislature found that::Insurance policies from the slavery era have been discovered in the archives of several insurance companies, documenting insurance coverage for slaveholders for damage to or death of their slaves, issued by a predecessor insurance firm. These documents provide the first evidence of ill-gotten profits from slavery, which profits in part capitalized insurers whose successors remain in existence today.(Calif. SB2199 Sec. 1(a)., quoted online at Consumers:Slavery Era Insurance Registry at the California Department of Insurance)The California insurance commissioner has the power to request slave insurance policies from insurance companies doing business in California.  A second bill, which is called UC Slavery Colloquium Bill(SB 111737) allows the University of California the option to hold a conference on the economics of slavery. Important organizations such as Jacksons Rainbow/PUSH and the NAACP supported these bills. In California and other states calls have been made to verify any documents that showed profits from slavery on the part of capitalized insurers whose successors remain in existence today.Part of Governor Davis Bill included: 13810 The Commissioner shall request and obtain information in the state regarding any records of slave-holder insurance. Next the Commissioner shall obtain the names of any slave holders or slaves described in the insurance records. Also each insurer licensed and doing business in the state must show any insurance policies issued to slave-holders  that provided coverage for damage to or death to their slaves. Last any slaves whose ancestors owners were compensated for damages by insurers are entitled to full disclosure. Articles 12810,13811, 13812, 13813 part of the California Code of Regulations,Tile 10, Sections 2393-2398 implement the statute.While researching coal mining history, an author recently discovered additional information regarding the use of life insurance policies for coal mining slaves.  These policies provided a risk-free opportunity for the owners to lease slaves; but it was far from risk-free for the slaves who were forced to work in the extremely hazardous conditions of the mines.   Insurance companies even wrote policies on 12-year-old slaves who labored underground in the mines.(Frantel, Nancy C. Chesterfield County Virginia Uncovered, The Records of Death and Slave Insurance Records for the Coal Mining Industry, 1810-1895.

Shaba_I
casualties2UnknownShaba I was a conflict between the neighbouring states of Zaire and Angola in 1977, and was arguably a consequence of Zaires support for the FNLA and UNITA factions in the Civil War.The conflict began on March 8, 1977 when about 2,000 members of the for the National Liberation of the Congo (FLNC), invaded Shaba province in south western Zaire, with the support of Angolas MPLA government and the possible involvement of Cuban troops.  President Sese Seko of Zaire appealed for outside support on April 2.( The war ended when 1,500 Moroccan troops, airlifted into Zaire on April 10 by the government, beat back the FNLC.(Chris Cook and John Stevenson. The Routledge Companion to World History Since 1914, 2005. Pages 321-322.) The attack led to government reprisals, which led to the mass exodus of refugees as well as further political and economic instability within Zaire itself.The FLNC carried out a second invasion (II), the following year.In the Oriental and Kivu provinces, the United Nations peacekeepers were defeated and later on, 50,000 soldiers and civilians were killed in the conflict.BackgroundIncluded in the invading force was a small remnant of the Katangan gendarmes that had supported the secession of Katanga from Congo under the leadership of Tshombe in 1960. When Kasavubu recalled Tshombe from exile in 1964, elements of this force had been incorporated into the Congolese National Army (Arme National Congolaise or ANC) to help fight the insurrections simmering throughout the country. After Tshombe disappeared from the political scene, the Katangan contingent mutinied in 1966 and again in 1967. When these uprisings failed, most of the contingent left for Angola under Nathaniel Mbumbas leadership. During the late 1960s, the former gendarmes began to congregate in Angola along Zaires southern border, and during the late 1960s and early 1970s, they fought for the Portuguese against Angolan nationalist movements. After the Portuguese departed in 1975, the MPLA enlisted the rebel Zairians in their cause and continued to arm and train them. It was the remnants of this force, augmented by other Zairian dissidents from Shaba and elsewhere, and still led by Mbumba, which invaded Shaba in 1977.InvasionThe invaders launched a three-pronged attack on March 8, 1977. Within weeks the FLNC had captured several towns and controlled the rail road to a point thirty kilometres from the copper-mining town of Kolwezi. Shortly after the invasion began, the dissidents made it clear that they were not merely a reincarnation of the earlier Katangan secessionist movement but instead aimed to take over the entire country and depose Mobutu. After their initial success, the rebels stalled on their way to Kolwezi; nevertheless, Mobutus position seemed dire. This rapid advance and the threat to Kolwezi forced Mobutu to appeal for international assistance.Belgium, France, and the States responded to Mobutus request by immediately airlifting military supplies to Zaire. Other African states also supported Zaire during this crisis, and Egypt and Morocco joined Belgium, France, and the United States by providing assistance. Egypt provided 50 pilots and technicians. The pilots flew the French-built Mirage jets of the Zairian air force throughout the conflict. Morocco provided 1,500 combat troops. French aircraft airlifted these soldiers to Kolwezi on April 9, and on April 14, a combined Zairian and Moroccan force counter-attacked. This reinforcement immediately improved the FAZs morale, and by the end of May the joint force had regained control of Shaba. In addition to the recapture of Shaba, the Moroccan presence had the added benefit of permitting Mobutu to keep his elite airborne units in Kinshasa, ready to respond to a crisis elsewhere in the country.WithdrawalThe invading force had expected a general uprising in support of its operation; however, because of the fragmentation of Zairian opposition groups, as well as the FLNCs distinctive ethnic base (Lunda and Ndembu), this uprising did not materialize. The FLNC was prevented from consolidating its gains and became susceptible to the Zairian-Moroccan counter-attack. Nevertheless, during what came to be known as the Eighty-Day War, the FLNC suffered no serious defeats, its troop strength had not diminished significantly, and its capability to conduct insurgent operations remained intact. The FLNC withdrew to Angola, and possibly to Zambia, and began to regroup for another attack. Thus, although to a limited extent the crushing of Shaba I might be regarded as a model of international cooperation, the victorious forces failed to complete the job. Probably more significant, however, was Zaires failure to follow up its military success with political and economic reforms to ensure long-term stability. Government reprisals after Shaba I drove 50,000 to 70,000 refugees to Angola. Also, Zaires continued support for Angolan dissident groups ensured continued Angolan government support for the FLNC.Impact on Zaires militaryThe poor performance of Zaires military during Shaba I gave evidence of chronic weaknesses. One problem was that some of the Zairian soldiers in the area had not received pay for extended periods. Senior officers often kept the money intended for the soldiers, typifying a generally disreputable and inept senior leadership in the FAZ. As a result many soldiers simply deserted rather than fight. Others stayed with their units but were ineffective.During the months following the Shaba invasion, Mobutu sought solutions to the military problems that had contributed to the armys dismal performance. He implemented sweeping reforms of the command structure, including wholesale firings of high-ranking officers. He merged the military general staff with his own presidential staff and appointed himself chief of staff again, in addition to the positions of minister of defence and supreme commander that he already held. He redeployed his forces throughout the country instead of keeping them close to Kinshasa, as had previously been the case. The Kamanyola Division, at the time considered the armys best unit and referred to as the presidents own, was assigned permanently to Shaba. In addition to these changes, the armys strength was reduced by 25%, presumably to eliminate disloyal and ineffective elements. Zaires allies provided a large influx of military equipment, and Belgian, French, and American advisers assisted in rebuilding and retraining the force.ReferencesBibliography*Sandra W.

 governing_body  Department of Fish and GameThe Spenceville Wildlife Area is an  wildlife preserve managed by the Department of Fish and Game.  It is approximately  east of the town of Marysville and Air Force Base in central California. Natural historySpenceville is a foothill oak and grassland area notable for many species of birds and wildflowers; for example the poppy Mariposa Lily, luteus is found in the Spenceville Wildlife Area.(C. Michael Hogan. 2009) The area was originally home to the Maidu and Nisenan Native Americans and evidence of their grinding holes and pits still exist.The geology of the Spenceville area is part of the Smartsville Block formed during the Middle Jurassic period 200 million years ago. The Smartsville Block is a part of the California Mother Lode and consequently, Spenceville has had its share of mining activity.(State of California. 2007) Cleanup from copper and zinc mining continues to this day.Current issuesSpenceville hosts a variety of activities: hiking, biking, hunting, hunting dog field trials, target shooting, camping, equestrian trail riding, birding and primitive camping. A popular trail leads to a double waterfall called Fairy Falls (a.k.a. Beale Falls, Shingle Falls, or Dry Creek Falls).The Spenceville Wildlife Area may be impacted by the Waldo Dam Project proposed by the County Water Agency and by housing development proposed between Air Force Base and the wildlife area.Take caution for a high level of rattlesnakes.Line notesReferences* Spenceville State Wildlife Area* California Department of Fish and Game.

He graduated from Tokyo Commercial School (now University) in 1885, and graduated from University in 1889.As a businessmanThrough an investment from his uncle Fujita, Kuhara purchased the Hitachi Mine, formerly the Akasawa Silver Mine, in December 1905, and in two years it grew to become one of the four largest copper mines in Japan at the time. Using the success of this investment, in 1912, Kuhara founded Kuhara Trading Co., Ltd. In 1915, copper poisoning in the area prompted Kuhara to knock down the shorter, older smoke stack in favour of a chimney 155 metres tall (the tallest chimney in the world at that time) It was built on the top of a mountain near the refinery. In this regard, Kuhara was the first to make use of the upper-layer air current. Unfortunately for Kuhara, Japanese economy began caving in as War I and War II developed, and after the Great Kant earthquake destroyed a number of his investments, he fell into debt, finally closing in 1928.As a politicianKuhara had, from prior to the war had been a syndicalist.

Mervyn_Thompson
Mervyn Garfield Thompson (1936 - 1992) was a prominent Zealand playwright and director. He was one of the founders of Court Theatre in Christchurch, an artistic director of Theatre in Wellington and Writer in Residence at the of Canterbury. His theatrical writing championed the downtrodden and featured a revival and refinement of the genre of songspiel. He is regarded as one of New Zealands most significant and controversial playwrights.LifeThompson was born in the small mining town of Kaitangata in South Otago. His family moved to the West Coast where he variously lived in mining towns such as Reefton and Runanga. he left school at the age of 15 and spent 5 years working as a coal miner. during this period he first became involved in amateur dramatics.He attended Canterbury University in his twenties, studying English, and came under the influence of Marsh. He played the role of Proculeius in her 1959 production of and Cleopatra, from which he earned the nickname Proc which stuck for the rest of his life.Graduating with an MA in 1964, he became a university lecturer in 1965.Thompson died of throat cancer in 1991. He had one son, who is autistic.TheatreIn 1970, Thompson and Bromley proposed the founding of a professional theatre in Christchurch, following the earlier establishment of Downstage in Wellington and Mercury Theatre in Auckland. (Harcourt, Peter: A Dramatic Appearance: New Zealand Theatre 1920 - 1970. Methuen 1978 ISBN 456 02410 7).ControversyIn February 1984, Thompson, then a lecturer at Auckland University, was abducted, threatened to have his penis cut off(http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id1&objectid10681052), and left tied to a tree in an Auckland park wearing a sign labelling him a rapist. The abduction was allegedly staged by a feminist action group based at the University following an accusation by one of his students. Thompson vigorously denied the accusation, admitting he had an affair with the student but claiming it was consensual. The abduction imitates the plot of a stage play Setting the Table by Renee, a friend of Thompsons. Thompson had acted as dramaturg at the workshopping of the play. The incident made headlines for some time(In an essay entitled Whipping up a local culture: Masochism and the cultural nationalists academic Patrick Evans said the public rape of Thompson was probably the most successful planned interruption of the status quo this country has ever seen, sending a shudder through New Zealand manhood that permanently transformed gender relations in New Zealand universities (for example) overnight and - aided by the victims unquenchable desire to talk about it in public- threw into the public arena the entire issue of how men have related to women over the years.) and had a major impact on Thompsons career, with protests at many performances of his solo show Coaltown Blues.Playswith date of premiere production O!

thumb|Thomas Messinger DrownThomas Messinger Drown (March 19, 18421904) was the fourth President of University in Pennsylvania.BackgroundHe was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1842. He graduated high school in 1859. He studied medicine at the of Pennsylvania and graduated in 1862. He went abroad to Germany to study chemistry in Saxony, and mining at the of Heidelberg. From 1869 to 1870 he was an instructor of metallurgy at University. In 1872 he was doing research in his private laboratory back in his hometown of Philadelphia, where he would hire a former student as an assistant Townsend Baker. From 1874 to 1881 he was the chair of Chemistry at College. Baker followed him to Lafayette and later would found the T. Baker Chemical Co., which merged with Mallinckrodt and was absorbed and spun off of International as a component company of Covidien.MIT and the Board of Health Lawrence Experiment StationDrown then held a leadership post in chemistry at the Institute of Technology. He helped start MITs engineering curriculum in the late 1880s. In 1887 he was appointed by the newly-formed Massachusetts Board of Health to a landmark study of sanitary quality of the states inland waters. As Consulting Chemist to the Massachusetts State Board of Health, he was in charge of the famous Experiment Station laboratory conducting the water sampling, testing, and analysis. There he put to work the environmental chemist and first female graduate of MIT, Swallow Richards. This research created the famous normal chlorine map of Massachusetts that was the first of its kind and was the template for others. As a result, Massachusetts established the first water-quality standards in America, and the first modern treatment plant was created. As a professor, Drown published a number of papers on metallurgy, mostly in of the American Institute of Engineers.Dr. Drown was founder of the American Institute of Mining Engineers. He served as its secretary, and editor of its Transactions from 1871 till 1884. He was elected their president in 1897.Lehigh presidencyIn 1895 he left MIT to become the fourth President of University. Lehighs endowment was predominantly in the stock of the major company of its founder, Packers Valley Railroad. The of 1893 crashed the market, brought the country into depression that lasted years, and nearly brought the university to financial insolvency. Many prominent railroads such as the Pacific Railway, the Pacific Railroad and the Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad went into bankruptcy, and over 15,000 companies and 500 banks failed. In order to gain new sources of funding, President Drown broke the universitys ties with the Episcopal Church in 1897, qualifying the university for aid from the of Pennsylvania.  During his term, which started during a major financial crisis, he was able to save Lehigh from bankruptcy, grow enrollment, grow academics, and build. Williams Hall was completed. The curriculum leading to a degree in arts and engineering was established, as was the department of zoology and biology. New curricula were adopted in metallurgical engineering, geology, and physics. In 1904 Dr. Drown died, effectively ending his term.In 1908, Lehigh University opened up Drown Hall which houses Lehighs English Department.External links*About Lehigh - Past to Present - Past Presidents*Lehigh inaugurations bridge past, future*SERMON IN STONE Packer Memorial Church: An Historical Essay*Purity by the ounce J.

Nortonville,_California
footnotes               Nortonville is a former settlement in Contra Costa County, California. It was located on Kirker Creek  north-northeast of Diablo,() at an elevation of 801 feet (244 m).Nortonville was founded by Norton in 1855.(The move of coal miners from Nortonville, California to Black Diamond, Washington Territory, 1885 by Jacqueline Byer Dial, 1980.) He, along with three partners named Cutler, Matheson and Sturgis, started the Black Diamond coal mine at Nortonville in 1860.(Letter from Contra Costa County, Daily Alta California, Dec. 10, 1860.)  The mine was incorporated as the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company in June, 1861.(Another Coal Mining Company, Daily Alta California, June 15, 1861.)(History; The Company, southport-land.com/history. Retrieved 2011-02-02.)Nortonville was also the southern terminus of the six mile long Diamond Coal Mining Railroad (also known as the Black Diamond Railroad), built in 1868.(Third Annual Report of the Board of Railroad Commissioners of the State of California for the Years ending December 31, 1880-81-82, pages 345-348.)  The railroad connected Nortonville with the San Joaquin River, at Black Diamond Landing, California, with a stop at California (the latter two towns are now a part of the city of California). The town was home to many Welsh miners.( In 1885 the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company moved all the coal miners from Nortonville to another of the Companys mines at Black Diamond, Territory.(( The Nortonville mine was so deep that it acted as a drain for the surrounding mines, and when the owners of the other mines refused to contribute to the cost of pumping out the water, the Company simply shut down and moved its operations.(Bruce Cornwall, Life Sketch of Pierre Barlow Cornwall, (1906), p. 67.) Currently what is left behind at Nortonville is a deserted area.  The brick foundation of the mines hoisting works, remnants of the railroad bed, and an old Cemetery( are all the remain. The cemetery is known as the Rose Hill Cemetery, which was named for Emma Rose, daughter of Hayward, who was president and chief stockholder of the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company.(Rose Hill Cemetery & The Mt. Diablo Coalfield, Diablo Watch, Spring 2005, No. 39.) In the 1940s Mrs. Rose donated the cemetery to the County.(Four other coal mining towns were established in the same mining district: Somersville, Stewartsville, West Hartley and Judsonville.(A post office operated at Nortonville from 1874 to 1910, with closures in 1887 and from 1890 to 1891.(LocationNortonville is located on Somersville Road just outside the city of Antioch in Contra Costa County.  The town site is now part of the Diamond Mines Regional Preserve.References*External links* Nortonville Nortonville on ghosttowns.com.*  Life Sketch of Pierre Barlow Cornwall, written by his son Bruce Cornwall, 1906.* History; The Company (history of the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company).

Fochriw
Fochriw is a village located in County Borough, Wales. It was well known for its neighbouring collieries, which employed nearly the entire local population in the early 20th century. It lies within the historic county boundaries of Glamorgan. The village appears as the backdrop on the Wales sitcom High Hopes credits. HistoryFochriws growth was germinated to a lesser extent by the Rhymney Iron Companys requirement for ironstone, and to a greater extent by the Ironworks requirement for coal, which was converted into coke, an essential ingredient in the production of iron.Over a period of about 130 years, the landscape changed from rural to industrial, and back to rural, as it is today. However, the latter changes did not take place until relatively recently when nearly all the remnants of the mining industry were removed from around the village. The memories of the industrial landmarks, or eyesores, that remained following the closure of the Fochriw and South Tunnel collieries are only retained by those of a certain age, and the younger generation no longer have the experience of living in a community which is centred around coal.LocationFochriw is a typical Wales Valleys coal mining village that developed from its rural existence by the need for iron and coal during the 19th century. It is located on the north-east flank of Mynydd Fochriw at the head of the Bargoed Fach (now called the Darran) valley, approximately  north of Bargoed, and  south east of Tydfil. The village straddles two ancient hamlets in the parish of Gelligaer, these being the Ysgwyddgwyn and Brithdir hamlets, the dividing line being the brook (Bargoed Fach) which flows in the bottom of the valley. The boundaries of these hamlets were walked by a number of parishioners of the parish on 24th day of May, 1750, and a document detailing the boundaries of each hamlet, namely Keven, Hengode, Garthgynyd, Ysgwyddgwyn, and Brithdecr (Brithdir) was produced, extracts of same are reproduced below.Origin of the nameIt was identified as Brohru Carn in the 12th century, and a reference to Fforch y Rhiw is made in the book Parish of Gelligaer by T.V. Davies, in the section dealing with Roman History and the route of Heol Adam. It states that The holding called Fforch y Rhiw is mentioned in several Gelligaer leases of the 17th century. The name probably arises from a number of old tracks in the Brithdir Hamlet which tend to converge near Fochriw.It has also been known as Boch Rhiw Carn, Ffochreiw, Fochrhiw, Vochriw, Vochrhiw, and, currently, Fochriw. The interpretation of the name from an my original Fochriw family was Foch Y Rhiw Pentwyn Mawr which translates in English to : the cheek of the slope of the head hill (Pentwyn Mountain). This seems to describe the villages actual location.Educationthumb|Fochriw Primary SchoolThe first school in the area was a National School at Pentwyn. It was opened in 1856 by the Gellygaer Charities which were left to the parish by Edward Lewis of Gilfach Bargoed in 1715.The new school was opened in July 1910 and was attended for instruction by the scholars for the first time on the first Monday of September 1910. In April 1911 a half acre of land adjacent to the existing school was bought for 20. It was not until September 1912 that a letter was written to the building committee of the County Council recommending that a new school be built.On 1 April 1971 both Infants and Junior schools combined under one Head Teacher to become Fochriw Primary School. A Nursery was opened at Plantation Terrace in 1973.See also*ValleyBibliography*Evans, Marion, (1994), A Portrait of Rhymney with cameos of Pontlottyn, Tafarnaubach, Princetown, Abertysswg and Fochriw, volume 1.

Cracow,_Queensland
BiloelaCracow is a gold mining town in Queensland, Australia, in the Banana Shire Local Government Area.  The town is located on the Theodore - Eidsvold road, 485 kilometres north west of the state capital, Brisbane.  The town was named for a pastoral run, named in 1851 by pastoralist, John Ross, presumably for the Polish city of Krakw.()  However, in a book detailing the towns history, which was published in/around 1992/1993, Cracow got its name from the sound a whip makes (cracko). At the 2006 census, Cracow and the surrounding area had a population of 123.()Gold was first discovered in Cracow in 1875 by itinerant fossickers and a further discovery of a nugget was made by an Aboriginal man in 1916. In 1931, the Golden Plateau mine was established and it operated continuously until 1976.()At its gold mining peak, the town included five cafes, barber shop, billiard saloon, two butchers, a picture theatre and a soft drink factory.() The closure of the mine led to Cracow becoming a town with many deserted houses and shops. The local hotel is one of the only remaining retail business, as it attracts a lot of tourists due to its unusual array of strange artifacts adorning the ceilings and walls. The other business was the General Store, which doubled as a post office and video store. In 2004, Mining reestablished gold mining in the town, leading to hopes the town may recover.()ReferencesExternal links* University of Queensland: Queensland Places: Cracownl:Cracowpl:Cracow

Center_for_Adaptive_Systems_Applications_(CASA)
The Center for Adaptive Systems Applications (CASA) was a company founded in 1995 by physicists ( Roger Jones, Robert Stellingwerf, Camilo Gomez, and Stephen Coggeshall) and a business developer (John Davies) from Alamos National Laboratory.(News story at Los Alamos National Laboratory) The company was one of several companies that spun off from Los Alamos and the Fe Institute that focused on banking, finance, and retail applications.  CASA applied learning, adaptive computation, and other mining techniques to the prediction of behavior. The first applications were in consumer banking, specifically the prediction of bankruptcy and credit card delinquency for Citibank. The product offerings and projects expanded into smart agriculture, retail products, and management consulting. The company was acquired by  HNC Software in March 2000 at the peak of the boom.(News story at www.kdnuggets.com) HNC Software was subsequently acquired by Isaac Corporation.(Fair Isaac web page) Much of the technology developed at CASA became part of the  credit scoring offerings of Isaac.Former CASA employees founded at least four lines of companies: * a series of companies that eventually became Qforma that specializes in healthcare applications, * Strategic Analytics that has analytic products in consumer banking, eventually acquired by Analytics, * Stellingwerf Consulting that has analytic products in aerospace, energy, and defense,* a line of companies that provided analytics for business loans, eventually sold to S&P.See also:Jones (physicist and entrepreneur):Mesa:Company:BiosGroup:WeiningerReferences(

University_of_Santo_Tomas_Faculty_of_Engineering
notes         The University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Engineering, or UST-Engg, is the engineering school of the of Santo Tomas, the oldest and the largest Catholic university in Manila, Philippines.Established on May 18, 1907(University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Engineering: Thomasian Engineer Journal, pp 4-8. Thomasian Engineer Media, 2007), the faculty is the first engineering school in the Philippines. It is proclaimed as a Center of Excellence in and Communications Engineering and as a Center of Development in Engineering, Engineering, Engineering, Engineering and Engineering by the Commission on Higher Education.ObjectivesThe UST Faculty of Engineering holds a strong commitment to the pursuit of truth and to the formation of technically competent engineers imbued with Christian values. In line with this commitment, the Faculty pursues three objectives.First, the Faculty aims to enable the engineering student to achieve maximum professional competence which his aptitude and native intelligence will allow. The UST has spared no expense in procuring adequate instructional facilities as well as in selecting competent faculty staff in order to achieve this.Second, the Faculty seeks to develop in its students an incorruptible sense of professional ethics and the right social conscience based on a strong faith in God. In this direction, the Faculty is supported by curricula which extend beyond purely technical and engineering courses to include theology, values and ethics.Third, the Faculty strives to inculcate in its community interest in the natural arts, culture and heritage, and an active concern for the environment. This is manifest in the balanced curriculum content and in the wholesome atmosphere for extracurricular affairs that the Faculty and the University as a whole can speak of.History caption2   The Engineering-Architecture Building, now known as Roque Ruao Building, in 1950s.The Faculty of Engineering of the of Santo Tomas (UST) is the oldest engineering school in the Philippines. It was established on May 18, 1907, as School of Civil Engineering( with one program offering leading to the degree of Master of Science in Civil Engineering (MSCE). From faculty records, it appears that it was only in 1912 when the earliest batch of students were conferred their MSCE degrees. The institution was actually patterned after the of Havana in Cuba and was first set up at the second floor of the old UST building in Intramuros.(History of Civil Engineering in University of Santo Tomas) Taking into consideration the pioneering works of the teaching staff and students, the college got its first taste of prestige as the government, under President Manuel L. Quezon gave her recognition on July 12, 1921.(After the formation of the Engineerings Students Association in 1927, the first Engineering Student Council was organized the following year. In 1931, UST Engineering included Plane and Spherical Trigonometry on its curriculum.(The number of students enrolling in Civil Engineering decreased in 1934. So as to compensate this, another program was offered in the college, Mining Engineering. This new program was placed under the Mining Department which was headed by Lawson. On the same year, a famous Dominican engineering alumnus, Maurico Andres, CE, became the provincial superior and vice grand chancellor of Dominicans in the Philippines. The college also introduced courses in Chemical Engineering, which were first placed under the Chemical Department of the College of Liberal Arts.(With the addition of the other engineering disciplines, the School of Civil Engineering eventually became the Faculty of Engineering in 1939.( The Department of Mechanical Engineering was also established on that year. The University held classes up to 1941 but had to close when the Japanese turned it into a military camp during War II. Sadly, it was burned down on February 8, 1944. On January 7, 1946, the University reopened at its present site in Manila and the Faculty of Engineering was temporarily based in the UST Main Building. UST Engineering reopened with 300 students. Chemical Engineering accepted the first batch of women enrollees in the faculty. Electrical Engineering was offered on the same year to attract more students.(In 1948, Mining Engineering was phased out due to the decreasing number of students interested in mining.(Things started to look good as the Faculty was given a new separate home in February 1950. The four-story, E-shaped building known as the Roque Ruao Building, in honor of great civil engineer alumnus, Rev. Fr. Roque Ruao, O.P. (Batch 1912) whom is responsible for the construction of the UST Main Building. It housed not only the  Faculty but included the College of Architecture and Fine Arts which earlier was under the Faculty of Engineering. On the same year, the Faculty produced the first women engineer: Purita Sarandi, Carmelita Reyes and Josefina Lamban, who graduated Magna cum Laude.(From four-year course, in 1954, engineering course was extended to a five-year course to accommodate more subjects related to engineering. Electronics Engineering paved the way for a bachelors degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering in 1963. The Institute of Technological Courses became part of the Faculty in 1972. Industrial Engineering is integrated into the college in 1977, with Dean Francisco G. Reyes as head. In 1979, the Engineering Sciences division that houses first and second year engineering students is formed to offer basic engineering-related subjects.(In 2003, College of Architecture and College of Fine Arts and Design vacated the Roque Ruao Building, and replaced by Department of Information and Computer Studies.(Originally under the College of Science, Information and Computer Studies was formally integrated to the Faculty of Engineering in 2004 due to its technically-oriented character. Its inception in 1999 was due to the committee on Technology academic programs by the Academic Affairs, College of Science, Faculty of Engineering and College of Commerce and Business Administration. It was then decided to be placed under the College of Science as Institute of Computer Sciences. Along with the transition from Science, its department head Perla P. Cosme joined the Engineering Faculty. The current chair is Engr. Alex A. Santos.(Faculty of Engineering officials Administrators* Dean - Atty. Engr. Josefin S. de Alban, Jr.* Regent - Rev. Fr.

Ffrith
Ffrith is a small village in the community of Llanfynydd in Flintshire, north-east Wales. NameThe name Ffrith (the Welsh double f is pronounced simply as f) reflects a spelling and pronunciation particular to Flintshire: it is derived from a North Welsh word meaning variously a pasture, enclosure or forest and borrowed originally from the English word frith, meaning a forest or game preserve.(Owen, H. W. The place-names of east Flintshire, University of Wales Press, 1994, p.297) The name Belmont or Bell Mount was also commonly used for the village in the 19th century.(Owen, H. W. The place-names of east Flintshire, University of Wales Press, 1994, p.297) In local usage the village is usually referred to as the Ffrith.The village is situated in the southernmost part of the county in the wooded valley of the Cegidog at the point where the Nant-y-Ffrith stream flows into it. Neighbouring villages include Cymau to the east, Brymbo to the south-east and Llanfynydd, one mile to the north. The nearest major towns are Wrexham to the south-east and Mold towards the north-west.Historyexcavations have revealed evidence of Roman presence in the area. A villa was built here, a road is thought to have passed through and lead mining may have taken place. Several centuries later, Dyke was constructed across the area.(Ffrith, Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust) Team led a dig in the area, digging in the car park of the Blue Bell pub as well as other areas of the village. (http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2006_ffrith_found.html, Time Team: What they Found)In the 19th century, the villages size and importance grew as quarrying for limestone and silica and mining for lead and fireclay became more significant. A railway line, the Wrexham and Minera Joint Railway was built through the village and a small station, a number of shops and several pubs opened. Industry in the area declined through the 20th century, with the last fireclay level closing in the late 1960s. The railway ceased operation in 1952 (a large stone viaduct still stands near the village) and the village shops have now closed, and one of the two pubs (the Blue Bell) remains open. The second, the Poachers Cottage closed in mid 2009 and was the subject of a fire in mid 2010. (http://www.leaderlive.co.uk/news/90367/arson-fear-as-fire-damages-historic-wrexham-pub.aspx, Wrexham Evening Leader) There is a rare example of a bridge dating from at least the 18th century, and possibly older, in the village.(Ffrith, Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust)groundsel, a plant found almost entirely in Wales, was first discovered near Ffrith in 1948.References* Smuts, Bill, Jenner, Lorna & Sheerin, Nic (2006) Llanfynydd: a photographic journal, Delmar Press.

Ishmael_Beah
 website  Ishmael Beah (born on November 23, 1980 in Jong, District, Leone(UNICEF, Youth leadership profiles, . Retrieved February 15, 2007.)) is a former Leonean soldier and the author of the published memoir, Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier.Early yearsIn 1991  a vicious civil war overtook Leone, the country in which he was living. At the age of 13, he was forced to become a child soldier. According to Beahs account, he fought for almost three years before being rescued by UNICEF.( Beah fought both during the war and after its conclusion. In 1997, he fled Freetown due to the increasing violence and found his way to York City, where he lived with Laura Simms, his foster mother. In New York City, Beah attended the Nations International School. After high school, he enrolled at College and graduated in 2004 with a degree in Politics.(During his time in the Sierra Leonean government army, Beah says he killed too many people to count. He and other soldiers smoked marijuana and sniffed amphetamines and brown-brown, a mix of cocaine and gunpowder. He blames the addictions and the brainwashing for his violence( and cites them and the pressures of the army as reasons for his inability to escape on his own:  If you left, it was as good as being dead.( During a February 14, 2007 appearance on Daily Show, Beah said that he believed that returning to civilized society was more difficult than the act of becoming a child soldier, saying that dehumanizing children is a relatively easy task.(The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, February 14, 2007 http://www.google.com/url?sat&ctres&cd1&urlhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.comedycentral.com%2Fmotherload%2F%3Fml_video%3D82274&eiyTEeR776KqSAigHXn8ifAg&usgAFQjCNEvZbnPC9C4UkyFOZZ7cHRZaRvwZw&sig2-eTceXgFCYk5oNUf9z7Mew.) Rescued in 1996 by a coalition of UNICEF and NGOs, he found the transition difficult. He and his fellow child soldiers fought frequently. He credits one volunteer, Nurse Esther, with having the patience and compassion required to bring him through the difficult period. She recognized his interest in American rap music and reggae since he was a kid, gave him a Walkman and a Marley cassette, and employed music as his bridge to his past, prior to the violence. Slowly, he accepted her assurances that  its not your fault.()Living in Freetown with an uncle, he went to school and was invited to speak in 1996 at the UN in New York. When Freetown was overrun by the joined forces of the rebels (RUF or Revolutionary United Front) and Army of Sierra Leone in 1997 (the Army of Sierra Leone was originally fighting against the RUF), he contacted Laura Simms, whom he had met the year before, and made his way to the United States.(If I choose to feel guilty for what I have done, I will want to be dead myself, Beah said. I live knowing that I have been given a second life, and I just try to have fun, and be happy and live it the best I can.(Alissa Swango, NYC24, the University Graduate School of Journalism, A Child Soldier Grows Up, 2006. Retrieved February 15, 2007.)Life in the United StatesWhile at college in Oberlin, Beah pursued advocacy work against the abuse of children during wartime. He spoke at the UN and met with leaders including Clinton and Mandela.(Beah currently works for the Rights Watch Childrens Division Advisory Committee,(James Pitkin, Week, Ishmael Beah&mdash;An ex-child soldiers trip from Sierra Leones war to a Starbucks bookshelf., February 14, 2007. Retrieved February 15, 2007.) lives in Brooklyn, and is considering attending graduate school.(He has served as the keynote speaker for several events, including the Young Leaders Conference 2007 (July 1526 session), Oberlin Colleges 175th convocation ceremony, and the 2008 College Conference in North Carolina.The 29-year-old recently traveled home to Sierra Leone with an News camera, a return that he describes as bittersweet.  It became a kind of bloodlust and madness, to the point that we emulated the leaders, he said. When the lieutenant or corporal caught a prisoner and slit their throat or something like that, all the young people talked about it and say we want to do that, we want to be like that.(Child Soldiers Long Way Home -- ABC News)Awards and recognitionA Long Way Gone was nominated for a Quill Award in the Best Debut Author category for 2007.Time magazines Lev Grossman named it one of the Top 10 Nonfiction Books of 2007, ranking it at #3, and praising it as painfully sharp, and its ability to take takes readers behind the dead eyes of the child-soldier in a way no other writer has.(Poniewozik, James;  Top 10 Nonfiction Books; time.com) He was last seen at the Book Fair International presenting this book.Credibility disputeIn 2008,  Australian reported that aspects of Beahs account of his life story did not match other evidence. The report claimed that Beahs village was destroyed in 1995 rather than 1993, and that given the more compressed time frame, he could not have been a soldier for more than a couple of months, rather than the years that he describes in his book.(Twist in the tale of a child soldier | The Australian) He would also have been aged 15 when he became a soldier, rather than 13. Questions were also raised about Beahs description of a battle between child soldiers at a UNICEF camp, in which 6 people were said to have been killed. Witnesses interviewed by The Australian said that such an event in a UNICEF camp would have drawn significant attention in Sierre Leone, but no independent verification of such a battle could be obtained. Investigations by other publications also failed to discover other evidence of such a battle, and UNICEF, while supportive of Beah in general, also said that it had not been able to verify this aspect of his story.(village voice > blogs > Runnin Scared > UNICEF Cannot Confirm Beahs Camp Brawl Claim) The Australians claims were subsequently denied in a statement issued by Beah, in which he called into question the reliability of the sources quoted. The statement also cited the fact that during the early stages of its research, the newspaper had investigated the possibility that Beahs father was still alive, a possibility that was based on mistaken identity by an Australian mining engineer. The Australians published articles stated that they had established that the man in question was not Beahs father. Beahs adoptive mother also reaffirmed her belief in the validity of the dates, quoting two Sierra Leonean sources who corroborated the chronology of events given in his book.(Ishmael Beah Takes Public Stand - 1/21/2008 - Publishers Weekly) However, the publisher amended this statement after The Australian objected that it seriously misrepresented the newspapers report. The source cited by the publisher, Mr. Leslie Mboka, National Chairman of the Campaign for Just Mining, was in fact quoted by The Australian. The newspaper quoted him as saying that Beah was a young child who had been through terrible things so he could easily have got things mixed up.  Mr. Mboka, when subsequently contacted by the publisher, reported to them that he had vigorously supported Beahs chronology when interviewed by The Australian, and had challenged the paper for bias. However, Mr. Mboka had not met Beah until after the disputed events had taken place, and so was unable to provide firsthand verification of his account.(village voice > news > Boy Soldier of Fortune by Graham Rayman) The other correction involved the newspapers publication, not of Beahs foster-mothers address but of her publicly listed website address; hate mail had indeed been received, but via the Internet.  While the publisher made note of these, it stood by the accuracy of the book.(The Book Standard is closed)The dispute over Beahs credibility arose at a time when the exposure of some fictional memoirs, such as Seltzers account of growing up in a Los Angeles crime gang(Gang Memoir, Turning Page, Is Pure Fiction - New York Times) and James Freys account of drug addiction had led to debate over the nature of the genre. The controversy was followed up in international publications including the British Times,(Bryan Appleyards full account of his interview with Ishmael Beah - Times Online) Slate,(The feud over Ishmael Beahs child-soldier memoir, A Long Way Gone. - By Gabriel Sherman - Slate Magazine) and the Voice.(village voice > news > Boy Soldier of Fortune by Graham Rayman) Beah had claimed to have a photographic memory which enabled him to have perfect recall of the events he described, leaving him less room to maneuver than if he allowed room for human error.(village voice > news > Boy Soldier of Fortune by Graham Rayman) However, some of his defenders as well as his critics allowed for the possibility that his account was not entirely accurate, stating that the main point was that he had drawn attention to an issue that was of vital importance. Possible explanations for any inaccuracies include the trauma of war as experienced by a young child, the drug use described in his account, and the possibility that Beah was tacitly encouraged by outsiders to compile stories from multiple sources into a singular autobiographical account. Boothby, an academic who has undertaken extensive research into children and war, said that while all of the atrocities described by Beah have occurred at various points, it would be highly unusual for one child to have experienced them all. Boothby criticised the mentality that provided attention only to those with the most horrific stories to tell, thus encouraging exaggeration. Ive seen it over and over. Whether by psychologists or journalists, they are encouraged to tell the sensational stories...The system is set up to reward sensational stories. We all need to look at why does something have to be so horrific before we open our eyes and ears and hearts?(village voice > news > Boy Soldier of Fortune by Graham Rayman)Beah has made a vigorous response to the charges leveled against him in The Australian.  A press statement refuting these allegations may be found at http://www.alongwaygone.com/Ishmael_Beah_statement.pdfCriticism from Sierra LeoneIn a critical investigative research by a local Sierra Leonean journalist, Muctaru Wurie; a lengthy report which was published by Sierra Leone leading magazine, SierraEye, Sierra Express Newspaper, Concord Times, All Africa.com, http://allafrica.com/stories/200907140962.html and Kalleone newspaper. Muctaru Wurie took a critical look at the book citing various instances in the book that he cited as false or events that never occurred http://oneminutebookreviews.wordpress.com/2009/07/16/ishmael-beah%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98a-long-way-gone%E2%80%99-is-%E2%80%98a-long-way-from-the-truth-sierra-leonean-magazine-says-in-a-report-that-raises-%E2%80%98serious-doubts%E2%80%99-about-its-story/. The Sierra Leonean book critic who has also reviewed works of other Sierra Leonean writers such as Aminatta Forna and Mariatu Kamara http://muctaruwurie.wordpress.com/tag/the-memory-of-love/ took a suspicious approach and interviewed several Sierra Leoneans and humanitarian workers including former Information Minister and head of the dissident radio station (FM 98.1), Dr Julius Spencer that was mentioned in Ishmaels book. Other prominent Sierra Leoneans interviewed are Isaac Massaqoi, Head of Mass Communications Department, Fourah Bay College, a long practising surgeon, Dr Kamara and many others. Some of the critical points Wurie raised in his article are Ishmael claims of being forcefully conscripted by the military. Some Sierra Leonean military personnel, local businessmen and Sierra Leonean Truth and Reconciliation Commission experts questioned the claims by Beah that he was captured and conscripted by the military at Yele. Ishmaels timing of when his village was actually attacked also came under a huge question mark. There are also other various events that Muctaru Wurie pointed out were totally wrong or never occurred, such as the announcement of a coup detat, which witness tells Wurie was actually announced by Corporal Gborie, instead of Major Johnny Paul Koroma as Ishmael claimed. The slaughter of a whole family by rebels in the city was also an event which witnesses said never happened. Ishmael Beah says that when he left Sierra Leone for Guinea after being removed from the fighting: The immigration officers were asking for three hundred Leones, almost two months pay, to put a departure stamp on passports. Muctaru Wurie stated: The fact is that the average monthly salary was far above that. Le 300 could only get you a pint of soft drink by the time. In fact, a US dollar is exchanged for around Le 800. The journalist who spoke to many sources claimed he tried in vain to contact Ishmael through his publishers, and said if he had gotten that opportunity he would have asked serious questions. According to a report from a local Sierra Leone radio station, journalist Muctaru Wurie who alongside SierraEye Magazine has received threats since the article was published, reportedly told a local radio, Radio Democracy FM 98.1 in Freetown that he is now investigating Ishmaels actual root in Sierra Leone. He said his main intention was to look at the path of Ishmael from his alleged travels from his village from Mogbwemo to Freetown. Asked why he was doing this Muctaru said that instances Ishmael brought up in his book are very doubtful, including his inability to clearly mentioned in the book the exact address where he lived when he was in Freetown and also the mysterious rehab home that Ishmael mentioned in his book. Asked whether he was being biased, Muctaru said that Ishmael was to blame for the whole controversy and that had he been very clear and honest in the book, there wouldnt have been all this need for enquiry.See also*W.

A Liberal politician, and leader of the ALAS-Team Colombia political movement, he was arrested and jailed in 2007 for participating in parapolitics. Prior to serving in the Senate, he was also a Member of the of Representatives of Colombia from 1994 to 2001.()CareerAfter graduating as Economist from the Externado University in Bogot, 27-year old Arajo ran for the Chamber of Representatives, representing the Liberal Party and was elected. Two years later, along with his father, he founded a dissident political movement called for Social Advance (ALAS). After his second term in the Chamber, he ran for the Senate receiving more than half of his votes from the department of Cesar and Bogot, where he got the highest vote for someone from the Region. His movement supported Uribe for the Presidency of Colombia.(thumb|left|200px|Flyer of lvaro Arajo for the senate.The voter turnout in the Cesar raised suspicion, because of the influence of paramilitary forces in the area. In May 2005, Semana published an article revealing a possible plan by paramilitary forces to influence elections. The Department of Cesar was divided into two zones, the G-8, formed by 8 municipalities in central Cesar Department where revenues from mining industry are high, and in which Senator Mauricio Pimiento and Representative Jorge Enrique Ramrez got most of their votes, and the G-11, formed mostly by southern municipalities where Representative Miguel Duran Gelvis and Senator Arajo had a high turnout.()  Arajo responded to these accusations by citing years of hard work politics and his familys influence in the region. He also pointed out that results, like the ones in Tamalameque where he received more than 70% of the total votes, were easily explained because of the influence of his third runner-up, Ricardo Chajn Florin, who had been Mayor of Tamalameque.()In the Senate, Arajo was a member of the Fifth Commission of the Senate in which he promoted Hydrocarbon projects and proposed the Mines Code which is cited for duplicating the production of coal in Colombia. He was also a proponent of equal ownership rights for gay couples,() and integrating demobilized members of the Nutibara Bloc into the Armed Forces of Colombia if they met certain judicial requisites.He was temporarily replaced in the Senate from 17 August 2004 to 17 February 2005 by Ricardo Chajn Florin, the third-runner up in his list.(Parapolitica scandalOn January 19, 2006 Arajo was first accused by then candidate for Senate Petro, of having ties with paramilitary groups headed by the now demobilized paramilitary leader 40 and his men.() The Court of Colombia investigated the accusations in what became known as the Parapolitics scandal, as a result, on 16 February 2007, Arajo was arrested along with other senators for having ties to illegal paramilitary groups.()Accomplice in kidnappingArising from his investigation in parapolitics, Arajo was also formally accused of the kidnapping and extortion of former of Valledupar, Elas Ochoa Dazas brother Vctor.() He was found guilty of the charges and sentenced to 9 years and 3 months of prison on March 18, 2010.()Familylvaro was born on 7 November 1967 to Arajo Noguera and Mara Lourdes Castro, and he is married to Sandra Estevao.

John_Wilson_(18371915)
John Wilson (1837 &ndash; 24 March 1915) was an English coal miner, trade unionist, and a of Parliament (MP) for more than 25 years. Early life Born at Greatham, near Hartlepool, his mother Hannah died when he was four.  After his father, Christopher (b. 1807 at Greatham), died of cholera when Wilson was ten, he worked in the mines, spent four years as a merchant seaman, and return to Durham as a miner in 1860. Married in 1832 to Margaret (ne Firth), the couple emigrated to the United States in 1864, where Wilson worked the mines in Pennsylvania and Illinois.  They returned to Durham in 1867; the first two of their five children had been born in America.Wilson was one of the founders in 1869 of the Miners Association (DMA), which led to him being denied employment, but in 1878 he became a fulltime union organiser, rising to become the DMAs secretary in 1896. Political career The Act 1867 had extended the vote to working-class men in urban areas, allowing the election in 1874 of Burt and Alexander Macdonald as LiberalLabour Members of Parliament (MPs).The of the People Act 1884 extended the same qualifications to the constituencies, enfranchising many miners for the first time.  Wilson was elected at the 1885 general election as LiberalLabour MP for the new Houghton-le-Spring constituency, but lost his seat when the Liberal Party split at the 1886 general election over Irish Home Rule.He returned to House of Commons in 1890, at a by-election for the Mid Durham constituency following the death of William Crawford, a Liberal-Labour MP who was also Secretary of the Durham Miners Association.In Parliament, Wilson impressed as an effective speaker.  However, he followed a different political path to many of his mining colleagues.  The LiberalLabour movement had consisted of local electoral pacts between trades unions and the Liberal Party, whereby trade union-sponsored MPs (who received no salary) were politically allied to the Liberal Party, but the movement declined after 1885. The formation in 1893 of the resolutely socialist Labour Party was followed in 1900 by the Labour Representation Committee, which in 1906 changed its name to the Labour Party. The Labour movement no longer depended on the Liberal Party, and the alliance was effectively over when the MPs sponsored by the Federation of Great Britain joined the Labour Party after the January 1910 general election.However, Wilson did not join the Labour Party.  A methodist, he was a Liberal by conviction rather than by convenience, an admirer of Gladstone who believed in trade when much of the rest of the Labour movement was following a socialist path.

Mechanical_screening
Mechanical screening, often just called screening, is the practice of taking granulated ore material and separating it into multiple grades by particle size.This practice occurs in a variety of industries such as mining and mineral processing, agriculture, pharmaceutical, food, plastics, and recycling.(http://www.rotex.com/02applications/applications.aspx)General categoriesScreening falls under two general categories: dry screening and wet screening.  From these categories, screening separates a flow of material into grades, these grades are then either further processed to an intermediary product or a finished product. Additionally the machines can be categorised into moving screen and static screen machines, as well as by whether the screens are horizontal or inclined.ApplicationsThe mining and mineral processing industry uses screening for a variety of processing applications.  For example, after mining the minerals, the material is transported to a primary crusher.  Before crushing large boulder are scalped on a shaker with  thick shielding screening.  Further down stream after crushing the material can pass through screens with openings or slots that continue to become smaller.  Finally, screening is used to make a final separation to produce salable product based on a grade or a size range.ProcessA screening machine consist of a drive that induces vibration, a screen cloth that causes particle separation, and a deck which holds the screen cloth and the drive and is the mode of transport for the vibration.There are physical factors that makes screening practical.  For example, vibration, g force, bed density, and material shape all facilitate the rate or cut.  forces can also hinder screening efficiency in way of water attraction causing sticking or plugging, or very dry material generate a charge that causes it to attract to the screen itself.As with any industrial process there is a group of terms that identify and define what screening is.  Terms like blinding, contamination, frequency, amplitude, and others describe the basic characteristics of screening, and those characteristics in turn shape the overall method of dry or wet screening.In addition, the way a deck is vibrated differentiates screens.  Different types of motion have their advantages and disadvantages.  In addition cloth types also have their different properties that lead to advantages and disadvantages.Finally, there are issues and problems associated with screening.  Screen tearing, contamination, blinding, and dampening all affect screening efficiency.Physical principles*Vibration - either sinusoidal vibration or gyratory vibration.**Sinusoidal Vibration occurs at an angled plane relative to the horizontal.  The vibration is in a wave pattern determined by frequency and amplitude.**Gyratory Vibration occurs at near level plane at low angles in a reciprocating side to side motion.*Gravity - This physical interaction is after material is thrown from the screen causing it to fall to a lower level.  Gravity also pulls the particles through the screen cloth.*Density - The density of the material relates to material stratification.*Electrostatic Force -  This force applies to screening when particles are extremely dry or is wet.Screening terminologyLike any mechanical and physical entity there are scientific, industrial, and layman terminology.  The following is a partial list of terms that are associated with mechanical screening.*Amplitude - This is a measurement of the screen cloth as it vertically peaks to its tallest height and troughs to its lowest point.  Measured in multiples of the acceleration constant g (g-force).*Acceleration - Applied Acceleration to the screen mesh in order to overcome the van der waal forces*Blinding - When material plugs into the open slots of the screen cloth and inhibits overflowing material from falling through.(Woven Wire Mesh Glossary of Terms)*Brushing - This procedure is performed by an operator who uses a brush to brush over the screen cloth to dislodged blinded opening.*Cloth, screening cloth - it is the material defined by mesh size, which can be made of any type of material such steel, stainless steel, rubber compounds, brass, etc.(Woven wire)*Contamination -  This is unwanted material in a given grade.  This occurs when there is oversize or fine size material relative to the cut or grade. Another type of contamination is foreign body contamination.**Oversize contamination occurs when there is a hole in the screen such that the hole is larger than the mesh size of the screen.  Other instances where oversize occurs is material overflow falling into the grade from overhead, or there is the wrong mesh size screen in place.**Fines contamination is when large sections of the screen cloth is blinded over, and material flowing over the screen does not fall through.  The fines are then retained in the grade.**Foreign body contamination is unwanted material that differs from the virgin material going over and through the screen.  It can be anything ranging from tree twigs, grass, metal slag to other mineral types and composition.  This contamination occurs when there is a hole in the scalping screen or a foreign materials mineralogy or chemical composition differs from the virgin material.*Deck - a deck is frame or apparatus that holds the screen cloth in place.  It also contains the screening drive.  It can contain multiple sections as the material travels from the feed end to the discharge end.  Multiple decks are screen decks placed in a configuration where there are a series of decks attached vertically and lean at the same angle as it preceding and exceeding decks.  Multiple decks are often referred to as single deck, double deck, triple deck, etc.*Frequency - Measured in hertz (Hz) or revolutions per minute (RPM).  Frequency is the number of times the screen cloth sinusoidally peaks and troughs within a second.  As for a gyratory screening motion it is the number of revolutions the screens or screen deck takes in a time interval, such as revolution per minute (RPM).*Gradation, grading - Also called cut or cutting.  Given a feed material in an initial state, the material can be defined to a have a particle size distribution.  Grading is removing the maximum size material and minimum size material by way of mesh selection.(Soil Gradation)*Shaker - A generic term that refers to the whole assembly of any type mechanical screening machine.*Stratification -  This phenomenon occurs as vibration is passed through a bed of material.  This causes coarse (larger) material to rise and finer (smaller) material to descend within the bed.  The material in contact with screen cloth either falls through a slot or blinds the slot or contacts the cloth material and is thrown from the cloth to fall to the next lower level.(Screening)*Mesh -  Mesh refers to the number of open slots per linear inch.  Mesh is arranged in multiple configuration.  Mesh can be a square pattern, long-slotted rectangular pattern, circular pattern, or diamond pattern.(The Complete Wire Mesh Glossary of Terms)*Scalp, scalping - this is the very first cut of the incoming material with the sum of all its grades.  Scalping refers to removing the largest size particles.  This includes enormously large particles relative to the other particles sizes.  Scalping also cleans the incoming material from foreign body contamination such as twigs, trash, glass, or other unwanted oversize material.Types of mechanical screeningThere are generally three types of mechanical screening equipment that cause segregation. These types are based on the motion of the machine through its motor drive.*Circle-throw vibrating equipment -  This type of equipment has an eccentric shaft that causes the frame of the shaker to lurch at a given angle.  This lurching action literally throws the material forward and up.  As the machine returns to its base state the material falls by gravity to physically lower level. This type of screening is used also in mining operations for large material with sizes that range from six inches to +20 mesh.(WS Tyler  F-Class)*High frequency vibrating equipment -  This type of equipment drives the screen cloth only.  Unlike above the frame of the equipment is fixed and only the screen vibrates.  However, this equipment is similar to the above such that it still throws material off of it and allows the particles to cascade down the screen cloth. These screens are for sizes smaller than 1/8 of an inch to +150 mesh.(RHEWUM WA- The original)*Gyratory equipment -  This type of equipment differs from the above two such that the machine gyrates in a circular motion at a near level plane at low angles.  The drive is an eccentric gear box or eccentric weights.(Engelsmann Separators and Screeners)(Sweco - Vibratory Screener, Sifters, Separators, Round Screen, Vibratory Separator)Circle-throw vibrating equipmentCircle-throw vibrating equipment is a shaker or a series of shakers as to where the drive causes the whole structure to move.  The structure extends to a maximum throw or length and then contracts to a base state.  A pattern of springs are situated below the structure to where there is vibration and shock absorption as the structure returns to the base state.This type of equipment is used for very large particles, sizes that range from pebble size on up to boulder size material.  It is also designed for high volume output. As a scalper, this shaker will allow oversize material to pass over and fall into a crusher such a cone crusher, jaw crusher, or hammer mill.  The material that passes the screen by-passes the crusher and is conveyed and combined with the crush material.Also this equipment is used in washing processes, as material passes under spray bars, finer material and foreign material is washed through the screen.  This is one example of wet screening.High frequency vibrating equipmentHigh frequency vibrating equipment is a shaker whose frame is fixed and the drive vibrates only the screen cloth.  High frequency vibration equipment is for particles that are in this particle size range of an 1/8 in (3 mm) down to a +150 mesh.These shakers usually make a secondary cut for further processing or make a finished product cut.These shakers are usually set at a steep angle relative to the horizontal level plane.  Angles range from 25 to 45 degrees relative to the horizontal level plane.Gyratory equipmentThis type of equipment has an eccentric drive or weights that causes the shaker to travel in an orbital path.  The material rolls over the screen and falls with the induction of gravity and directional shifts.  Rubber balls and trays provide an additional mechanical means to cause the material to fall through.  The balls also provide a throwing action for the material to find an open slot to fall through.The shaker is set a shallow angle relative to the horizontal level plane.  Usually, no more than 2 to 5 degrees relative to the horizontal level plane.These types of shakers are used for very clean cuts.  Generally, a final material cut will not contain any oversize or any fines contamination.These shakers are designed for the highest attainable quality at the cost of a reduced feed rate.Referencesde:Siebmaschineru:uk:

Riondel,_British_Columbia
footnotes                Riondel is a village of approximately 400 people. It is situated on the eastern shore of Lake, located 90-minutes from British Columbia, using the worlds longest free ferry ride. History The settlement of Riondel originated from a very productive silver, lead and zinc mine, known as the mine. In 1882 an American named Sproule staked four claims along the Riondel Peninsula, including the Bluebell mine. When he left to register his claims an Englishman, Hammill, restaked the claims.  This led to a dispute that ended with Sproule shooting Hammill dead and Sproule Dying in the gallows for his crime. 1890s In the 1890s the settlement was known as Hendryx, after Hendryx, who had control of the Bluebell mine and other claims in the mid 1880s. In 1905 The Canadian Metal Company purchased the mine, and in 1907 the settlement was named Riondel after Edouard Riondel, the president of the Canadian Metal Company. Pronunciation Riondel is pronounced in several different ways, even by locals: RI,ON DEL, RYE-on-del,are all commonly heard. However, S.S. Fowler, who applied for the post office in 1907, wrote: It is or should be pronounced RI-ON-DEL with accent very slightly on the first syllable. Bluebell mine The Bluebell mine operated from 1895 to 1929, during which the population of Riondel was stable at around 70 people. With the closure of the Bluebell mine in 1929 the population dwindled until in 1943 there were only 22 people left in Riondel. In 1950 the Bluebell mine re-opened, and the population of Riondel soared to almost 300 people within three years. The expansion of the Bluebell mine required more electricity and in 1952 Cominco built power lines across the Kootenay Lake, to bring power to the East Shore without the use of generators. Development included a smelter and a townsite. This mine has the longest history in the province of Columbia. 1950-1972 From 1950, Riondel was a bustling, thriving mining town until 1972, when the Bluebell mine closed for good. Most people moved on to other nearby towns, while the older employees stayed in Riondel and retired. Riondel became a popular retirement community and at one time had more seniors per capita than any other code in Canada. 1972-Present Today Riondel is a tidy village with streets, a lakeside campground, beach, community centre, playground, cable TV system, 9-hole golf course, grocery and liquor store, cafe, pub,and in April, 2006 Riondel was connected with high-speed internet provided by Telus. Currently about 400 people live in the village. Riondel Daze On August 3 to 5, Riondel hosts an annual celebration called Riondel Daze. This event is usually attended by the Historical Society of Riondels vintage ambulance, a 1949 Mercury. The event features a ball tournament with a hot dog stand and local music. Location Riondel is located on Riondel Road on the eastern shore of Kootenay Lake, 6 miles (10 km) north of Kootenay Bay, the eastern terminal of the Kootenay Lake ferry. Riondel is a 1-hour drive from British Columbia, and a 90-minute drive from British Columbia, using the worlds longest free ferry ride. Hiking The Waterfront Trail in Riondel follows 1.5 km of the lakeshore from the south end of North Bay beach; The Pebble Beach Trail 7 km north of Riondel leads from the Kootenay Lake East FS Road to a south-facing, pebbled beach; The 15-minute Pilot Bay Lighthouse Trail near Kootenay Bay leads to an historic 1907 lighthouse; The one-hour Pilot Bay Marine Park trail leads through varying terrain as it follows the lakeshore; The Plaid Lake Hiking Trail near Crawford Bay is a full day hike to the alpine Plaid Lake on the west side of the Purcell Mountains; The Duck Lakes Dykes Trail near Sirdar offers miles of almost level hiking through some of the richest waterfowl habitat in Columbia. Golf Golfers in Riondel have two golf clubs to choose from; the 9-hole Par 3 course at the friendly Riondel Golf Club, located on Galena Bay Wharf Road just 10 minutes from the Bay ferry, and the 18-hole championship Kokanee Springs Golf Resort in Crawford Bay, a 20-minute drive to the south. Fishing Kootenay Lake maintains considerable populations of various fish species, including kokanee, rainbow and trout, Varden, burbot, and whitefish. Kootenay Lake supports record-sized Trout, and the worlds largest recorded kokanee - almost 10 pounds (4.5 kg) - was taken from Kootenay Lake. Kokanee means red fish in the Kootenay Indian language and is the name given to the land-locked salmon that spawn in large numbers in Creek in the late summer. The best fishing time is in the fall and winter months. Recreation Other outdoor opportunities in Riondel include canoeing or kayaking the waters of the 75-mile long and 5-mile wide Kootenay Lake (rentals available), swimming, wildlife and nature viewing, boating and sailing, horsedrawn adventures, and backcountry exploration. The Youth Of Riondel Have a youth Group at the Riondel Recreation Center playing floor hockey on Sundays and many other things such as pool air hockey and movies. there is a playground at the recreation center (White Building) which was a old school and now is a community center library,museum,aa meeting room and moms and tots,computer room. Camping The private Riondel Campground is located 1 km from the Riondel General Store, and a second campground and park is located 12 km north of Riondel.References(*Community of Riondel*Kootenay Lake Region*British Columbia Further reading * Bluebell Memories by A.Terry Turner* A Recollection of Moments: Riondel 1907-2007 by Wendy M E Scott

Kanawha_(1899)
Kanawha was a 471-ton steam-powered luxury yacht initially built in 1899 for millionaire industrialist and financier Henry Huttleston Rogers (18401909). One of the key men in the Oil Trust, Rogers was one of the last of the robber barons of the Age in the States. He was also a secret philanthropist.Rogers was a major developer of coal and railroad properties in Virginia along the River. Aboard the Kanawha, he frequently hosted his friends, including American humorist Twain and black educator T. Washington.After Rogers death in 1909, the Kanawha served the U.S. Navy during War I. After the war, it was sold to Garveys ill-fated Star Line and renamed the S.S. Antonio Maceo. However, the former luxury yacht was apparently in poor condition by this time. It blew a boiler and killed a man off the Virginia coast on its first voyage from New York to Cuba.BuilderConsolidated Shipbuilding was a builder of luxury yachts. The Kanawha was built in 1899 at the shipyard on Matthewson Road, in the Morris Heights section of Bronx, York City. The shipyard moved after War II. The former shipyard property became part of Clemente State Park.(http://www.coltoncompany.com/shipbldg/ussbldrs/prewwii/shipyards/atlantic/consolidated.htm)The 471-ton Kanawha was approximately  long. Manned by a crew of 39 people, Kanawha was often compared by the newspapers of the day to the North Star, the yacht of a member of the family. Even among its contemporaries in the fleet of the York Yacht Club, Kanawha was a large vessel, noted for her exceptional speed.Source of original nameThe name Kanawha was probably selected by the original owner, Henry Huttleston Rogers. Among his many other activities, Rogers was an active investor and developer of West Virginias coal lands and railroads in the area of the River in the late 19th and early 20th century.The latter included the and Pocahontas Railroad Company incorporated in 1898. Its line ran  from the Kanawha River up a tributary called Paint Creek. Rogers negotiated its lease to the and Ohio Railway (C&O) in 1901 and its sale to a newly formed C&O subsidiary, and Paint Creek Railway Company, in 1902.That same year, Rogers began investing with William Nelson Page in the Railway, which was built south into new coal lands from Deepwater in Fayette County on the Kanawha River.Henry Huttleston RogersHenry Huttleston Rogers (18401909) was a self-made man from Massachusetts, a fishing village just over the bridge from the great whaling port, New Bedford. Fairhaven borders the River to the west and Bay to the south.In the mid 1850s, whaling was already an industry in decline in England. Competition from Scandinavian water men, and the emergence of petroleum and later gas as a replacement fuel for lighting in the second half of the 19th century, caused a much further decline. Henry Rogers father was one of the many men of New England who changed from a life on the sea to other work to provide for their families. However, the emergence of the industry was to become the initial source of success for Henry Rogers.Hen Rogers, as his friends knew him, had married his childhood sweetheart, Abbie Palmer Gifford, the daughter of a retired ship captain, and gone to work in the newly-discovered oil fields of western Pennsylvania. After several years of living in a shack at McClintocksville (near Oil City), and operating the small Oil Refinery with a partner, Rogers had come to the attention of Pratt, an early pioneer of the emerging petroleum industry in the United States. Abbie and Henry Rogers and their young daughter Anne moved to the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, York, where he worked in Pratts kerosene refinery Oil Works. Pratts product later gave rise to the slogan, The holy lamps of Tibet are primed with Astral Oil.Henry Rogers often slept on the floor of the Brooklyn refinery between work shifts, with Abbie bringing his meals to him there. While working for Pratt at Greenpoint, Rogers invented an improved way of separating naphtha (a light oil similar to kerosene) from crude oil. He was granted U.S. Patent #120,539 on October 31, 1871.(U.S. Patent # 120,539) Rogers became Pratts protg and was made a partner in the newly-formed Pratt and Company.By the mid-1870s, as his family eventually grew to 5 children, Rogers crafted a deal for with D. Rockefeller for Pratt principals to join his enterprises. Charles Pratt retired soon thereafter and founded Institute, and his son, Millard Pratt, became Secretary of Oil. Rogers was quite a bit younger than his early mentor, and soon thrived within Rockefellers organization, rising in the years thereafter to become a principal and a Vice President of the Oil Trust by 1890.Even after he was well-off financially, Henry Rogers continued to be what was many year later termed a workaholic. He was an active developer of all types of natural resources and transportation enterprises. Soon, he had investments of his own own in natural gas, copper, steel, coal, and railroad industries. By 1899, he had already become one of the richest men in the United States.Rogers new yachtAt the time he had the Kanawha built, Henry Rogers was known widely in the media as simply H.H. Rogers. He was known publicly as one of the last of the robber barons of the Age, and was widely known by the nickname Hell Hound Rogers.Abbie had died suddenly in 1894. His children were now grown. Rogers subsequently married a divorce, Emelie Augusta Randel Hart, and they lived in a townhouse in New York City, and maintained a large 85-room summer home at Fairhaven. Rogers and his family had given various public buildings and infrastructure to their hometown, and they vacationed at Fairhaven frequently.Mark Twain and newspapersFor the last ten years of his life, the Kanawha became Rogers preferred mode of travel between Fairhaven and New York, as well as on cruises to Roads in Virginia. Among his personal friends were such diverse people as humorist Twain, leading black educator T. Washington, teacher Sullivan and her amazing deaf and blind pupil Keller, as well as Rockefeller and Carnegie. Rogers paid for Kellers education at College. Twain and Washington were frequent guests aboard the Kanawha.The newspapers, the leading media of the era, seemed to delight in attempting to monitor and report on the travels of the yacht, especially when Mark Twain was aboard. The archives of New York Times contain many published reports of their travels, which included at least one cruise together in 1902 north to the coast of Maine, Brunswick and Scotia.In April 1907, Rogers, Twain, and friends sailed to attend the opening day festivities of the Exposition held at Point in a rural section of County, Virginia. Twains public popularity was such that large numbers of citizens paid to ride touring boats out to where the Kanawha was anchored in Hampton Roads in hopes of getting a glimpse of him. As the gathering of boats around the yacht became a safety hazard, he finally obliged by coming on deck and waving to the crowds.(Mark Twain and Henry Huttleston Rogers in Virginia)When they were ready to depart the Norfolk area, due to poor weather conditions the steam yacht was delayed by its captain for several days from leaving the Hampton Roads area and venturing into the Ocean. Rogers and some of the others in his party (without Twain) returned to New York by railroad. Due to his dislike of traveling by rail, Twain elected to return aboard the Kanawha, despite the delay. However, the news media reporters lost track of Twains whereabouts; when he failed to return to New York City as scheduled, The New York Times speculated that he had been lost at sea.(Twain and Yacht Disappear)Upon arriving safely in New York and learning of this, to the relief (and likely delight) of his admiring public and no doubt to the great embarrassment of the journalists at the Times, the humorist issued essentially a replay of his famous The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated statement. (He had originally sent this message in 1897 by cable from London to the newspapers in the United States after his obituary had been mistakenly published.)(Twain investigating)This time, Twain said, in part, :...I will make an exhaustive investigation of this report that I have been lost at sea. If there is any foundation for the report, I will at once apprise the anxious public.Later that year, Mark Twain and Rogers son, Henry Jr. (Harry), returned to the Jamestown Exposition aboard the Kanawha. The departure from New York of the Kanawha, as well as that of Vanderbilts steam yacht, the North Star, which left at the same time, was dutifully reported by The New York Times. The humorist helped host Robert Fulton Day on September 23, 1907, celebrating the centennial of Fultons invention of the steamboat. Twain was filling in for ailing former U.S. President Cleveland, and introduced Rear Admiral F. Harrington.(Twain skipper of Rogers yacht)Secret philanthropyThe newspapers seemed less aware that on cruises aboard the Kanawha, Twain and Rogers were joined at frequent intervals by Dr. Washington. From all outward appearances, Washington was apparently just another friend. That part was mostly true, but there was more.Known but to a very few, through Booker T. Washington, Hell Hound Rogers was a secret philanthropist, encouraging the Negro educator and aiding in his educational efforts for Americans by deploying a new concept which came to be known as anonymous donor funds to contribute very large amounts of money in support of several teachers colleges (now University and University) and literally dozens of small schools in the South over the same 15-year period of the Twain-Rogers friendship.Dr. Washington only revealed this situation in June 1909 just weeks after Rogers death as he made a pre-planned tour along the Virginian Railway, traveling in Rogers private rail car Dixie.(The Booker T. Washington Papers, Vol.10, page 122, May 1909, U. of Illinois Press)Virginian Railway Beginning in 1902, Rogers was an investor in the modest Deepwater Railway. It was initially just a line railroad, much like several others in West Virginia Rogers had been involved with. Unlike the earlier enterprises, the Deepwater Railway did not find a buyer among the large railroads, and eventually grew to become the West Virginia portion of Rogers final lifes work, the coal-hauling Railway, completed in 1909, which extended  from the Kanawha River to piers at Point on Hampton Roads near Norfolk, Virginia.The VGN was planned and initially developed in secrecy right under the noses of some of Rogers contemporaries, notably Cassatt and William Vanderbilt, heads of the Railroad (PRR) and York Central Railroad (NYC) respectively. They had secretly entered into a community of interests pact to control the and Ohio Railway (C&O) and the and Western Railway (N&W) in the coal fields, and block all competitors.Ostensibly headed by coal mining manager William Nelson Page, with Rogers as a partner, the leaders of the big railroads were skeptical that Page could finance and complete his venture, which had issued no bonds, and sold no stock. The fact they didnt know was that the new $40 million dollar Virginian Railway was financed almost entirely from Rogers personal fortune. However, that situation was apparently the source of considerable stress to him after the Financial Panic of 1907 put an unexpected strain on his resources. In the summer of 1907, Rogers suffered a stroke, and took 5 months to recover. He regained his health, at least to most appearances. By mid-1908, he had made the necessary financial adjustments, and the construction on his railroad had resumed. The new Virginian Railways coal pier was at Sewells Point, right next door to the Jamestown Exposition site.The railroad had a final spike ceremony on January 29, 1909, which was also Henry Rogers 69th birthday. In April of that year, during a tour along the new railroad in his private railcar, Dixie, he was feted with celebrations by communities all along the new rail line, notably at Norfolk, Victoria, and Roanoke in Virginia, and at West Virginia.However, despite the celebrations of early 1909, Rogers was not destined to live to see his new railroad in full operation, scheduled for July 1.Death of Henry RogersRogers had been warned by his doctor and friends, notably John D. Rockefeller, to slow down his work pace. However, he found that difficult. In May 1909, spent a leisurely weekend at Fairhaven, and visited old friends. However, the following week, he was back at work at his office in the Standard Oil Building at 26 Broadway in Manhattan. On the morning of Wednesday, May 20, 1909, he awoke at his townhouse in New York City, and complained to his wife that he was feeling poorly. She immediately called for his doctor, but within the hour, he was dead from another stroke. Following an elaborate funeral in New York City, his body was transported by train to Massachusetts, and he was interred at Fairhaven that Saturday next to his beloved Abbie in Riverside Cemetery. He had outlived her by only one day short of 15 years.The master of the Kanawha would not be returning to the luxury yacht. Not much seems to be recorded about the fate of the Kanawha in the period immediately following the death of its original owner. Rogers only son, Henry Jr., had the familys large summer home in Fairhaven torn down soon thereafter. It also seems unlikely that adequate funds among the Rogers children and their families, or even the will to continue cruises of the Kanawha, survived the death of the Standard Oil magnate and founder of the Virginian Railway.World War IAccording to records of the U.S. Navy, after nearly two decades as a pleasure craft the Kanawha was acquired by the Navy in late April 1917 for use in War I. The Navy had earlier had another ship also named Kanawha, USS Kanawha (AO-1) &mdash; a fleet oiler built in 1914. To avoid potential confusion, the former Rogers yacht was commissioned by the Navy as USS Kanawha II (SP-130).Following brief service in the vicinity of New York City, in June 1917 Kanawha II became one of the early ships sent across the Atlantic Ocean to operate in European waters. For the rest of the War, and for some months after the November 1918 Armistice, the ex-yacht performed patrol and convoy escort missions off western France, making occasional contact with German submarines.In March 1918, Kanawha II was renamed USS Piqua, probably to avoid message confusion with the Navy oiler. In the summer of 1918, she was the flagship of the U.S. District Commander based at Lorient, France.Her European service ended in May 1919, when Piqua began a month-long voyage back to the United States. She was decommissioned and returned to her owner at the beginning of July 1919.(http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-p/sp130.htm)Black Star LineThe final chapter in the life of the Kanawha was as unusual as the way it had started. The Star Line was a shipping line incorporated by Garvey, who organized the Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). The Black Star Line derived its name from the Star Line, another shipping line whose success Garvey felt he could duplicate, which would become a standard of his movement.Unfortunately for Garvey and his efforts, the ships he purchased beginning in 1919 were apparently both overpriced and in poor condition. Among these was the once-grand and well-maintained Kanawha. It was noted that Dr. Washington, the late educator, had been an honored guest aboard the ship years earlier. Renamed by the Black Star Line the S.S. Antonio Maceo, after putting in for unplanned repairs at Norfolk, it blew a boiler and killed a man off the Virginia coast on its first voyage from New York to Cuba, and had to be towed back to New York. The Black Star Line stopped sailing in February 1922, and was soon out of business.References(

Ear_Falls,_Ontario
 footnotes            Ear Falls is a small settlement and township located in Ontario, Canada, on the right bank of the English River near the outlet of Seul. It is located along Highway 105,  north of Highway 17 and Vermilion Bay, about halfway between Highway 17 and Red Lake, or about  northwest of Bay.Ear Falls is entirely surrounded by Kenora District.EtymologyThere are different versions of how the settlement was named after the eponymous falls. The following are three versions of the story found in the museum archives:# Ear Falls was once known as Otahwaka Powitek to the Ojibwa people. This area was believed to be haunted by the spirit of a giant beaver which lived between the upper and lower falls. It was said that when the beaver was swimming, its ears could be seen rising and falling in the foaming water.# Legends have produced the names of many local spots, and one such name is Ear Falls. According to information provided by Gerald Bannatyne, a collector of artifacts, aboriginal people living on Goose Island were travelling past the rapids which are now known as Ear Falls, when they saw something that frightened them. They brought more men back with them to investigate. The monster turned out to be a large tree route stuck in the rocks. The spot became known as Big Ear, which later became Ear Falls.# Many, many years ago, local aboriginals had named Ear Falls Otahwaka Powitek because the water had worn the rock ledge at the lip of the falls roughly in the shape of a human ear.The early French fur traders name for the falls was Portage DOreille, or literally speaking, carrying place of the ear. Upper Ear Falls, about 1.5 miles upstream, was drowned out when the lake level was raised some  when the power dam came into operation, and nothing of it remains today except dangerous ripple rapids with a very strong current.HistoryFur trade (1680-1880)The beginning of the 17th century marked the arrival of French explorers to Northwestern Ontario and the beginning of the trade. The fur trade would remain the predominant business in the North for the next 200 years. The Bay Company and the West Company were rivals for most of the fur trade era. In 1821 both companies united, and posts were set up in the Ear Falls area on Lac Seul and Red Lake. Remains of these posts could be seen along the lakes in the area until the 1920s when the construction of the Lac Seul Dam caused a rise in the water levels and the remnants of the fur trade were covered with water.The arrival of the railway in the 1880s began the decline of the fur trade.  The Hudsons Bay Company shifted the focus of their posts to meet the needs of the new residents in the area: supplies for miners, lumbermen and settlers were sold at posts and stores in the Ear Falls area.The railway era (1880-1916)Following the construction of the Pacific Railway between 1870 and 1885, geologist and surveyors mapped Northwestern Ontario. By 1923, the National Railway was extended through the boundary of West Patricia with two lines: The Grand Trunk Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway. The railway opened the area to the development of timber, fish and mineral resources.Development of Ear Falls did not occur immediately with the arrival of the railways as the lines were not close to the town, but occurred when the fur trade was altered as a result of the railway. Supplies were brought in and furs were taken out at the closest point to the rail. Warehouses were erected for shipping and receiving at Hudson (near Lookout). A steamer was placed on Lac Seul to enhance freight operations.  Red Lake and Central Patricia gold developments (1925-present)The discovery of gold at Red Lake in 1925 initiated a rise in development throughout areas north of the railways. In the following years, thousands of claims were staked from Favorable Lake in the west to Lake in the east. Transportation routes, settlements and power supplies were developed to support the mining industry. It was the success of the gold mines which led to the shaping of the regions transportation, land use and settlements patterns. It was also the Red Lake Gold developments that provided incentive for settlers to locate to Ear Falls. The falls were located on the primary freight route from Hudson to Red Lake.A generating station was constructed by Hydro in order to supply power to the mines at Red Lake, which lead to the creation of the Hydro colony at Ear Falls. By the 1930s, Ear Falls had replaced Goldpines as the main settlement in the area. When bush planes became more affordable to transport goods, Ear Falls became the jump off point to Red Lake. Hydro power developmentDuring the 1920s, the Federal Government considered proposals to regulate the water in the River. By constructing the dam at the head of Lac Seul, the lake would become a large reservoir, retaining the spring run-off for use by power developments downstream on both the English and Winnipeg River systems. Lower Ear Falls was the selected location for the Lac Seul dam.The construction of the dam at Ear Falls began in the spring of 1928, but not before camp buildings were constructed along the east side of the river. A coffer dam, two earth dikes, excavation and preparations of the foundations of the dam were also completed before construction began. The pouring of concrete commenced in November and work on the dam continued throughout the winter months.The conservation dam was an economical means to create a storage basis for power developments in both Ontario and Manitoba.  The construction of the dam had a dramatic impact on the lake due to a rise in water levels. Upper Ear Falls was drowned out by the dam, and well known landforms around the lake disappeared under the water level.Ontario Hydro played an instrumental role in the development of Ear Falls. The company realized that many of its generating stations in Northern Ontario were situated in isolated areas. In order to retain operators for these plants, the company recognized that they would need to supply quality housing, schools, recreation halls, stores, hospitals and other buildings. The company also supplied provisions for water supply, electrical services, sewage disposal and fire protection. In 1937, a colony was constructed at Ear Falls. Mining and forestry revival (1945-present)During the Second World War, there was a 50% decline in the gold mining industry in the Patricia District.  With the end of the war and the opening of Highway 105 in 1947, the mining industry in the region was renewed. Ear Falls was now linked by road to the Trans-Canada Highway and to Red Lake.At this time, the Chukuni Lumber Company was operating at Snake Falls. The operation consisted of a saw mill, a small box mill, and about a dozen houses lining the trail that ran through the lumber yards to the saw mill. The children of the workers were bussed to school in Ear Falls. By 1954, plans were made to move the mill operations to Ear Falls. The workers constructed houses north of the highway, along the hydro line. The Chukuni Lumber Company was eventually purchased by the Dryden Paper Company and in the late 1950s it was closed.In the early 1950s, ore deposits were discovered on Bruce Lake north of Ear Falls. In 1966 Stelco, an iron pelletizing plant, was developed in the area. The Canadian Northern Railway constructed a line to the mine which crossed highway 105 to the south of Ear Falls and the outlet of Lac Seul to the east of the dam. A new town site containing 100 residential units was developed in Ear Falls North of the dam. Today the mine is closed and the rail line has been abandoned. Tourism (1945-present)The construction of highway 105 helped to introduce tourism to the area with hunting and fishing camps were built on lakeshore sites along the highway. It also provided access points to Lac Seul, Cedar River and Chukuni River. Ear Falls is a natural funnel for supplies and services due to its location between Vermillion Bay and Red Lake, and due to its waterway access points.A tourist camp was built around the former Hudsons Bay store at Goldpines. For several years, old cabins at Sams Portage were rented out to tourists. Tourist camps were also operated at Little Canada and Snake Falls. Once the Ontario Hydro construction at Manitou Falls was completed and the lumber company had closed, the tourist industry became the economic mainstay of the Ear Falls community. Hunting and fishing have been a popular draw to the area for years, and more recently, ecotourism had added an additional element to the tourism experience of Ear Falls.Local mediaTelevision* CIER-TV channel 2 (community)* CICA-TV-11 channel 3 (Local TVO relay)* CBWJT channel 13 (Television; relays CBWT Winnipeg)ClimateServicesThe town offers essential services and shopping, and is equipped with restructured municipal water and sewage treatment plants to support its population.Other facilities include a new health clinic and multiplex.EducationEar Falls has an elementary school and day care service, while older children go to secondary school in Red Lake.ActivitiesEar Falls tourism is centered on outdoor recreation. It has numerous fishing and hunting camps located throughout the area, catering to both novice and seasoned fishermen alike. Each year during the hunting season, the town draws hundreds of hunters from all over the world.In the summer months, mountain biking, ATVs and hiking are ways to see the wildlife and experience the outdoors.  In the winter months, activities include snowmobiling, snow-shoeing and cross-country skiing.Ear Falls has a challenging 9 hole golf course located just minutes from downtown and features medium-sized greens that occasionally offer some slope, and narrow tree lined fairways that are generally flat. The 24 hour KinFit athletic facility features modern cardio and weight training equipment, and is located minutes from the town business center.Each year the community hosts the annual Trout Forest Music Festival (http://www.troutfest.com).ReferencesExternal links* Town of Ear FallsFalls (Ontario)

Strattons_Independence_Mine_and_Mill
Strattons Independence Mine and Mill is a historic mining site near Colorado on the south slope of Battle Mountain.Production outputBetween late 1893 and April 1899, approximately 200,000 ounces (5670 kg) of gold was removed from the Independence Mine. History In the spring of 1891 W. S. Stratton persuaded Popejoy to grubstake him in the Cripple Creek District in return for half the profits. Stratton staked two claims on the south slope of Battle Mountain on July 4, 1891. He called the two claims the Independence and the Washington in honor of the holiday. Stratton quickly sold his house and two lots, one in Denver and one in Colorado Springs, so that he could buy out Popejoys share. His reason: some assays from the Independence lode showed a value of $380 per ton gold. One boulder from the Independence mine brought $60,000, which Stratton used to sink a chute. In doing so he tapped directly into a rich vein. The next year, in 1892, Stratton also hit gold in the Washington mine. Stratton became the Cripple Creek Districts first millionaire.(All That Glitters&mdash;Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 43.)When Cripple Creek miners went on strike in 1894, Strattons Independence mine and the Portland mine came to an agreement with them, against the wishes of other mine owners.(All That Glitters&mdash;Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 55.) Stratton had incorporated the Portland company and was its first president and largest stockholder.(All That Glitters&mdash;Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 44.)Stratton developed a theory that the gold veins in the Cripple Creek District converged at a great depth, roughly in the shape of a goblet. This theory did not pan out, however.(All That Glitters&mdash;Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 66.)The mining companies became concerned about ore theft, and in 1897 they began hiring the services of Pinkerton agents.(All That Glitters&mdash;Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 71.)In 1900 Stratton sold the Independence mine to the Venture Corporation of London for $10 million.  The Venture Corporation incorporated the property as Strattons Independence Ltd. and sold shares on the London stock exchange.  The ore reserves were discovered to be less than previously thought in late 1900, and the share price crashed. Venture Corporation sued Stratton, claiming that the mine had been salted.  Stratton died in 1902, but his estate successfully defeated the lawsuit.In May 1900, two Federation of Miners (WFM) union representatives checked for union membership cards at the Independence mine. Approximately a hundred miners belonged to the union, and six or eight did not. One of the union representatives talked to the miners, who echoed the union reps view that they would prefer not to work alongside non-union workers. Mine Superintendent Summers talked the non-union men into joining the union in order to promote harmony in the workforce.(All That Glitters&mdash;Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 74.)In September 1900, the Independence mine was the first mine in the District to introduce a new stripping order requiring all underground workers to undress in one room of a change house and walk into another room in the nude while a guard observed. This was to take place at start and end of each shift. The new rule was implemented to prevent grading (theft of gold ore) by the mine workers. Five hundred miners met at Victors Armory Hall, and they decided that while they would help stop ore thieves, they refused to work under the stripping rule. A compromise was reached which allowed the miners to strip to their undergarments. But the miners were unhappy. After the new practice was in place for about a month, a Pinkerton searched the miners at the end of a shift. No ore was found, and the miners walked out. Three days later Independence mine manager A.H. Shipman met with the WFM Executive Board. He ultimately agreed to abolish the Pinkerton guard system, to appoint a guard for the change rooms from candidates the union proposed, and to accept a closed shop. Under the agreement, any miner suspected of high-grading could be searched by a fellow union member in the presence of a watchman. Shipman also announced that he would support membership in the WFM by miners in return for the unions help in stopping the practice of high grading.(All That Glitters&mdash;Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 71-72.)In 1902 the miners at the Independence mine bought diamond rings for Shipman, who had negotiated the closed shop, for Superintendent Sam Lobb, and for Assistant Manager R.J. Grant. The miners and the managers enjoyed a little smoking session at Shipmans home after the presentation.(All That Glitters&mdash;Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 102.)Colorado Labor WarsIn 1903 there was a major strike by the Western Federation of Miners. Many miners throughout the Cripple Creek District walked out of any mines that were shipping ore to the mills at Colorado City, in order to support a strike by the mill workers there. Cage mishap kills fifteenOn the night of January 26, 1904, non-union replacement workers were coming off shift in the Independence Mine when the cage that they were riding in had a serious mishap. The cage was drawn into the sheave wheel at the top of the shaft. The cable that supported the cage was severed, and the cage fell.(All That Glitters&mdash;Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 215.) Fifteen miners fell into the shaft, 1500 feet deep.(Mark Wyman, Hard Rock Epic, Western Miners and the Industrial Revolution, 1860-1910, 1979, page 100.)The investigation focused on safety arrangements, and the qualifications of the hoisting engineer.(Mark Wyman, Hard Rock Epic, Western Miners and the Industrial Revolution, 1860-1910, 1979, page 101.) One miner, James Bullock, survived the accident. His testimony to the coroners jury describes the disaster:. . . We kept going right along but it kept slipping; we would go a little ways and then we would slip again; then he took us about six feet above the collar of the shaft, then he lowered us back down.Q. Did he stop six feet above the shaft?A. He stopped just for a second or two; then he lowered us and it must have gotten beyond his control, for we dropped about sixty or seventy feet, we were going pretty. sic We said to each other we are all gone. Then he raised us up about ten feet; then he stopped us and it slipped back again, and we went to the sheave wheel as fast as we could go. When I was going up there, I began to crouch to save myself from the hard blow. I seen a piece of timber about one foot wide, and I grabbed hold and held myself up there and pretty soon the cage dropped and I began to holler for a ladder to get down.(Mark Wyman, Hard Rock Epic, Western Miners and the Industrial Revolution, 1860-1910, 1979, page 100-101.)The hoisting engineers testimony is also quite descriptive of the incident:I tried several times, but that time the cage was at the collar of the shaft. I immediately reversed the engine and sent the cage back 100 feet. I again tried the brakes, reversed the engine, and brought the cage back to the surface. The brake was still stuck; I could not move it. I again reversed the engine and sent the cage back about the same distance and stepped over to the other side and took hold of the other brake, and it was in the same condition. The second time the cage came to the surface, I called three times for the shift boss, for Gods sake come and help me put on the brakes. In the meantime, I was reversing the engine backwards and forwards. Mr. MacDonald came and two other men with him. I said come up and help me put on the brakes, and then I discovered the hood of the cage above the collar of the shaft. I immediately reversed the engine, but it was too late.(Mark Wyman, Hard Rock Epic, Western Miners and the Industrial Revolution, 1860-1910, 1979, page 100-101.)The coroners jury found the brakes had been inspected six hours before the accident, and the brakes were working after the accident.(Mark Wyman, Hard Rock Epic, Western Miners and the Industrial Revolution, 1860-1910, 1979, pages 101-102.) The coroners jury questioned another hoisting engineer from the Stratton Mine about the qualifications of the engineer operating the hoist. They learned that the employer had taken the mans word  nothing more  as to his qualifications. The engineer involved in the fatal accident, however, had been recommended by a former employer.(Mark Wyman, Hard Rock Epic, Western Miners and the Industrial Revolution, 1860-1910, 1979, pages 101-102.)The coroners report stated that the engineer had lost control because of managements negligence, having failed to properly install a safety device to prevent overwinding. Also, the braking system consisting of disk brakes on the hoisting engine had been detached.(All That Glitters&mdash;Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 215.)(Mark Wyman, Hard Rock Epic, Western Miners and the Industrial Revolution, 1860-1910, 1979, pages 101-102.) The Western Federation of Miners echoed the coroners charge of mismanagement. Although the property was at that time guarded by soldiers and enclosed by the main militia encampment, providing no access to union members, management accused the union of tampering with the  machinery.(All That Glitters&mdash;Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 215.) One hundred and sixty-eight non-union men reportedly quit the Independence Mine because of the incident.(All That Glitters&mdash;Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 215.) Just a few months later, after several violent incidents occurred in the district, the WFM was driven out by force of arms in a struggle that came to be called the Labor Wars.Notes

Inholding
An inholding is privately owned land inside the boundary of a park, national forest, park, or similar publicly owned, area.  Inholdings result from private ownership of lands prior to the designation of the protected park or forest area, which then end up grandfathered within the legally designated boundary.  In the States, the main causes of inholdings are checkerboarding due to railroad grants under the Railway Acts beginning in 1862, homestead claims under the 1862 Act, and mining claims patented under the Mining Act of 1872, along with the more recent Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971.  The railroad checkerboarding primarily affects national forests, while inholdings due to the other types of claims occur frequently within national parks and national forests throughout the United States.  Over the last several decades, conservation groups have lobbied the States Congress to acquire inholdings especially within designated wilderness areas, either by direct purchase or via land exchange which trades the inholding for other lands located outside of national parks or wilderness areas.According to the Colorado-based Wilderness Land Trust, the development of wilderness inholdings has the following adverse impacts:* Fragmentation of pristine ecosystems and environmental damage such as air and water pollution, soil erosion, loss of solitude and disruption of wildlife.* Nonconforming uses such as aircraft landings and motor vehicle intrusions.* Degradation of the wilderness experience of visitors due to physical structures and human activities.* Conflicts between land owners and visitors, and public outcry associated with proposed development.* Complex land ownership patterns make managing wilderness more expensive and time consuming for land agency officials, particularly when there is controversy.(See: What are the adverse impacts caused by the development of wilderness inholdings? http://www.wildernesslandtrust.org/about-wilderness.html)References and external links**Wilderness Land Trust*Nature Noted: Outing the Inholdings*National Inholders Association References (

Sibuyanons_Against_Mining
Sibuyanons Against Mining (SAM) is an environmental advocacy group organized primarily by Sibuyanons.It has been fighting for mining moratorium in Island (Philippines). It aims to protect the island where the worlds densest forest flourishes, the Philippines cleanest river flows and the majestic Guiting-Guiting dwells from future environmental degradation and exploitation.(The opposition of the islanders was noted in a document Mining in the Philippines: Concerns and Conflicts published by Society of St. Columban in 2007, West Midlands, UK written by Cathal Doyle of the Irish Centre for Human Rights, Clive Wicks of the IUCN, and Columban priest Frank Nally. SAM officials met the authors together with the MP Hon. Claire Short of the British Parliament.) History It was primarily an online advocacy created in February 2006 and formed formally on July 2, 2006 in Intramuros, Manila. From then on, it helped organize the creation of a worldwide environmental advocacy campaign against mining operations in Sibuyan Island. Advocacy The group adheres to responsible stewardship. Mining in the island is not sustainable because the island-people live by the islands bounties. Endemism and biodiversity are major factors why SAM is also looking for mining moratorium in the island since it is a center of endemism and critical plant site. They think that exploration could destroy the environment, the ecological balance, particularly the Mount Guiting-Guiting, which means posing a threat to the human beings of the area.(Fortuna, Julius F, East and West column, Manila Times. November 9, 2006.) On September 2, 2006, almost 8,000 people (first in the history of Romblon province) gathered in front of a mining site to express their environmental concern. The mobilization was realized in collaboration with the sambuligan or basic ecclesial communities of the Immaculate Conception Shrine Parish of Fernando, Romblon and the Vicariate of Sibuyan.Municipal of San Fernando, Councilor Hon. Armin Fajilan Rios Marin is known as heroes of Sibuyan for fighting against mining, Son of Mr. & Mrs. Domingo Marin of Espana, San Fernando, Romblon. Network The advocacy is now worldwide through its online petition and local and international environmental organizations support. SAM is also a member of the Philippines alliance against mining, Alyansa Tigil Mina. References  External links * Sibuyan ISLE Inc.

Whiteworks
Whiteworks (or White Works) is a former mining hamlet near the town of Princetown, within National Park, in the English county of Devon. Tin mining is central to the history of settlement at Whiteworks, which was once home to one of Dartmoors largest tin mines. The original cottages and their inhabitants were related to this industry, until the area became used increasingly for farming in the 20th century. The site has now largely been abandoned, although Whiteworks is still on the route of many walks.GeographyWhiteworks is situated in an area of open moorland about  south-east of Princetown, overlooking the notoriously dangerous Fox Tor Mires. A difficult path leads across the mires to Tor itself, which lies about  south-east of the hamlet. Vehicle access to Whiteworks is via a narrow dead-end road branching off from the B3212 at Princetown. This road is an extension of the one constructed by Thomas Tyrwhitt to his property at Royal.() The granite at Whiteworks has been subject to a process of kaolinisation: the feldspar minerals have decomposed to form a white clay known as kaolin.() As a result, when the tin ore cassiterite was mined there, it was white in colour, giving the name White Works to the site.There are a few species of moss particular to the Whiteworks area, namely urnigerum, which is found in streams, and  turbinatum.()()HistoryAccording to the evidence of stannary rolls, tin working at the Whiteworks mine site dates back to 1180, when it was associated with mediaeval field systems on the eastern edge of Tor.() More active mining began around 1790, when the Revolution began to fuel demand for tin, while also providing the technology to move from mining to subsurface methods, previously impossible on the difficult Dartmoor terrain.( Initially, there were no tin smelting houses operating in Devon, so Whiteworks sent tin ore to Calenick Smelting House, near the Cornish town of Truro.() Mining continued irregularly during the 19th century, accompanied by drainage work designed to make the Fox Tor Mire safer.() During part of this time the mine was one of the largest on Dartmoor, along with Eylesbarrow and Gobbet.(() At the beginning of the 1870s, for example, the mine produced 8-9 tons of tin ore per year.() At this time, the mine was owned by Tavistock-based mining entrepreneur Moses Bawden.( By the 1880s the mine was disused,()() although a revival of ore values at the beginning of the 20th century meant that mining activity was briefly recommenced. Mining at the site then ceased completely in 1914.() For these final years of activity, the mine was under shared ownership with Golden Dagger Mine and Hexworthy Mine.() Around the turn of the century, a new farmhouse had also been constructed,() and with the cessation of mining activity, the land around Whiteworks was increasingly used for livestock farming and breeding animals such as ponies.() By the 1980s, Whiteworks had mostly been abandoned and some of the buildings, including the farmhouse, were demolished by the Dartmoor National Park Authority.( A few cottages remain complete, one of which is owned by College and used as a base for outdoor activities.  Other buildings, related to previous mining or farming activities, lie in ruins, interspersed with the fenced-off remains of mine shafts. These ruins, combined with the surrounding geography, make Whiteworks a popular location for hikers, especially on walks starting in Princetown.Cultural referencesThe hamlet appears in the novel Misers Money, by Dartmoor author Phillpotts. The area around Whiteworks also provided inspiration to Conan Doyle for the Holmes story Hound of the Baskervilles: it is believed that the Fox Tor Mire is the location of the fictional Grimpen Mire, which would place Baskerville Hall on the site of the cottages at Whiteworks.()References

Sadri_Maksudi_Arsal
thumb|right|Sadreddin Maksudov. 1907.Sadreddin Nizamettinovich Maksudov or Sadri Maksudi Arsal (1878&ndash;February 20, 1957) was a prominent Tatar and Turkish statesman, scholar and thinker.BiographySadreddin Nizamettinovich Maksudov was born in Tasu, outside of Kazan, the son of a mullah, and the younger brother of Maksudi, the well-known Jadidist. After the traditional mektep and medreseh education, he took the (then) unusual step of entering the Russian Teachers College in Kazan (for which he was much criticized by his community at the time), then studied law in Paris.Four years later, in 1906, he returned to Russia and began political activities that displayed a liberal nationalist tendency. Maksudi became the leader of the Muslim faction in the Russian parliament. Sadri Maksudi Arsal was married to Kamile, the daughter of the gold-mining Rameev family of Orenburg, had two children - Adile and Naile. He died in Istanbul in 1957. He was interred at the Cemetery in Istanbul.Political Career in Imperial RussiaOn his return to Russia in 1906, thanks to the rights conferred in 1905 to all the subjects of the Czar, he entered politics in order to voice issues concerning the Tatar people and the Muslim community. He found himself elected at a very young age as a deputy of the (liberal) Party to the II. and III. Dumas. At the Duma, he favored a centrally administered cultural autonomy  for all Russias Muslims until it was apparent that the Volga Tatars, who mainly promoted this solution, had been abandoned by the other Turkic Muslims of the Russian Empire.Political Leader/Statesman  Maksudi was the leader of the first state formation (in the twentieth century) in his native State since the fall of the Khanate to the Moscovite princedom in 1552. Like all the other peoples within czarist Russia, the peoples of Russia undertook political ventures with the advent of the Revolution. After the various Moslem congresses taking place in 1917, during which different and conflicting opinions were expressed concerning the political future of the Turkic peoples of Russia, the National-Cultural Autonomy of the Turco-Tatars of Inner Russia and Siberia was proclaimed in Ufa (in present-day Bashkortostan) on July 1917, with a constitution drafted by Maksudi. General elections were held soon thereafter and a National Assembly (Milli Meclis) was convened in November. Maksudi was elected its president. The formation of a National Council composed of three ministries, also headed by Maksudi, followed. The autonomous government was gathering momentum with a project to turn itself into the independent State. But this was not to be. The Bolsheviks would not allow it. The National Assembly would stop convening and the National Council would be abolished by April 1918. After the defeat of the Tatar nationalists at the hands of Stalin and Tatar Communists, Maksudi emigrated to Finland. In 1919 he delievered a diplomatic note concerned with the demands of the Muslims of European Russia  to the Peace Conference, along with Gayaz Iskhaki. In the early 1920s Maksudi was in Berlin where he began a scholarly career which he vigorously continued after he arrived in Ankara in 1925.AcademiaScholar/Academic - Settled for a time in Paris, Maksudi started teaching the history of the Turks at the of Sorbonne. But a lecture tour he made in 1924 in the new Turkish Republic was to bring about a radical change in his life. In 1925 he received a letter from Hamdullah Suphi, then president of Trk Ocaklar (Turkish Hearths/Cultural Centers) informing him that Gazi hazretleri (His Excellency the Ghazi Atatrk) was inviting him to Turkey. In Turkey, Ord. Prof. Sadri Maksudi Arsal (as he would become eventually) emerged as a multi-faceted thinker, a scholar whose work in the fields of law, history, philosophy, linguistics and sociology made a rarely found contribution to the world of ideas and scholarship during the founding years of the Turkish Republic. A major figure in national history (he would be nominated a candidate at the presidential elections in 1950), Arsal tried to propagate his ideas through his books, scholarly writings, newspaper articles, lectures at the university, and speeches at the parliament. Man of law  A graduate of the Paris Faculty of Law, Arsal was one of the founding faculty members of the Ankara School of Law (as it was then called) opened in 1925. He taught for many years in that faculty then later at University. His Hukukun Umumi Esaslar (General Principles of Law, 1937), Hukuk Tarihi Dersleri (Lectures in the History of Law, 1938), Umumi Hukuk Tarihi (History of General Law, 1941), Hukuk Felsefesi Tarihi (History of the Philosophy of Law, 1946), and Trk Tarihi ve Hukuk (Turkish History and Law, 1947) have been valuable contributions to the development of the teaching of law in Turkey. However, his major contribution to legal studies has been his establishing the discipline of History of Turkish Law, a course which is today a standard element in legal studies curricula in Turkey. He laid the foundations of this course, and taught it for the first time in the world.Political Career in Turkish RepublicHe had a second career in Turkey, where he was invited to help build the newly founded Republic (and where he adopted the additional surname, Arsal), as a close associate of Atatrk, contributing to the reform as well as to the turn historiography would take, while at the same time serving as a member of parliament, and pursuing an academic career as a member of the faculties of law of Ankara and Istanbul universities  from which he would retire as an ordinarius professor. Member of Parliament - A frequent guest at Atatrks dinner table during meals that functioned as workshops or fora; or, put in another way, one of the persons whose advice Atatrk sought, Arsal was twice a member of parliament during the one-party period: a representative of ebinkarahisar between 1931 and 1935, and of Giresun between 1935 and 1939. He devoted himself totally to academic life after that, with the one exception between 1950 and 1954 when he was elected as a Demokrat Parti deputy representing Ankara.Influence (Scholar and Political)His influence on the establishment of the Language and Historical Societies  Arsal played a decisive role in the establishment of both the Society for the Study of the Turkish Language (later the Turkish Language Institution), and the Society for the Study of Turkish History (later Turkish Historical Institution). He authored much of Trk Tarihinin Anahatlar (Outlines of Turkish History, 1930), that reflected the official history of the period. Arsal has also made a major contribution to the language reform. He collected his essays on the subject in a volume titled Trk Dili in (For the Turkish Language, 1930), a work that was a turning point for the language reform and which Atatrk endorsed by writing a preface. Some of Atatrks compendious statements in that preface are oft repeated in our day and have been engraved on the inscription that is in front of the Trk Dil Kurumu (Turkish Language Institute) building in Ankara.Nationalist - Arsals last endeavor was to publish in 1955 Milliyet Duygusunun Sosyolojik Esaslar (Sociological Bases of the Nationalist Feeling) which he called his spiritual testament. Putting on paper a lifetimes study and reflection, Arsal discussed in this work the concept of nationality and developed a modern theory of nationalism. In the book, he argues that contemporary nationalism should distance itself from chauvinism and, just like the religious sphere did, adopt a rational stance.Works by Sadri Maksudi Arsal Books * Maksudi, S.

Westmoreland_County_Coal_Strike_of_19101911
The Westmoreland County Coal Strike of 19101911 was a strike by coal miners represented by the Mine Workers of America.  The strike is also known as the Slovak strike because about 70 percent of the miners were Slovak immigrants.(It began in County, Pennsylvania, on March 9, 1910, and ended on July 1, 1911.  At its height, the strike encompassed 65 mines and 15,000 coal miners.(McDonough, Worker Solidarity, Judicial Oppression, and Police Repression in the Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Coal Miners Strike, 19101911, Pennsylvania History, 1997.)(Cupp, 191011 Irwin Gas Coal Basin Strike Led to Industry Changes, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, February 23, 2007.) Sixteen people were killed during the strike, nearly all of them striking miners or members of their families.(Norwood, Strikebreaking and Intimidation, 2002.)The strike ended in a defeat for the union.BackgroundThe Irwin Gas Coal Basin is an area in Westmoreland and Venango Counties, Pennsylvania.  It encompasses the townships of North Huntingdon, Penn, Sewickley, Salem, South Huntingdon, Hempfield and Irwin, and the boroughs of Murrysville, Export and Delmont. The coal mined in the district was unsuitable for use as coke. However, it was ideal for gasification and conversion into coal gas.(Seven companies dominated coal mining in the Irwin Basin in 1910.  In 1854, the Coal Company was formed to begin mining coal in the region.  In 1905, it bought a controlling interest in Penn Gas Coal, a company established in 1861 to gasify coal. Penn Gas Coal, in turn, had obtained a one-third ownership in the Gas Coal Company. Through these purchases, Westmoreland Coal had a near-monopoly on the gas coal market, and was the largest coal company in the Pennsylvania.((Westmoreland Coal Company Historical Timeline, Westmoreland Coal Company, No date.) In 1892, Robert Jamison and his sons founded the Coal and Coke Company (originally the Jamison Coal Company).(Jamison Coal was sold to the Coal Company in 1947, and is now Energy. Van Atta, When Jamison Coal Was King, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, April 10, 1994.) In 1886, the Berwind family and Judge White founded the Coal Mining Co.(History, Berwind Co., 2004.) In 1902, a number of smaller coal gas companies in and around Pennsylvania, merged to form the Keystone Coal and Coke Company. In 1905, Coal and Coke Company was formed when W. Saxman merged three of his wholly owned or controlled coal companies.(First Saxman Settled Near Latrobe Shortly After Braddocks Defeat, Latrobe Bulletin, June 21, 1954.)These companies were very paternalistic. towns (colloquially referred to as coal patches) were established, company stores founded and workers often paid in scrip.((Fishback, Did Coal Miners Owe Their Souls to the Company Store? Theory and Evidence from the Early 1900s, Journal of Economic History, December 1986.)Origins of the strikeCoal miners increasingly agitated for improved wages and working conditions after 1900. Miners demanded an day and wages equal to those paid in the nearby Pittsburgh Coal Basin. Since miners were paid by the ton, workers also wanted to standardize the size of coal wagons to ensure they were paid fairly. Miners also sought to be paid for mining slack (very fine coal), and for dead work (laying of track, shoring up tunnels, pumping out water, and removing slate and clay).(Westmoreland Coal, Penn Gas Coal and Keystone Coal and Coke strongly resisted the miners demands and any attempt at unionization. Companies used the and Iron Police to physically intimidate and sometimes beat pro-union miners, workers were fired, and coal companies evicted families from the coal patches whenever miners struck.(The situation came to a head in 1910. The coal companies reduced wages by 16 percent, paying only 58 cents per ton-and-a-half of coal mined.  The breaking point came when Keystone Coal and Coke announced that miners would have to begin using new safety lights and new forms of explosivesand pay for these items themselves.(The strikeMiners unions had tried to organize Westmoreland County coal mines since 1883, but had little success.  In February 1910, however, the lower wage rates and new expenses led miners at Keystone Coal and Coke to meet and discuss their grievances among themselves.  The miners decided to invite the Mine Workers of America (UMWA) to form a union.(On March 7, 1910, Bittner, a UMWA vice president, arrived in Westmoreland County and formed a local union.  Four hundred miners signed up and paid dues.  Keystone Coke and Coal immediately fired 100 miners for attending the union organizing meeting. The Keystone miners walked off the job, and the strike swiftly spread throughout the Irwin Basin.(Union recognition became the biggest issue in the strike. The workers felt that if they could win recognition of the union, their other demands would come easily.((Report on the Miners Strike in the Bituminous Coal Field in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania in 19101911, U.S. House of Representatives, 1912.)When the miners struck on 9, the coal companies evicted thousands of families from their company-owned homes.  UMWA spent $25,000 purchasing tents and constructing shanties, and set up 25 tent cities to accommodate the homeless.  Near the town of Export, more than 100 tents went up, making it the largest tent city during the strike.((Ethnic tension threatened to divide the nascent union.  Slovakians comprised 70 percent of the striking miners, but the strike committee was led by native-born miners of English, German and Irish descent. UMWA organizers Bittner and Frank Hayes worked hard to overcome these divisions, however. Multi-lingual organizers were employed, each ethnic group elected its own representatives, and parades and rallies featured musicians and speakers from all groups.(Public backing for the strike was high. Westmoreland County had a long history of support for unions. Local religious leaders signed petitions in favor of the union, testified before the States Congress on behalf of workers, and called on the governor and state legislature to force the coal companies to submit to arbitration.(UMWA support for the strike, however, was not nearly as strong. International union president Thomas Lewis had not condoned the strike, and criticized efforts by leaders in surrounding UMWA Districts to drum up increased support for the strikers. But in March 1910, a special meeting of the UMWA international executive board voted to support the strike, forcing Lewis to grudgingly offer the unions resources.( Eventually, the union gave more than $1 million in relief payments to the strikers.( Lewis, however, continued to work to undermine the unions support for the strike. He backed an insurgent faction in District 6 to unseat leaders who supported the strike. The act led to internecine warfare in the union and charges that Lewis and his candidates were in league with mine owners.(StrikebreakersTo end the strike and break the union, the coal companies began importing thousands of Eastern European immigrants to work the mines. Coal company representatives on the East Coast promised immigrants a job and housing, and paid for them and their families to come to move to Pennsylvania. The flow of strikebreakers was small at first, but by the fall it was nearly a flood. The number of new immigrant workers was so large that the Penn Gas Coal company constructed 30 two-story houses in Hahntown to house its replacement workers, leading local residents to refer to the area as Scab Hill.(Management often took advantage of the strikebreakers, however. Company recruiters were ordered not to tell potential workers that they would be employed as strikebreakers. The coal companies sought out recent immigrants who did not speak English (or who spoke or understood it poorly), and then used this handicap against the strikebreakers. If workers tried to quit, the and Iron Police prevented them from leaving and told them that they had to work off the cost of their transportation before resigning. When strikebreakers still tried to leave, the police beat them and forced them back to work. In some cases, fences were built around strikebreaker housing to intimidate the workers into staying. The abuse of strikebreakers was so severe that the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Labor held hearings on whether the coal companies had illegally forced people into peonage.((The Hearings on H. R. 179, Authorizing Committee on Labor to Investigate Conditions Existing in Westmoreland Coal Fields of Pennsylvania, Committee on Rules, U.S. House of Representatives, May 31, 1911.)(In Herminie, a twelve-foot fence surrounded the barracks of the strikebreakers. Mine owner John Jamison told a local official, We are going to make strikebreakers a far sight more afraid of us than strikers. Kuritz, The Labor Injunction in Pennsylvania, 18911931, Pennsylvania History, July 1962.)(Peonage in Western Pennsylvania, Committee on Labor, U.S. House of Representatives, August 1, 1911.)Labor injunctions and other legal actionsEmployers also turned to the courts for assistance.  In April 1910, Keystone Coal and Coke sought a order to prevent striking miners from approaching company property on the grounds that the number of strikers and the loud noises they made intimidated company employees. Although the local sheriff testified that the strikers had committed no acts of violence, the state district court issued a sweeping injunction which essentially barred the union from use of public roads::Miners are restrained from conducting or engaging in marches to the mines, property and works of said Keystone Coal and Coke Company and from assembling at or near the works of said company for the purpose of holding meetings at such places at any time, and from assembling on the highways at such places where the employees of the said company ordinarily pass to and from their work, and from preventing said employees from going peaceably along said injunction: highways and also from attempting by noise, intimidation, threats, personal violence or by any other means to interfere with the employees of said company in their desire to labor or with any of the property of the said company until further order of this court.(Cited in McDonough, Worker Solidarity, Judicial Oppression, and Police Repression in the Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Coal Miners Strike, 19101911, Pennsylvania History, 1997.)The vague terms of the injunction led law enforcement officials to arrest miners as much as a half mile from Keystone grounds. Other coal companies quickly asked for similar injunctions which made marching, assembling or traversing public roads illegal.((McDonough, Worker Solidarity, Judicial Oppression, and Police Repression in the Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Coal Miners Strike, 19101911, Pennsylvania History, 1997, p. 395.)(The court injunctions issued in the Westmoreland County Coal Strike were not only applied in later strikes in Pennsylvania but was extended even further. Kuritz, The Labor Injunction in Pennsylvania, 18911931, Pennsylvania History, July 1962.)The coal companies moved aggressively to exploit the law in other ways as well.  The Coal and Iron Police patrolled company property and denied admittance to union members and supporters. Union members were often arrested for using public roads which traversed company property.(Kuritz, The Labor Injunction in Pennsylvania, 18911931, Pennsylvania History, July 1962.) Small towns and villages, often encircled by coal company land, became isolated and embattled. In Herminie, all citizens were required to obtain a pass from the local mine manager before leaving the village. Union members were denied the use of post offices or the ability to enter local courthouses, because these facilities were often on coal company property. Nearly 1,000 miners were ultimately arrested for trespass or disorderly conduct.(( Simply walking home in a group from a union meeting on a public highway could earn a contempt citation and a $50 fine.((In 1911, seven coal companies in Westmoreland County and Allegheny County sued the leaders of the strike. The coal companies claimed they had suffered economic losses as high as $500,000 due to the strike and strike-related property damage. Twenty-eight officers in nearby District 5 and 17 strike leaders in Westmoreland County were arrested on charges of conspiracy, intimidation, violence and general lawlessness. Local labor unions helped the 45 men post bond of $300 each, and instituted a special per capita assessment to form a legal defense fund. But the public outcry was so extraordinary that the coal companies dropped the suits.((Use of security personnelEmployers also used force to intimidate striking miners. At their disposal were the and Iron Police, local law enforcement personnel, and the State Police.*The Coal and Iron Police primarily protected company property, protected strikebreakers, and kept strikebreakers from quitting.(((( But in many ways, their role in the strike was quite limited.*deputies and local police deputies proved to be a much bigger problem. The coal companies paid the Westmoreland County sheriff to provide deputies to protect their property and replacement workers (a common practice at the time). Although the sheriffs deputies would be acting under the color of law, they were paid for and under the control of the coal companies. The Westmoreland County sheriff obtained many deputies through detective agencies notorious of their strikebreaking activities, but nevertheless instructed the deputies to exercise restraint and ignore peaceful marches.  He also warned them that he would dismiss deputies who committed acts of violence.(Despite this, sheriffs deputies instigated and participated in three particularly violent and deadly incidents:*On May 8, 1910, sheriffs deputies attempted to prevent a handful of strikebreakers from permanently quitting their jobs at the Westmoreland Coal Company in the town of Yukon, Pennsylvania. About four hours after the replacement workers had returned to their boarding house, 25 sheriffs deputies and Pennsylvania state policemen broke into and searched the boarding house. A crowd of striking miners gathered and ridiculed their failure to find the workers. The furious and embarrassed sheriffs deputies then fired into the crowd. Thirty people were injured and one man killed.(( The Westmoreland County sheriff withdrew the commissions of 18 deputies involved in the incident, but the Westmoreland Coal Company had them sworn in as local police deputies instead.(*Shortly after the Yukon incident, a small group of miners walking home from a meeting in Export passed coal company property. A squad of 20 sheriffs deputies and State Police troopers attacked them. Several miners were severely beaten, and one miner (trying to protect a child in his arms) was killed.(*In July 1910, striking miners secured a march permit from the town of South Greensburg. As the miners began their march, deputy sheriffs and Coal and Iron Police on horseback stopped them. Although the local chief of police stepped forward and told the deputies that the miners had permission to march, the deputies ignored him and continued to block the marchers. The miners attempted to walk away, but the deputies charged into them with their horses, swinging clubs. A riot ensued and the sheriffs deputies fired into the crowdkilling a miner. When the chief of police attempted to arrest the deputy responsible, the other deputies seized him and charged him with obstructing an officer in the performance of his duty. Outraged citizens of the town mobbed the sheriffs office and forced his release.(Problems with the deputies were so severe that in November 1910 the Westmoreland County sheriff stopped securing them for the coal companies. The companies responded by seeking deputies from local police forces instead.(In January 1911, the Westmoreland County sheriff began deputizing striking miners as deputy sheriffs (although they served without pay). In May 1911, four sheriffs deputies were cited for contempt of court for venturing too close to coal company property. The sheriff said that the men had done so in their official capacity as deputies, but the local court fined them anyway.(( The Westmoreland County sheriff became so frustrated with the injunction that he refused to permit his deputies to patrol marches on public highways.(The State Police (PSP) proved to be the most violent group during the strike. The PSP had been founded in 1905 to discourage the use of private police forces in workers strikes and to provide law enforcement when local police or sheriffs were unable or unwilling to enforce the law. But rather than enforce the law, the PSP proved the group most willing to break it. One trooper described how the State Police dealt with strikers: We ride in, scoop them up and beat hell out of them.((McDonough, Worker Solidarity, Judicial Oppression, and Police Repression in the Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Coal Miners Strike, 19101911, Pennsylvania History, 1997, p. 397.)The number of unprovoked violent acts committed by the PSP was extremely high and frequent.  Maurer, a socialist member of the General Assembly from Reading, conducted a survey asking for information on State Police actions during the strike. Maurers survey found that violence significantly increased after the arrival of the State Police, and that almost all acts of violence were committed by state troopers without provocation. Mauer was so outraged by the results of his survey that he introduced a bill to abolish the state police.( Hundreds of citizens later testified before state and federal commissions that mounted State Police routinely charged onto town sidewalks or into crowds, trampling and severely injuring men, women and children (whether strikers or not). Severe beatings with fists and clubs were common, with troopers breaking into and ransacking homes without warrants, beating citizens and striking miners alike. Local police officials claimed State Police routinely beat people on the street for no reason, and resisted local police attempts to stop them. State Police troopers shot up towns in true Western style, and fired indiscriminately into crowds or into tent cities (killing and wounding sleeping women and children). Sexual assault (including rape) was disturbingly common, and at least one hotel manager accused troopers of promoting prostitution.(State Police were also involved in a number of serious violent incidents, several of which resulted in the deaths of unarmed strikers:*In May 1910, State Police allegedly killed a man in cold blood. Several State Police officers and a coal company executive stopped and questioned four striking miners who did not speak English. An English-speaking miner who spoke their language came on the scene and told the four men to run off.  They did so and escaped, but the State Police troopers chased the fifth man into a barn. The miner was shot and killed. The numerous witnesses testified that the miner was begging for his life when a State Trooper shot him. But the other troopers and a coal company executive stated that the miner was killed in self-defense, and the trooper was exonerated.((*In May 1911, State Police assaulted a group of striking miners on a public road. The miners, on their way to a meeting, walked past property owned by the Jamison Coal and Coke Company. The road narrowed where a creek ran past the property.  The mounted State Police troopers blocked the mines path at this point, then charged into the crowd. Two miners were shot and several severely beaten. A Westmoreland County sheriffs deputy accompany the miners was also badly beaten.((*In June 1911, miners secured a permit to march past facilities owned by the Penn Gas Coal Company. As the marchers peacefully walked past the companys front gate, State Police opened fire.  More than 150 shots were fired, causing panic and several injuries. Westmoreland County sheriffs deputies (all miners) identified three of the troopers and went to Penn Gas Coal Company to arrest them. Instead, State Police and Coal and Iron Police arrested the deputies for violating the court injunction. A court sentenced the deputies to five days in jail. When the Westmoreland County sheriff refused to put his deputies in jail, the court ordered the sheriffs arrest and charged him with malfeasance. Despite the pleas of a jury, the court sentenced the sheriff to one year and three months in solitary confinement and hard labor.((During the strike, six striking miners, nine wives of striking miners, and one bystander were killed, and thousands of strikers and members of their families severely beaten or wounded.((End of the strikeBy mid-1911, the strike had taken its toll on the coal companies. At least $500,000 had been spent on security, and coal production had dropped by 45 percent.( The larger companies, however, used their reserves and income from non-mining operations (such as rental properties, company stores and even breweries) to withstand the economic pressure exerted by the miners. But all companies benefited from a significant slump in the demand for coal in 1910 and 1911, which leveled the playing field vis-a-vis their competitors.(But the miners were worse off than the employers. The winter of 191011 was particularly cold, and the miners and their families suffered tremendously. The union built numerous shacks and shanties, and moved miners families out of tents and into the shacks for better protection from the elements. But not enough shelter could be erected, and 400 families spent the entire winter in tents. Hunger and disease were also beginning to become widespread among strikers families.((In early 1911, the UMWAs support for the strikers appeared strong. In January 1911, Lewis lost the presidency of UMWA to John P. White. White fully backed the strike, and the UMWA convention reaffirmed the unions support for the miners.(But just six months later, the UMWA called a halt to the strike. The union had disbursed more than $1 million in relief funds, but it was no longer financially able to keep the strike going.( On July 1, 1911, the UMWA executive board voted to end to the strike. Although most miners returned to work, about 400 were blacklisted and forced to seek employment outside Pennsylvania.((Womens ResistanceThe Westmoreland County Coal Strike was the setting for one of the more colorful incidents in the life of Harris Jones, better known as Mother Jones. Even though she was 73 years of age, Mother Jones agreed to travel to Westmoreland County to support the United Mine Workers in their strike.Singing womenA number of miners wives had been arrested in the summer of 1910 for harassing strikebreakers and company security personnel.(Jones encouraged the women to bring their babies and small children with them when they were sentenced by the court in Greensburg. The presiding judge sentenced the women to pay a $30 fine or serve 30 days in jail. Unable to pay, the women were jailed. As there was no one else to care for the children, the judge was forced to jail the children along with their mothers.While the women were being processed for imprisonment, Jones instructed them:  You sing the whole night long. You can spell one another if you get tired and hoarse. Sleep all day and sing all night and dont stop for anyone. Say youre singing to the babies. I will bring the little ones milk and fruit. Just you all sing and sing.(Harris Jones: The Autobiography of Mother Jones. 4th ed., 1996.)Unfortunately, the jail was next door to the sheriffs home, as well as several hotels, lodging houses, and other homes. The sound of women singing all through the night kept most of the townspeople awake.  After five days of sleeplessness, the townspeople angrily demanded that the judge order the womens release. He did so.(The incident has become known as the women who sang their way out of jail.Notes(References*Cupp, Bob. 191011 Irwin Gas Coal Basin Strike Led to Industry Changes. Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.

Chill Factor is the fifteenth book in the series of Deathlands. It was written by James under the house name Axler. Plot synopsisArriving in New Mexico via a MAT-TRANS jump, Cawdor, Wroth, B. Dix, Theophilus Tanner, and Wyeth are met by Lauren, who informs them that Ryans son Dean was ambushed and kidnapped by slavers while he was left in Jaks care. Jaks wife, Christina, was able to capture a mortally wounded slaver and under torture extract information about the group he belongs to. All are surprised to learn that the group is not regional, but instead makes use of the MAT-TRANS chambers and their last destination setting to capture slaves from throughout the Deathlands. What is most troubling for Ryan, however, is the name of the groups leader: Major-Commandant Gregori Zimyanin, a man Ryan has encountered two times previously.After taking a day to rest at the Lauren ranch and construct a plan, Ryan and Jak set out alone to rescue Dean, not taking the entire group so as to better function covertly. Though they anticipate a cold destination based on various clues and statements from the captured slaver, both are only minimally prepared when the MAT-TRANS jump takes them to a brutally cold redoubt. As they make their way through the facility they come across three cuddlies, small, furred, foot-long animals reputed to be both highly friendly and cute. This turns out to be only half true, which Jak and Ryan both discover when the seemingly benign cuddlies turn vicious once they get close to the pair. After a struggle, both are able to kill the surprisingly lethal animals. Ryan narrowly avoids injury, but Jak is wounded in a few places, the worst being a long cut on his jaw which refuses to stop bleeding. Though not lethal if treated, the wound is severe enough that it will likely become infected and gangrenous in the bitter cold. Both Jak and Ryan agree there is no other choice, and Jak returns to New Mexico through the MAT-TRANS.Ryan reaches the exit of the redoubt and immediately spots the slavers base: a large sulfur mine, well-guarded and operated by slave labor, surrounded on all sides by barren, mountainous terrain. He decides to wait until nightfall to make his approach, and ventures further into the redoubt to find a place to rest. While exploring an abandoned testing office Ryan inadvertently activates a set of five prototype sec hunters: androids programmed to identify a target by their DNA and then hunt them ceaselessly. Ryan only becomes aware of this several hours later, when the first droid appears and tries to kill him. The sec hunter proves all but impervious to gunfire, but with some difficulty Ryan manages to destroy the droid by pushing it off the edge of a cliff. His victory is short-lived, as a few hours later the second sec hunter attacks, nearly killing him while he sleeps. After defeating the second hunter, Ryan heads to the test chamber to meet the third as it activates; eventually it does, but malfunctions spectacularly, attacking and destroying itself. The fourth and fifth sec hunters do not activate, and Ryan cautiously departs with the hope that the onslaught is over.Ryan makes his way down the treacherous mountain path and is eventually forced to seek shelter from a harsh blizzard. He finds the entrance to an abandoned mine tunnel, occupied by Kate Webb and her elderly grandfather Cody, two slaves who have escaped from the mine but have discovered they have nowhere to flee to. Cody is abruptly killed soon after when the fourth sec hunter emerges from the blizzard, following Ryan and killing Cody because he was in the way. Kate and Ryan flee deeper into the mine, eventually losing the droid by jumping over a large chasm blocking the tunnel. Venturing deeper they discover a fast-moving underground river, which unexpectedly swells and draws them into it. They are briefly stopped by a net strung across the river by trackies - hostile mutants - and after nearly being killed by a large group of them Kate and Ryan take their chances in the river again. When the finally find themselves outside again and on land Ryan narrowly manages to get both of them to the shelter of a small cave and start a fire before they succumb to the cold. Grateful for him saving her life, Kate seduces Ryan into having sex with her.Back in New Mexico Jak has returned safely home. During breakfast one morning he mentions that Christina has been ill recently; at Doc Tanners questioning he confirms that his wife has been sick only in the mornings, but fails to understand the significance. Sometime later the companions notice a large dust cloud moving in their direction. Christina, equipped with binoculars, can make out a slow-moving group of horses and people at its center, but cannot tell if they are simply another peaceful oxen train or something else. Preparations begin for either eventuality.The next morning Ryan and Kate sneak into the sulphur mine, slipping unnoticed into a work crew and passing themselves off as other slaves. From there Ryan and Kate attempt to locate Dean, carefully moving from crew to crew over the next several days. Meanwhile Dean is doing his best to avoid the attention of Zimyanin, who has met the boy a few times over the past days and finds him unsettlingly familiar, but cannot place why. The Major-Commandant only realizes the connection several days later, conveniently when Dean is recovering from a near-fatal mine collapse in the infirmary and Ryan himself has been detained in chains for disobeying sec men while attempting to rescue his son. Zimyanin arrives at Ryans jail just minutes too late; Kate has managed to kill the jails guards and free Ryan, and both are gone by the time Zimyanin arrives. The Major-Commandant posts extra guards on Dean, but Ryan stages a mass escape, forcing most of Zimyanins sec men to round up escaped slaves. Ryan and Kate rescue Dean in the confusion and flee to a disused mining equipment warehouse. Fearing the possibility of a revolt, Gregori orders all remaining slaves executed.Zimyanin has his sec men surround the warehouse, then proceeds in alone. The game of cat-and-mouse between him and Ryan is interrupted when the fourth sec hunter makes itself known by decapitating Kate. Dean and Ryan flee from the droid along elevated metal catwalks with Zimyanin in pursuit; the three of them wind up trapped between a fallen section of catwalk and the advancing sec hunter. Ryan negotiates a brief truce with the Major-Commandant, carefully leaving out that the sec hunter is primarily interested him alone. Zimyanin attempts to confront the droid head-on, which ends with the robot breaking his right arm. The brief confrontation causes the catwalk to shift and drop slightly, which the robot has difficulty coping with; noticing this, the three deliberately rock the catwalk violently, eventually causing one end of a section to break free and drop. Zimyanin blocks a last-ditch effort by the sec hunter to attack Ryan and forcibly throws it from the catwalk to its destruction, but ends up hanging one-handed from a severed support cable. Despite the risks (and against the oft-repeated advice of the Trader) Ryan moves to help Gregori back onto the catwalk. However, Dean refuses to let him live, taking aim with his pistol at the Major-Commandant. Rather than force the young boy to kill him, Zimyanin deliberately lets go, falling to his death. Ryan and his son make their way down from the catwalk and escape to the redoubt under the cover of a snowstorm.The MAT-TRANS takes Ryan and Dean back to New Mexico without incident. As they exit the ruins of the redoubt Ryan spots a large column of smoke in the distance, coming from the direction of the Lauren ranch.Cultural referencesAs Ryan and Jak are riding away from the Lauren farm, Doc Tanner runs after them for a moment while calling out, Shane, mirroring the end of the film of the same name.While attempting to shake the sec hunter from the warehouse walkway, Zimyanin refers to Ryan and Dean as his droogs, a fictional slang word for friends featured in Clockwork Orange.External links*JamesAxler.com

El_Musel
thumb|200px|thumb|right|Highway net and railwayLocated in Asturias, in the north of Spain, and in the middle point of the Sea coast, the Port of Gijn is often seen as an ideal gateway to Europe, allowing direct access to the western and centre of the Iberian Peninsula.Gijn is an excellent logistic platform for companies in its hinterland. The A-66 Madrid-Asturias highway and the Cantabrian highway ensure that goods are transported fast to and from the industrial areas of Valladolid, Madrid, the Basque Country, Lisbon and Oporto, among others. The port has all the necessary services and infrastructure for railway transport with a direct connection to the national railway net, RENFE, as well as a TECO station, container terminal, with a daily link to the European combined transport network.The Port of Gijn is the leader in the Spanish bulk traffic, the sixth in the general ranking of Spanish ports and the fourth in benefits. It is equipped with the most advanced installations, adequate and suitable for any traffic. History thumb|200px|thumb|rightThe El Musel port was built as a result of the industrial revolution that began in the second half of the 19th century in Asturias, based on iron and steel manufacturing and more particularly on coal mining in the central basins of the region. Right from the start, these two industrial activities were to be promoted by bankers and native and essentially foreign experts. Alejandro Aguado, Pedro Duro Benito, Policarpo Herrero Vzquez, Jos Tartiere Lenegre, Luis Belaunde Costa, Numa Guilhou, Adriane Paillette, Guillermo Schulz, Luis Adaro Magro, Jernimo Ibrn Mul and Isidoro Clausel de Coussergues are just some of the most representative names in an extensive group of industrialists and experts who were the true originators of Asturian industrialisation. The implementation of these industries was in turn to promote the progress of trade, the growth of the main urban centres and the adaptation of new communicational routes in the shape of roads, rail and ports, introducing a new capitalist production system into the region in contrast to the traditional agricultural economy.Since the 1840s, mining-industrial development was to reveal the deficient state of tracks and roads and the inadequacy of the Asturian port facilities. The regions rough orthography made communications with the Castilian meseta difficult by both road and rail (the Gijn-Oviedo-Len line over the Pajares bridge did not begin running until 1884) and the only way of ensuring the sale of the new industrial products was by sea, leading the need for a large commercial port in the central area close to mines and factories. Back then, the Port of Gijn was a small dock left dry at low tide, completely inadequate to meet the demands of the new economic situation. Several alteration and extension projects were then presented by the likes of the French engineer Eugene Flachat (1848-1850) and by Jos Elduayen, (approved in 1853), the engineer to have planned the Langreo Railway that took the coal from the Naln basin to the local docks of Gijn as of 1857, completing the communications between Sama and Gijn that began with the building of the coal road between 1838 and 1842. Another project was drafted by Pedro Antonio de Mesa in 1856, of which the part corresponding to the Santa Catalina or Lequerica sea wall was completed in 1864 to shelter vessels from storms while waiting their turn to load cargo. By the end of the century, projects were still being approved to enlarge the Bomb (now Claudio Alvargonzlez street) and Santa Catalina quays that, after continuous delays, were not completed until the start of the next century.The growing demand for port infrastructures and the lack of means from the public authorities led to the involvement of private initiative in the enlarging, building and operating of the Local Port of Gijn. Hence, in 1870 Anselmo Cifuentes was awarded the tender to build the Victoria or El Muelln quay (where the former fish market building is located) and in 1879 La Sociedad del Fomento de Gijn was constituted to build and run the quays and docks on his behalf. Moreover, the increase in traffic and fleets from the coal industry also led to the establishing of ship repair and construction shops, with the installation in 1888 of the first industrial shipyard in Gijn on Natahoyo beach in 1888, the wharf of the company Cifuentes, Stoldtz y Ca. and today home to Gijn.All of this intense activity confirmed the urgent need to kit out larger facilities to provide docks and service areas in line with the intense port traffic that existed. The shortfalls thus left the port open to new alternatives or solutions.In 1934, Marcellino Antuna Castillo was born in the Musel, of Alicia Castillo and Andrs Antuna. Now he is the grand father of Quentin, the singer-guitarist of K Tal, a famous rock band from Angoulme, and Dorian, a faboulous pupil of Mr Nieto-Jones, the Chuck Nurriss cousin, and Lou-Anne a futur star of dance.In 1986, the bulk carrier de Salas ran aground while anchored outside El Musel. The ship was waiting for its turn to dock in the busy port. Port of Gijn Expansion thumb|200px|thumb|rightThe Port of Gijn is the top bulk port in the Spanish ports system with an average annual traffic of more than 20 million tons the last years, 16 million of which are unloaded through the EBHISA dry bulk terminal. This terminal, designed in 1992 to unload a maximum of 12 million tons, has improved its unloading facilities and quays to deal with up to 17 million tons a year, although with occupancy indexes above that advised and with a vessel draught limit of 18 metres, which is detrimental to the service provided and a lack of competitiveness in relation to other ports .The forecast for iron ore and coal traffic at the Port of Gijn by the year 2010 stands at 20 million tons, notably exceeding the capacity of the present terminal.Enlarging the Port of Gijn will allow for modern, new facilities capable of meeting the needs of its customers, adapting to future demand and serving the modernisation of Asturian industry.The actual expansion project of the Port of Gijn consists of constructing a new breakwater that, starting from Cape Torres and running for a total length of 3,834 metres along three differently structured alignments, was to form a wharf containing 140 Ha of sheltered waters. It also includes the construction of a quay located to the north of the wharf that measured 1,250 metres in length with draughts ranging between 23 and 27 metres and a width of over 400 m to allow for the simultaneous berthing of three bulk carriers of  and 20 metres of draught. The inner slopes located to the West and South of the wharf complete the backfill protection, with a length of 1,732 m to give a total surface area of 145 Ha with land entirely reclaimed from the sea.The new dry bulk terminal to be established in these facilities will have an unload capacity of over 25 million tons and a 60 Ha storage area to allow for the storing of up to 2 million tons of iron ore and coal.Image:Expansion.jpg|Expansion projectImage:Expansion3.jpg|Type Cross sectionsImage:Expansion2.jpg|Situation foreseen for 2008Investments underwayNew Aboo Musel ConnectionThis investment was started due to the considerable increase in traffic between the Marcelino quay bulk terminal and the storage area concession on the Aboo quay level through the present tunnel that does no meet the appropriate conditions due to its sections, access slopes and complicated layout.The new track starts where the Norte Dock meets Cape Torres and includes a 390m long tunnel before running parallel to the Cape slope along the Aboo quay level to reach the current road.This track will be eminently for use by the port and, where applicable, will also allow for access to the port expansion work, separating any local traffic that may continue to use the present tunnel.Aboo Quay Level EnlargementThis involves the provision of a 85,000 m2 area next to the northern side of the current quay level, moving the enclosure around 220 m and extending the channelling of the estuary. The enclosures will be 240m along the aforementioned extension and 430m west-east to reach the rock wall of Cape Torres.These containment walls will be made up of different sections according to the stretch, with a paving core and 50 to 4,000 kg layers of riprap and blocks of 15 to 80 t. A concrete containing wall will be built with a similar mass to the current one.It must be noted that, given the extensive experience of this Port Authority in the recovery of blocks, the work is to be carried out using almost all existing blocks and containing walls, which will involve a thorough study of the process to dismantle the present dock and its transferral to the new one to ensure it is protected at all times and to ensure that the least amount of risks possible are taken with regard to the present facilities.La Osa Quay Enlargement (investment underway)The La Osa quays take their name from the sandbank of the same name on which the Levante dock was built, which protects the port from north-easterly storms. The Levante dock runs over the La Osa and La Figar sandbanks and gave its name to the most ambitious project of the Port of Gijn in the 20th century and that formed the El Musel we know today.This dock, the building of which began in 1964, together with its breakwater, has become absorbed by the La Osa Quays Enlargement project except for its initial section, reclaiming  from the sea and protected by a sloping dock measuring around . in length and with variable sections.The project consists of two independent actions: A barrage and a surface area enlarging the La Osa Quays and additional Backfill of the La Osa Quays, the backfill being obtained from the dredging of sand from the port entrance.The total budget amounts to 38,000,000 euros.This project, co-financed by the European Union, assists in the reduction of social and economic disparities among EU citizensReferencesAutoridad Portuaria Gijn(External links* Autoridad Portuaria Gijn* Official website of GijnMuselde Gijnportua

Economic_history_of_Peru
The economic history of Peru has its traditional roots in natural resources such as mining, farming, fishing, and agriculture. In precolonial times, during the reign of the empire, the economy was mainly agricultural, though it reached some animal husbandry and mining development. The primary goal of the Incan economy was substinence, with a system based on reciprocity and exchange of products.In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in slight industries, services, and high technologies. In 2007, the Peruvian economy grew 9%, the largest growth rate in the world.Pre-colonialThe Tahuantinsuyo was organized in dominions with a stratified society, in which the ruler was the Inca. It was also supported by an economy based on the collective property of the land. In fact, the Inca Empire was conceived like an ambitious and audacious civilizing project, based on a mythical thought, in which the harmony of the relationships between the human being, nature, and gods was truly essential. The economy was mainly agricultural, though it reached some animal husbandry and mining development. The primary goal of the Incan economy was substinence, with a system based on reciprocity and exchange of productsColonialThe colonial economy was dominated by mineral wealth, and labor was initially provided through enslavement of the indigenous peoples. Perus precious mineral resources and large indigenous population placed it at the core of the South American colonies; according to Palmer, Peru could be ranked second on a scale of colonial penetration (Mahoney, 66). Textiles, minerals, and sugars from the colonies were exported back to Europe.After the war of succession of 1700, Spain began to lose its monopoly over colonial trade. In the mid-18th century, liberal factions began to appear within the colonial elite; these questioned the legitimacy of the crowns rule in the Americas. These Creole patriots, which had originally been marginalized to the periphery of the empire (Venezuela, Argentina, etc.), provided the necessary conditions for successful economic development during the late colonial period (Mahoney, 52, 80). The introduction of free trade led to explosive growth throughout the empire, with Spain receiving ten times more imports by the end of the 18th century. Despite this overall growth of the colonies, the trend observed in Peru over the course of the century and a half following the war of secession was one of stagnation. The regional socioeconomic hierarchy inverted itself, as core territories where liberals were absent experienced much lower levels of economic development. Their marginalization actually allowed them to benefit from expanded trade opportunities. According to Mahoney, regional specialists have argued that underdevelopment throughout such as Peru can be traced to colonial patterns of economic dependence, Hispanic culture, and inefficient markets and economic arrangements. Attempting to protect its colonial possessions and reverse its faltering role in colonial trade, the crown implemented liberalizing reforms, hastening the removal of trade restrictions and weakening colonial monopolies. This continued the decay of the core regions, leaving them more exposed to the uncertainties of the free market. By the mid-19th century, the reversal of the socioeconomic hierarchy was complete; Peru would not recover its Viceroyalty-era supremacy (Mahoney, 86).Post-colonialPeru embarked on a railroad building program. Henry Meiggs built a standard gauge line from Callao across the Andes to the Interior, Huancayo; striking for Cuzco he built the line but also bankrupted the country.In 1879, Peru entered the War of the Pacific which lasted until 1884. Bolivia invoked its alliance with Peru against Chile. The Peruvian Government tried to mediate the dispute by sending a diplomatic team to negotiate with the Chilean government, but the committee concluded that war was inevitable. Chile declared war on April 5, 1879. Almost five years of war ended with the loss of the department of Tarapac and the provinces of Tacna and Arica, in the Atacama region.Originally Chile committed to a referendum for the cities of Arica and Tacna to be held years later, in order to self determine their national affiliation. However, Chile refused to apply the Treaty, and both countries could not determine the statutory framework. In an arbitrage that both countries admitted, the USA decided that the plebiscite was impossible to take, therefore, direct negotiations between the parties led to a treaty (Treaty of Lima, 1929), in which Arica was ceded to Chile and Tacna remained in Peru. Tacna returned to Peru on August 29, 1929. The territorial loss and the extensive looting of Peruvian cities by Chilean troops left scars on the countrys relations with Chile that have not yet fully healed.After the War of the Pacific, an extraordinary effort of rebuilding began. The government started to initiate a number of social and economic reforms in order to recover from the damage of the war. Political stability was achieved only in the early 20th century.20th centuryOn October 29, 1948, General Manuel A. Odra led a successful military coup and became the new President. Thanks to a thriving economy, Odra was able to implement expensive, populist social reconstruction, including housing projects, hospitals, and schools. His government was dictatorial, however, and civil rights were severely restricted, and corruption was rampant throughout his rgime. juntas continued to majoritarily rule Peru over the next three decades. The economic policies of the 50s, 60s, and 70s in particular, were based on the substitution of imports, and had little effect on the size of the economy. General Morales Bermdez replaced leftist General Velasco Alvarado in 1975, citing Velascos economic mismanagement, among other factors. Morales Bermdez brought about a more conservative period, beginning the task of restoring the countrys economy. In 1980, after 12 years of military rule, Belande Terry was elected President. After a promising beginning, his popularity eroded under the stress of inflation, economic hardship, and terrorism; his governments lukewarm liberalization attempt failed in the context of the American debt crisis, as per capita income declined, Perus foreign debt burgeoned, and violence by leftist insurgents (notably Path) rose steadily during the internal conflict in Peru, which was launched the day before Belandes election. He continued many of the projects that were planned during his 1963-1968 term, including the completion of the Carretera Marginal de la Selva, a roadway linking Chiclayo on the Pacific coast with then-isolated northern regions Amazonas and San Martn.During the next years, the economic problems left behind by the junta government persisted, worsened by an occurrence of the Nio weather phenomenon in 198283, which caused widespread flooding in some parts of the country, severe droughts in others, and decimated the schools of ocean fish that are one of the countrys major resources.Belandes successor, Garca, was elected to office in 1985. His administration applied heterodox policies through the expansion of public expenditure and limitations on debt payments.(Carlos Parodi, Per 1960-2000. CIUP, 2000, pp. 206-208.) With a parliamentary majority for the first time in APRAs history, Garcas administration showed economic promise much as Belandes had. Despite his initial popularity, Garcas term in office was marked by bouts of hyperinflation, which reached 7,649% in 1990 and had a cumulative total of 2,200,200% over his five-year term, profoundly destabilizing the Peruvian economy. As a result of this chronic inflation, the Peruvian currency, the sol, was replaced by the inti in mid-1985, which itself was replaced by the nuevo sol in July 1991; the new currency had an equivalent value of one billion old soles. During Garcas administration, the per capita annual income of Peruvians fell to $720 (below 1960 levels) and Perus GDP dropped by 20%. By the end of his term, national reserves were a negative $900 million.(Carlos Parodi, Per 1960-2000. CIUP, 2000, pp. 204-206.) Garcas term was also characterized by heavy increases in poverty. According to studies by the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the United Nations Development Programme, at the start of his presidency, 41.6% of Peruvians lived in poverty. By 1991, this figure had increased to 55%. Garca also attempted to nationalize the banking and insurance industries. He incurred the wrath of the Monetary Fund and the financial community by unilaterally declaring a limit on debt repayment equal to 10% of the gross national product, thereby isolating Peru from the international financial markets. One of his administrations most glaring failures was a multi-million dollar electric tram project for Lima that was never completed; the supports for the elevated track still stand in many places around the city.Critics of Garcas presidency claim that his many poor decisions while in office created an environment that led to the rise of an authoritarian leader like Fujimori, who came to power in 1990. Fujimori implemented drastic measures that caused inflation to drop from 7,650% in 1990 to 139% in 1991. Faced with opposition to his reform efforts, Fujimori dissolved Congress in the auto-golpe of April 5, 1992. He then revised the constitution; called for new congressional elections, and undertook a process of economic liberalization which put an end to price controls, discarded protectionism, eliminated restrictions on direct investment and privatized most state companies.(John Sheahan, La economa peruana desde 1950. IEP, 2001, p. 207.) The reforms allowed sustained growth, except for a slump after the 1997 Asian financial crisis.(Banco Central de Reserva, Producto bruto interno por sectores productivos 1951 - 2006. http://www.bcrp.gob.pe/bcr/dmdocuments/Estadistica/Cuadros/Anuales/ACuadro_06.xls.) Positive results have begun to appear after 15 years, reflecting an expanding global economy; according to figures provided by the INEI, in 2007 the national product grew by 8.99%, exports grew by over 35% (reaching US$ 27.8 billion), private and public investments accounted for 21% of the GDP (24.4% in 2008), net international reserves (including gold) reached US$ 35.1 billion, state income from taxation increased by 33%, national debt with respect to GNP was reduced from 50% in 2000 to 34% in 2006; finally, the national budget has grown by 50% in the five years before 2007.Since 1990, the Peruvian economy has undergone considerable free market reforms, from legalizing parts of the sector to significant privatization in the mining, electricity and telecommunications industries. Thanks to strong foreign investment and the cooperation between the Fujimori government and the Monetary Fund and Bank, growth was strong in 1994-97 and inflation was brought under control. In 1998, Nios impact on  agriculture, the financial crisis in Asia, and instability in Brazilian markets undercut growth. 1999 was another lean year for Peru, with the aftermath of El Nio and the financial crisis working its way through the economy. Lima did manage to complete negotiations for an Extended Fund Facility with the IMF in June 1999, although it subsequently had to renegotiate the targets. Perus per-capita growth rates have diverged from overall growth rates over the last quarter century. Perus GDP per capita peaked in 1981 and is only now returning to that level. By the end of 2006 the government had enacted measures that allowed the economy to improve by increasing investments, expanding production and exports. Raw materials and agroindustrial products represent the bulk of potential exports. By the end of the decade of 2010, investment is expected to total US$25 billion for mining activities, US$20 billion in energy and petroleum, US$12 billion for commerce, US$8 billion for agricultural industries, and US$5 billion for tourism. Thanks to the discovery of large petroleum and gas reserves, Peru is expected to become an important exporter of hydrocarbons by 2010, after being a net importer for decades.See also* of PeruReferences(

Englebright_Dam
extraEnglebright Dam is a  high variable radius concrete dam on the River in the Sacramento River Basin, located in Yuba and Nevada Counties of California, USA. It was put into service in 1941 by the Army Corp of Engineers.The dam was constructed in 1941 for the primary purpose of trapping sediment derived from anticipated hydraulic mining operations in the Yuba River watershed. Hydraulic mining in the Sierra Nevada was halted in 1884 but resumed on a limited basis until the 1930s during the great depression under the regulation of the California Debris Commission. Although no hydraulic mining in the upper Yuba River watershed resumed after the construction of the dam, the historical mine sites continued to contribute sediment to the river. Today, Lake is used primarily for recreation and hydropower.Englebright Lake is nestled in the scenic Sierra foothills east of Marysville. Constructed for the storage of hydraulic gold mining debris, Englebright Dam is a concrete arch structure. It spans 1,142 feet (348 m) across and is 260 feet (79 m) high. The dam is in the steep Yuba River gorge known as the Narrows, holding back a 9 mile (14 km) long lake with a surface area of 815 acres (3.3 km). The lake is unique in that it offers boat-in camping only.Englebright Reservoir provides water-based recreational benefits to the region and provides  of stored water-right capacity, which is released each year through dam operations to benefit fish downstream. Water is also diverted for regional domestic and agricultural uses. Hydroelectric generation from water stored behind Englebright provides annual energy needs for 50,000 homes.A new flow bypass system was installed in 2006 by the Yuba County Water Agency and Mitchell Engineering so that river flow requirements can be met during shut-downs of the Narrows II Powerhouse at the base of the dam.1 Powerhouse is further downstream and smaller than 2 Powerhouse.Image:USACE Englebright Dam and Lake.jpg|Aerial view of Englebright Dam and Lake on the Yuba RiverImage:EnglebrightDam2006.jpg|Englebright Dam during spring floods.

Deep_Creek_Railroad
The Deep Creek Railroad is a defunct railroad company that constructed and operated a line between Wendover and Gold Hill, Utah, a distance of about 45 miles.  It was constructed in 1917 to serve a mining district in the Gold Hill vicinity and existed for 22 years before succumbing to perennially weak traffic levels. History Beginning in the late 1800s, prospectors began exploring the remote Creek Mountains of far west-central Utah, and a brief gold-mining boom resulted in the establishment of the small town of Gold Hill in 1892.   The towns initial period of prosperity was relatively short-lived, but the promise of a second boom surfaced in the 1910s with the development of copper-mining properties in the Gold HIll area.  The rapid growth in the use of electricity during the period created a strong demand for copper, and nearby mining districts near Nevada and Canyon, Utah were highly successful copper producers; Gold Hills promoters hoped that its mines would fall into the same league.The need for a reliable and inexpensive method of shipping ore from these mines was the impetus for construction of the Deep Creek Railroad.  Supported by a group of investors that included Utah Senator Reed Smoot and the president of the Pacific Railroad, planning for the new railway began in 1916, and it was constructed the following year.  The new line began at the small town of Wendover, on the Utah/Nevada border, where a connection was made with the Western Pacific.  From Wendover, the railroad headed straight south through the salt desert, the right-of-way only 30 feet east of the Nevada state line.  The tangent was broken only by the need to bypass a small hill, causing the railroad to dip into Nevada for approximately one-half mile.  From there, the railroad angled southeast, following the edge of the desert into the Gold Hill area.  The railroads main line terminated in Gold Hill, although a short branch accessed the mines just to the east.The Deep Creek Railroad was rapidly and inexpensively built, with minimal earthworks and a small roster of used equipment.  The railroad owned only two steam locomotives, both of which came second-hand from the and Rio Grande Western Railroad.  A single passenger car and one boxcar completed the roster.  Ore from the mines was carried in freight cars belonging to connecting railroads.  By 1918, the railroad had become a subsidiary of the Western Pacific, which financially supported the line due to the connecting freight traffic it generated.Unfortunately for the new railroad, the mines in the Gold Hill area enjoyed only a short productive life.  Usable copper deposits began to diminish by 1920, and although the railroad also carried tungsten and arsenic produced near Gold Hill, mineral production in the area began declining rapidly about 1925.  This cost the railroad nearly its entire traffic base, and eventually train service was reduced to a single weekly roundtrip, operating each Friday.  Eventually the lack of traffic and prospects inevitably doomed the railroad, and it was finally abandoned in 1939.  Most of the railroads former grade remains visible today.External links* Deep Creek Railroad at UtahRails.net References * Carr, Stephen L. and Robert W. Edwards.  Utah Ghost Rails.

After that, he worked for a couple of years abroad and completed a second bachelor degree in electrical engineering in Lige, Belgium. In 1911 he returned to Italy and created Ing. Nicola Romeo e Co.. The company manufactured machines and equipment for the mining industry. As the company became successful he wanted to expand and acquired a majority of Milan based car manufacturing company A.L.F.A. in 1915. Only three years later, in 1918, the whole company was under Nicola Romeos ownership. A.L.F.A. was renamed to Societ Anonima Italiana Ing. Nicola Romeo. The first car carrying the Romeo badge was the 1921 Torpedo 20/30 HP. The company gained a good reputation but in 1927 came very close to liquidation. These changes forced him to leave in 1928.()In his private life he was married to Portuguese Angelina Valadin and fathered seven children; Maurizio, Edoardo, Nicholas, Elena, Giulietta, Piera and Irene.Nicola Romeo died on 15 August 1938 in his home at Como at the age of 62.Almost seventy years later, with the 130th anniversary of his birth, Naples dedicated a street to the memory of Nicola Romeo, called Via Nicola Romeo.File:Nicola Romeo Script.JPG|thumb|480px|center|Nicola Romeo Scripts Honourable Plate in his birth city, SantAntimo (Naples), Italy.ReferencesRomeoRomeoRomeoRomeoRomeoja:RomeoRomeo

James_Conmee
 footnotes        James Conmee (October 13, 1848 &ndash; July 23, 1913) was an Ontario businessman and political figure.  He represented Algoma West from 1885 to 1902 and Arthur and Rainy River from 1902 to 1904 in the Assembly of Ontario and Bay and Rainy River in the House of Commons from 1904 to 1911 as a Liberal member.(Parliamentarian File from the Library of Parliament)BiographyHe was born in Sydenham Township, West in 1848, the son of Irish immigrants Matthew and Rosanna (OShaughnessey) Conmee.  He trained with a York cavalry regiment near the end of the Civil War. James was underage when he and his brother John sought adventure and joined the US cavalry.() under General Custer(. He served as bugle boy and slept in a bag at Custers feet. He was eventually put in charge of the Indian Scouts and led a group of representatives from 22 Nations. Throughout his life, he kept buckskins for adventures in the wild and was buried in his favourite buckskins.   In 1872, at the age of 22 he moved to Fort William to work at a sawmill on the River. In 1874, he married Emily Florence Cox. From 1876 to 1877, he held the contract to deliver mail between Silver Islet and Pigeon River. He was a contractor involved in laying track for the Pacific Railway in northern Ontario, later working on contracts for the Central Railway, Port Arthur, Duluth & Western Railway and other railways in the region.(LawsuitConmee fought and eventually won a lawsuit launched against him and his partner John McLennan by the Canadian Pacific Railway for defrauding the company on their Michipicoten contract..(() Both parties to the lawsuit hired the best lawyers available.  With the proceeds from winning this case Conmee established a pro-bono law firm which charged nothing to handle cases of defense against invalid charges.  The success and visibility of this case led to his meeting with Sir Laurier and they became best friends and confidants.  Sir Wilfred introduced him on the floor of the House of Commons stating to the many lawyers elected that here is a true lawyer.  Laurier is said to have asked Where did this Conmee come from, and how is it he can come here and teach the lawyers law?() Their friendship and collaboration continued until Conmees death.Political careerIn 1878, he became a tax collector for the Municipality of Shuniah.  In 1879, Conmee was elected to the municipal council for Port Arthur ward and, in 1884, he was elected mayor of Arthur, Ontario.  He established the Port Arthur (Ontario) Telephone Company and was also involved in setting up other utility companies.  He also served as first President of the Ontario Mining Institute..(  Conmee ran unsuccessfully in 1896 for the Nipissing seat in the House of Commons before being elected in 1904.(LegacyIn 1911, Conmee retired from politics due to poor health related to tuberculosis  and kidney afflictions.(Obituary Journal Miner, Prescott, AZ 24 July 1913 P1:C1.) He died in Arizona in 1913 and was buried at Port Arthur..(Conmee wrote the lyrics to a patriotic song, The national flag, with music by Herbert Godfrey..( This song represents one of the first National Anthems of Canada.Mr. Conmee was an adventurer, entrepreneur, social advocate, and inventor. He introduced the first telephone system to the Head of the Lakes (or Lakehead), subsequently known as Fort William and Port Arthur and eventually Thunder Bay when the two cities amalgamated. He understood the potential of hydro electric power long before it became common.  He worked long into the night almost every night in a locked laboratory on various gadgets and inventions including the calculating weighscale.(James Conmee of Port Arthur, Ontario. Automatic Weighing-Scales. US Patent number #407170.  Filing date: Nov 1, 1888. Issue date: Jul 16, 1889.) He purchased Nuns Island near Montreal on sight recognizing the potential of the Lachine Rapids for hydro electricity. He also explicitly requested and was given title to all the waters that fed into the Falls and Rapids in order to protect the potential hydro development.  This extremely valuable asset was sold for a song when he believed that the purchaser could promote and develop hydro power quicker than he could and he did not want to stand in the way.St. Josephs Hospital in Port Arthur (now Thunder Bay) was established on land donated in the backyard of his homestead.  He also provided or arranged all funding for the construction of the hospital.  In a show of respect, the only portion of the hospital funded by the Nuns who ran it at the time is the entrance and plaque which still bears his name as of 2007.  The heritage homestead was destroyed in 1968 to increase parking space  - ironically about the same time as the popular tune about destroying paradise to put up a parking lot.Conmee was able to secure federal funding to support the development of the Port Arthur harbour(() which played an important role in the later development of the citys economy.Conmee Township west of Bay was named after him.()ReferencesExternal links* The Canadian parliamentary companion, 1891 JA Gemmill* * * Conmee Family Pictures

Melaleuca,_Tasmania
FranklinMelaleuca is a remote hamlet in the south-west area of Tasmania, Australia.  Access is only by sea via Port Davey, by air() or by foot. The settlement consists of a couple of buildings and a bird hide where the Parrot can be viewed, and is a major tourist attraction. Melaleuca has a gravel airstrip which is used by small aircraft which service hiking needs and which bring tourists to the remote West Wilderness region of the state.  Two hiking trails meet at Melaleuca: the Davey Track and the Coast Track. There are no shops nor any facilities apart from two walkers huts. Camping is available nearby.From the 1930s until the area gained World Heritage status, Melaleuca had been the location leased for mining ventures.( King, C.D. and Fenton, J.

Rusyn_American
Rusyn Americans (also known as Carpatho-Russian Americans or Ruthenian Americans) are Americans whose ancestors were born in Ruthenia.  Some Rusyn Americans identify as Americans or Americans.HistoryRusyns began immigrating to the United States in the late 1870s and in the 1880s. Upon arrival in the United States, the vast majority of Ruthenians identified with the state that they had left. It is, therefore, impossible to know their exact number. Based on immigration statistics and membership records in religious and secular organizations, it is reasonable to assume that there are about 620,000 Americans who have at least one ancestor of Rusyn background.At the time of the first and largest wave of immigration (1880s to 1914), the Rusyn homeland was located entirely within the Empire. In both parts of Austria-Hungary, the economic situation for Rusyns was the same. Their approximately 1,000 villages were all located in hilly or mountainous terrain from which the inhabitants eked out a subsistence-level existence based on small-scale agriculture, livestock grazing (especially sheep), and seasonal labor on the richer plains of lowland Hungary.Since earning money was the main goal of the immigrants, they settled primarily in the northeast and north central states, in particular the coal mining region around Scranton and Wilkes-Barre in eastern Pennsylvania, and in Pittsburgh and its suburbs in the western part of that state. Other cities and metropolitan areas that attracted Rusyns were New York City and northeastern New Jersey; southern Connecticut; the Binghamton-Endicott-Johnson City triangle in south central New York; Cleveland and Youngstown, Ohio; Gary and Whiting, Indiana; Detroit and Flint, Michigan; and Minneapolis, Minnesota. By 1920, nearly 80 percent of all Rusyns lived in only three states: Pennsylvania (54 percent), New York (13 percent), and New Jersey (12 percent).Like other eastern and southern Europeans, Rusyns  were effectively segregated from the rest of American society because of their low economic status and lack of knowledge of English. This was, however, a relatively short-term phase, since the American-born sons and daughters of the original immigrants had, by the late 1930s and 1940s, assimilated and become absorbed into the American middle class.See also*of Rusyn AmericansReferences*

Beinn_Dubhchraig
 easiest_route  Beinn Dubhchraig (Gaelic: Beinn Dubh-chreig) is a Scottish mountain that is situated eight kilometres west of Crianlarich in the northern part of the Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. Overview The mountain reaches a height of 978 metres and therefore qualifies as a Munro, however it is overshadowed by many higher mountains in the area although it is well seen from the main A82 road in Fillan between Tyndrum and Crianlarich.(The Munros Page 20 (From Strathfillan  Shows whole of its northern flank).) The hills name translates as Mountain of the Black Rock,(The High Mountains of Britain and Ireland Page 318 (Give translation as Mountain of the Black Rock).) this refers to the steep and rocky face on the mountains south west slopes above Loch Oss which offer scrambling routes to the summit.(In the Hills of Breadalbane Page 121 Gives meaning of translation.) Geography and Biology Beinn Dubhchraig stands in a group of mountains which rise around the headwaters of the River Cononish and includes two other Munros (Lui and Oss) and the Corbett Chuirn. The glen of Cononish and the four mountains make up the Ben Lui National Nature Reserve, an area which attracts many biologists who come to study the profusion of mountain plants which grow on the moist rocky cliffs and outcrops. The soil in the reserve is of low acidity and saxifrages grow in abundance. Large herds of deer can be found in the corries around the mountain.(Ben Lui NNR website. Gives info on National Nature Reserve.)The mountain stands in an area that has always been popular for hill walking, even before the advent of the motor car, Tyndrums two railway stations gave easy access to these hills.(100 Best Routes on Scottish Mountains Page 28 (Easy access to hill).) Beinn Dubhchraigs best topographic feature is its northern corrie which forms a large basin between the north and north east ridges, the corrie is drained by the Allt Coire Dubchraig which flows north east to join the River Fillan. At the foot of the northern corrie are remnants of an old Pine wood of Coille Coire Chuilc, part of the former Forest. These northern foothills of the mountain were once heavily mined for lead and there are still prominent scars on the hillside. The Campbell wrecked the mine workings in 1745 as they were then owned by a prominent Jacobite Sir Robert Clifton. The mine workings closed eventually in 1923.(Hamishs Mountain Walk Pages 79 & 80 (Gives info pine forest and lead mining).)Beinn Dubhchraig is linked to the adjacent Munro of Ben Oss, which lies two kilometres to the west, by the Bealach Buidhe which has a height of 779 metres. The ridge down to the bealach is broad and holds a few small lochans within the schist rock hollows. There are corries to both the north and south of the bealach. Coire Garbh to the south holds Loch Oss, a sheet of water measuring roughly 500 metres by 300 metres with a small island located within it. To the north of the bealach is Coire Buidhe which has a very steep headwall which prevents a direct descent from the bealach down to the Cononish valley to the north.(The Munros Pages 20 (Details steepness of Coire Buidhe).) To the east, Beinn Dubhchraig falls to the valley of Gleann Auchreoch, much of these lower eastern slopes were planted with conifers in the early 1970s and have become an obstacle to approaches to the mountain from that direction. Ascents The ascent of Beinn Dubchraig starts from the hamlet of Dalrigh on the A82 at grid reference  and takes the track which crosses the railway and follows the Allt Coire Dubchraig through the wood. The track becomes more muddy and crosses three deer fences by stiles to reach the open mountainside from where it is possible to ascend the northern corrie direct to reach the summit plateau just to the north west of the highest point.(The Munros Almanac Page 19 (Gives Route of Ascent).) Beinn Dubhchraig is often climbed in conjunction with some or all of the mountains around the Cononish valley. The view from the summit gives fine views of the mountains of Breadalbane to the west and the twin Munros of Ben More and Binnein are well seen to the south east.

Laramie_Formation
thumb|190px|Typical exposure of the Laramie Formation in northeastern Colorado. Dinosaur bones have been found in the area.The Laramie Formation is a geologic formation of Cretaceous age, named by King in 1876 for exposures in northeastern Colorado, in the States.(King, C. 1876. Report of the Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel. U.S.Geographical and Geological Survey.)The formation is exposed around the edges of the Basin and ranges from 400500 feet on the western side of the basin and 200300 feet thick on the eastern side. The Laramie conformably overlies the Fox Hills Sandstone and unconformably underlies the Arapahoe Conglomerate. The formation can be divided into a lower unnamed member containing bedded sandstone, clay, and coal and an upper unnamed member composed predominately of 90 to 190 m of drab-colored mudstone, some sandstone, and thin coal beds.(Eldridge, G.H., 1888, On some stratigraphical and structural features of the country about Denver, Colorado: Colorado. Scientific Society Proceedings, v. 3, pt. 1, p. 86 118.)(Shroba, R.R., and Carrara, P.E., 1996, Surficial geologic map of the Rocky Flats environmental technology site and vicinity, Jefferson and Boulder Counties, Colorado: U.S. Geological Survey Miscellaneous Investigations Series Map, I 2526.) Nodular ironstone concretions occur in the mudstones that contain plant remains. The coal and clay were once economically important.( The Laramie Formation was deposited on a coastal plain containing coastal swamp. Some of the material in the sandstones originated from silicic volcanoes far to the west.(Wilson, M. 2002. Petrographic provenance analysis of Kiowa Core sandstone samples, Denver Basin, Colorado. In K.R. Johnson, R.G. Raynolds and M.L. Reynolds (eds), Paleontology and Stratigraphy of Laramide Strata in the Denver Basin, Pt.

Currently on display at the courthouse in Greeley, ColoradoFossil vertebrates from the Laramie Formation were among the first dinosaurs to be discovered in the American West (Carpenter and Young 2003). In 1873, Edward D. Cope accompanied Ferdinand V. Hayden, who was leader of the Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories. The route of the expedition included eastern Colorado where Cope collected specimens in what is now the Laramie Formation along Bijou Creek on the east side of the Denver Basin (Cope, 1874)(Report on the vertebrate paleontology of northern Colorado. Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel. U.S. Geological and Geographical Survey.).Cope named three species of dinosaurs without description: Cinodon arctatus (later changed to Cionodon arctatus), Polyonax mortuarius and Agathaumas milo (later renamed Hadrosaurus occidentalis). These specimens are currently in the American Museum of Natural History. These specimens are very scrappy and the names no longer considered valid. Subsequent discoveries of dinosaurs occur through the formation, and include a nearly complete skull of Triceratops. Non-dinosaur vertebrates also occur (Carpenter 1979) (Vertebrate fauna of the Laramie Formation (Maastrichtian), Weld County, Colorado.

In K.R. Johnson, R.G. Raynolds and M.L. Reynolds (eds), Paleontology and Stratigraphy of Laramide Strata in the Denver Basin, Pt. I., Rocky Mountain Geology 37: 135-163.) The palynomorphs indicate an early Maastrichtian age (68-69 mya), which is supported by magnetostratigraphy.(*Hicks, J.F., Johnson, K.R., Obradovich, J. D., Miggins, D.P., and Tauxe, L. 2003.

Reynolds (eds), Paleontology and Stratigraphy of Laramide Strata in the Denver Basin, Pt. II., Rocky Mountain Geology 38: 1-27.) Magnetostratigraphy also shows that the Laramie Formation becomes progressively younger eastward as deposition followed the regression of the Interior Seaway.Fossil leaves are abundant, especially in the shales and sandstones associated with coal.(Johnson, K. R., Reynolds, M.L., Werth, K.W., and Thomasson, J.R. 2003. Overview of theLate Cretaceous, early Paleocene, and early Eocene megafloras of the Denver Basin, Colorado. In K.R. Johnson, R.G.

Dicot angiosperms dominate, with lesser amounts of ferns, palms, and herbaceous lycopods. Interestingly, conifers are rare. Common plants include Ficus planicostata, Myrica torreyi, Sabalites sp., Platanites marginata, and Marmarthia pearsonii.UraniumUranium deposits occur in sandstones of the Laramie Formation in County, Colorado.

Wilgie_Mia
Wilgie Mia is an ochre mine in the Weld Range of Australia.  Excavations have occurred for at least 40,000 years and  of material has been removed, leading to suggestions that this is the worlds oldest continuing mining operation. It is located in a hillside of the Weld Range, near the northwest town of Cue. Worked to a depth of 20 metres, scaffolds had lined the seam face beyond an opening 30 metres across. Archaeological excavations have recovered tools and equipment used in the exploitation of the resource, detailed analysis of the ochre reveals an extensive use throughout Western Australia. The mine continues to export ochre as a commercial pigment.Ochre has been an important commodity in the history of Australia and the site produced large amounts of both red and yellow pigments. A range of colours and high durability are found in the constituent clays of the ochre mined at Wilgie Mia.  These are residual to a geological process involving haematite (Fe2O3) and other iron rich compounds. Wilgie Mia ochre has been used in the production of art and other painting practices throughout many regions of Australia.  It had important cultural significance to many surrounding communities until the final dispersal of the local group by colonial miners in the 1930s.Wilgie Mia was added to the National Heritage List in 2011.

John_William_Stokes
John William Stokes, also known as Jack Stokes (1 February 1910  3 August 1995) was an Australian administrator in the Territory Police, and on the Territories of the (Keeling) Islands and of Island.His maternal grandparents were from Stolp, Pomerania, now within Poland, and after moving to Australia in the 1870s they became farmers at Burnt Creek, Victoria. His paternal grandfather was from North Carolina, USA, and died for the Confederates in the American Civil War. Upon his death, Stokes father went to sea at the age of 14 due to the destitution at home. He eventually joined the Calcutta Police Force in India and came to Victoria in the 1870s when his first wifes health deteriorated. There were no children. After her death in 1894, his father, then one of the first plain clothes detectives in the Victorian Police Force, married his first wifes nurse in 1895. They had six children, the youngest being Jack Stokes. Jack left school in 1924 at the age of 14 after the death of his father and joined the Railways as a boy labourer. Later, realising that there was no future in the position, he studied at night to become a clerical officer and during the Great Depression, accepted a transfer to the Victorian Taxation Department. There he languished in boredom until a fortuitous glance at a recruitment advertisement for police in the Northern Territory changed his life.On 31 December 1936 he joined the Northern Territory Police, caught a ship to Darwin and over the next 20 years rose to be Administrative Inspector and Acting Superintendent. On arrival in Darwin on 8 January 1937, he learned that training was acquired on the job. He began patrolling the streets the next day. The work included several patrols into outback areas, and in September 1937 he was sent for a year to Island, off Land, to deter Japanese pearlers from prostituting Aboriginal women.At Elcho and elsewhere as the lone policeman in an extensive remote area, he travelled widely with the Aboriginals observing their country and culture, helping to resolve disputes and administering first aid. Journalist Colin Bednall, who visited Elcho on the monthly supply vessel, described Stokes camp as a veritable wonder-home, with gardens and sheds around the main tent. An airstrip was cleared with Aboriginal labour. His final report on departure was commended for its fairness and honesty by the Chief Protector of Aborigines and years later he was remembered affectionately by locals. Six months after leaving Elcho, it was discovered that Stokes had broken his spine in an accident before going to Elcho and now, after working for two years without knowing it, the spine was collapsing. He was sent to Melbourne where 7 inches were taken off the tibia of his left leg and five vertebrae fused together. He recuperated in bed for four months before returning to work in Darwin.  At the outbreak of World War Two in September 1939, Stokes applied for leave to join the Army but was refused because his police work was considered an essential service. During the war he was in charge of the police district centred on Maranboy, south of Katherine, which was then a tin mining camp. He married Edna on 31 January 1940 and she became a vital unpaid contributor to the smooth operation of each of the police stations to which they were posted. Later, in retirement, he described his time in the Territory as the most fulfilling part of his career. Reflecting on a brief return by Stokes to the Territory in 1977, Darwin journalist Alan Wauchope described him as the kindest and gentlest policeman of them all. Under Commonwealth Cabinet Decision 1573 of 9 September 1958, he was appointed the second Official Representative (now Administrator) of the Australian Government on the remote Indian Ocean Territory of the (Keeling) Islands. The Island were acquired in 1957 from the United Kingdom prior to the independence of Singapore-Malaysia. He officially assumed the position on 8 November and arrived on the Islands on 15 November after briefings in Canberra and Perth. He served until 27 July 1960 when he left on leave. On 3 August 1960 his appointment was officially terminated by the Minister for Territories, Hasluck, effective from 30 September 1960, and was appointed from the next day the second Official Representative of Island. Both communities were small, isolated and multicultural and required considerable sensitivity and understanding in their administration. On his departure from Christmas Island in May 1966 he was lauded for these qualities by all sectors, organisations and clubs of the Island. For example, the leader of the Cocos Malay Kampong, Mr Bytol bin Zanley, said in a speech at a at farewell function that he would be remembered as ... a good friend and administrator for all he has done for the good of the people and of the community; and the President of the Chinese Literary Association at a similar function said that, the credit for the happy state of affairs in the Territory where the communities live in harmony goes to Mr Stokes, who, has served the peoples well by his meritorious services and administration. He has achieved much in the fields of welfare and education...(treating)...all people alike, both young and old, poor and rich. He has been most kind to them.In June 1966, he assumed a position with the Department of Territories in Canberra and, on retirement in 1970, was made a of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) by Queen Elizabeth for distinguished public service.  He died on 3 August 1995, aged 85, and his wife on 12 April 2009, aged 95. They are survived by six children, 24 grandchildren and an increasing number of their children.References*	The Long Arm - Biography of a Northern Territory Policeman 1937-1942, Hugh V.

Hart,_California
footnotes                 thumb|right|320px|View of Hart in 1908, looking northwestthumb|right|320px|The Northern Club, downtown Hart in 1908 Hart was a short-lived gold mining town located in the desert, in San Bernardino County, California, States. It existed between 1908 and 1915, and was located on the northeastern edge of Valley near the York Mountains. The area is now in the National Preserve, directed by the Park Service.HistoryIn late 1907, while a depression was sweeping the nation, three prospectors from Goldfield - James Hart and the brothers Bert and Clark Hitt - found pockets of rich gold ore in the Castle Mountains, about four miles south of the & Searchlight Railroad.The strike was touted as the Second Goldfield bonanza.  In early 1908, prospectors swarmed to the strike in automobiles and wagons, on bicycles and burros. During the next few months, 700 people arrived, a camp was thrown up, a telephone line was strung to Barnwell, a weekly newspaper, the Enterprise, started up, a voting precinct and justice-court township were created, and a office were established.By summer, Harts peak of 1,500 residents were served by the Norton House and Martin House Hotels, and a house (flophouse) called the Star.  Other businesses included two general stores, (including the Hart-Gosney), the Ames Book and Cigar Store, a real-estate office, a candy store, two lumberyards, a bakery, eight saloons (including Hart and Hitt, C. Aguire, Arlington Club, Honest John, Oro Belle, and Northern Bar), and a house of prostitution.  There were telephone and telegraph services, and a water line.  A miners union was organized.  A businessmens league limited the sale of liquor, enforced police and fire regulations, and ousted gamblers and toughs. Hart and Hitts original claim was sold by their promoter, Will Foster, to the Oro Belle Mining Company of Minnesota in 1908 for $100,000.  The mine was never profitable and shut down for good in 1918.(Snorf, D.N., Early Days at Hart; Being the Reminiscenses of John Sherwood Snorf as told to Dorothy (Nelson) Snorf, 1991, Tales of the Mojave Road Publishing Company, Goffs Schoolhouse, Essex, CA; 208 pp. Illustrated. )All the other mines had the same fate.  The pockets of high-grade ore proved too small, and mining declined as soon as 1909.  The largest mine besides the Oro Belle was the Big Chief, originally called the Jumbo, also owned by the Hart brothers.  A 10 mill was built at this mine.  Other mines included the Twin Peaks, the Flyer, the Florence, the Zinc-Graf property, and the Todd Hunter lease.(The Enterprise and other businesses closed; a fire wiped out much of the district (largely deserted); the leading mines suspended work and the miners union was disbanded; the court district and voting precinct were abolished; and, finally, the post office closed in late 1915.See also*Road*National PreserveReferencesSources* * External links* Hensher 2005* Desert Fever (1981)* http://www.robertwynn.com/Hart.htm

Providence,_San_Bernardino_County,_California
Providence was a short-lived silver mining town located in San Bernardino County, California, States. It existed between 1880 and 1886.LocationThe town of Providence was located on the east slope of the Mountains. The site is just north of the Providence Mountain State Recreation Area.HistoryParties of prospectors from Ivanpah found rich silver ore along the steep slopes of the Providence Mountains in the spring of 1880. The richest property turned out to be the Bonanza King, which was soon sold to a pair of sharpsWilson Waddingham and Thomas Ewingwho had just bilked investors in a mining-stock scheme in Colorado.Working 150 men, the two rapidly opened up the Bonanza King and put up a 20-stamp mill. A post office was established in mid-1882. Since Providence was basically a company camp, its business district remained limited to 2 general stores and 3 saloons. By then, the mine had produced $1.5 million in bullion.For reasons that remain unclear, Waddingham and Ewing began to lay off workers. The mill burned in mid-1885. A 5-stamp mill was built at the nearby Perseverance Mine in 1886, but the price of silver continued to slip, and the post office closed in 1892.The district enjoyed several important revivals. One company built a gasoline-powered 10-stamp mill just below the Bonanza King during 1906-1907. And during World War I, an Eastern company rebuilt the mill, put up a camp supplied with electricity and running water, and reopened the mine. Smaller revivals followed during the 1920s.References* * External links* Providence-Alan Hensher 2005* Desert Fever (1981)* Providence-notes* MojaveDesert.net* Providence from the Digital-Desert

Max_Michaelis
Image:Max Michaelis00.jpg|thumb|Max Michaelis by Singer SargentImage:Lady Michaelis00.jpg|thumb|Lady Michaelis by Singer SargentSir Maximilian Michaelis (11 May 1852 Eisfeld, Germany - 26 January 1932, Zurich) was a South African financier, mining magnate, benefactor and patron of the arts. Michaelis received his early schooling in Nuremberg where he is said to have developed his love of old masters. His first arrival in South Africa dates back to 1876 when he landed at Elizabeth. Two years later he had moved to Kimberley, drawn by the 1871 discovery of diamonds and the prospect of wealth. Here he became a close business associate of Wernher and Beit and got to know Eckstein and J.B. Taylor - friendships that were to last a lifetime. He was co-opted by Wernher to deal in diamonds for Porges and Wernher, and in the 1880s restructured the Cape Diamond Company. He was a founding partner of Wernher, Beit & Co. Within some years he had become manager of the Central Mining and Investment Corporation in Johannesburg. From 1896 he worked at the Corporations offices in London and remained there until 1919, when he returned to South Africa. In England he led an extremely secluded life on the country estate, Tandridge Court in Surrey. Unlike the other Randlords, he was not given to lavish entertaining and spending, avoided the press, did not have an opulent London mansion and despite desiring a baronetcy, was not socially ambitious. With the outbreak of World War I and the anti-German hysteria that gripped England, Michaelis acted on a suggestion by Smuts that he return to South Africa.Max Michaelis and his wife arrived in Cape Town in 1919. In December of that year a grand civic reception for 2 000 guests was given in his honour. In 1913 he had presented a collection of Dutch and Flemish old masters to the Union government, a gift leading to his being knighted. These formed the basis of the Michaelis Collection and were housed in the Old Town House in Cape Town. The decision to house the collection in Cape Town, came in for a great deal of criticism - public sentiment at the time was that the money had originated from the Reef gold mines and that the collection belonged in Johannesburg. Besides, a lot of the works were regarded as being of indifferent quality (Portrait of a Woman by Hals being the cynosure of the collection) and there was at least one painting of questionable attribution. These works had been collected by Phillips (wife of Sir Phillips, Bt) and Sir Lane. In June 1920 at the urging of Lady Phillips, he endowed the chair of Fine Art at the of Cape Town and in return was rewarded with an honorary LL.D. He also donated a large number of art works to museums in Kimberley and Johannesburg.(http://www.joburg.org.za/2004/march/mar2_art.stm) In 1924 a knighthood was conferred on Max Michaelis. He died of cancer in Zurich in 1932.Image:Michaeliscollection.jpg|thumb|The Old Town House where the Michaelis Collection is exhibited. Town, 2008Lady Michaelis, who returned to England on the death of Max Michaelis, presented large collections of art to the National Art Gallery in Cape Town and to Pretoria, with further gifts to the Michaelis Collection in Cape Town. She was also the founder of the Lady Michaelis Orthopaedic Home in Cape Town. Moses Kottler created a bronze bust of Sir Max, which was placed in the garden of the Old Town House in Cape Town.In 1920 Max Michaelis acquired the Montebello estate in Newlands. Before his death in 1996, his son Cecil Michaelis, the artist, resenting government expropriation of the estate, donated Montebello to the University of Cape Town on condition the estate was used to promote design - this is now known as the Montebello Design Centre and the old residence as Michaelis House, the junior boarding house of the African College Schools.Montebello Design CentreMontebello is a Section 21 Non Profit Company. It is a busy craft and design centre, visitors love it, studios have a sense of ownership over it, people talk under the camphor trees, attend classes, make products - it has survived 16 years.Our vision is to create design solutions for Africa, while recognizing that the goal of design is to enhance the value of life-respecting	Cultural and social diversity-despite globalisation	Bio-diversity-enhancing global sustainability and environmental protection	Intellectual diversity-across different knowledge systems.Our long- term goal is to create a centre that is:	For Africa-seeking creative strategies and solutions to enhance the quality of life in Africa	From Africa-looking to the wealth of indigenous design ingenuity in Africa, as a limitless resource to create contemporary design for an African and global market.At present the first stage of this long term vision is in place with a craft centre housing   production studios, shops, teaching and research, a nursery, a restaurant and an organic deli/cafe.   The aim of the project in its first phase is to promote good local craft and design and use craft for job creation.With the exception of some outreach projects the activities of Montebello Design Centre happen on site at the centre in Newlands. The centres staff and studio occupants conduct the activities. The Montebello shops are open 7 days a week. The restaurant, nursery and organic deli are open 6 days a week.  The studios are open (with varying hours) from Monday to Saturday.  The public are free to browse informally. Classes happen every weekday both during the day and in the evening. Special interest tours can be arranged at any time, and many schools participate. The greatest resource of the centre is the prime land and historic buildings the project occupies and has the use of. These were donated to the University of Cape Town for the purposes of the project. They provide an enabling environment with which creative people can work and craft and design can be promoted. The other great resource of the centre is the human resource of people within the studios. They represent a considerable skills bank of creativity, design and craft skills, which the centre is able to use to further its objectives by encouraging and facilitating:	apprenticeship teaching and training,	outreach programmes	marketing and promotion of quality craft  Amongst the projects currently at Montebello are:The Montebello Shop A well-stocked general craft shop that supports good local craft with a special interest in products made from waste materials and weeds. These include items made from glass, fabric, metal, paper and alien vegetation, some so ingeniously well made that their origin as waste is not always apparent.  It promotes good local craft and design and use craft for job creation, cultural and social diversity, sustainability and environmental protectionThe Montebello Craft Shops objective is to provide market linkages for many township and rural craft projects and individuals. It aims to break even on its administrative and staff costs and profits put back into expanding craft and design marketing opportunities to more projects and individuals.Mielie Shop and WorkshopA job creation project for township women, that designs and manufactures off-beat handbags, accessories and home-ware products from recycled materials. All their products are made by hand and do not require expensive machinery, thereby creating as many jobs as possible. They use traditional techniques-such as crochet, knotting, beading and hooked rugging, often in new and unconventional ways.   This project also promotes good local craft and design and use craft for job creation./ sustainability and environmental protection.   Kunye A job creation project for township and rural people that designs and makes funky homeware and accessories handmade from recycled, found materials as well as sustainably harvested materials.   Due to space requirements this project does not work at Montebello at present but their stock is sold in the Montebello shop.Alien Vegetation Project This project makes garden furniture and fencing from an alien invasive wattle called Port Jackson, which depletes the water table in the Western Cape. The Department of Water Affairs has an ongoing campaign to eradicate Port Jackson, and Montebello has also been involved in assisting their secondary industries programme, with other job creation projects using alien vegetation.Right MukoreRight creates unique wooden and stone sculptural works of art.  Right comes from Shoshe in the Masingo province of Zimbabwe.  He first developed an interest in art at the age of 13 and in 1994 enrolled in the school of art at Konimara.  Right has been practicing his art for 20 years and is now working at Montebello.  He creates unique pieces.  He had an uncanny ability to see into the heart of a branch or trunk and see a personality inside.  Come and see for yourself how he brings the personality to life.  Beloved BeadworkBeloved Beadwork produces intricate, beautiful pieces of wearable beadwork using complex weaving techniques and high quality glass.   Launched in May 2009, Beloved Beadwork makes and sells the designs of Anna Richerby, a beadworker and Anthropology graduate from the UK. The team comprises a socially diverse group of expert beadworkers who work from home.  They use unusual stitches, intricate colour schemes, and glass and thread sourced from Japan, the Czech Republic, India and the USA. Their aim is to push the boundaries of the beadwork tradition in Cape Town, and to produce distinct, original pieces of work which can be considered wearable art. Their interest also lies in contributing to a transformed and ethical craft sector which develops good creative skills and enables a high quality of life for all its members.Sitali Jewellers Sitali specializes in custom designed jewellery with precious metals and stones. It is also a pilot site for the UCT /Cape Tech/Mintek Hot Platinum jewellery alloy design initiative. The opportunities for beneficiation of raw materials have traditionally not been taken advantage of in South Africa. This is especially true in areas such as the jewellery industry, where value adding precious metals and stones, has great potential for wealth creation. This is a wasteful situation and one that the project aims to redress. Another project within Sitali is developing a range of wood and gold jewellery with a group of bushman from the Northern Cape.The Fragile Cultures Music ProjectThis is an audio visual research and outreach project engaged in recording the musical heritage of Southern Africa.A and C MapsThis studio produces maps for the Cape Towns crafts and design routes as well as numerous other maps promoting regional heritage and culture. Product Programme This is a craft outreach programme assisting township and rural crafters with product development , business skills and market linkages. Within the South African context craft is one of the few ways in which people lacking adequate formal education opportunities can earn at least a partial living. Until recently no notice was taken of the craft sector, which revealed itself in the last census as being the third largest employer of people (after the public sector and agriculture).Ikwezi Art CentreEstablished last year the centre offers an opportunity for township artists to interact with the public.   It sells original township art and artists work on site.There are also other studios most of which offer tuition and training or apprenticeship:- Brenda Parker Jeweller - The Forge (original hand forged items)- Weave (hand woven textiles)-  Louise Gelderblom Ceramics- Nienkes Ceramics- Alma Vorster (etching, monoprint, linocuts)- African Ethos (African musical instruments)- Lesley Charnock (artist)- David Krut Publishers (art books etc)- Beloved Beadwork (high quality beautiful beadwork)- Right Mukore (stone & wood sculptures)NotesExternal links*Montebello Design CentreGalleryImage:Old Town House00.jpg|Old Town House, Cape Town in 1878Image:Portrait_of_a_Woman00.jpg|Portrait of a Womanby HalsImage:Lady Michaelis01.jpg|Lady Michaelis by Edward Roworth

On April 6, 2007 the coalitions members count was reduced to 238 members:()()* of Regions (186)* Party of Ukraine (31)* Party of Ukraine (21)Fall of cabinetof Ukraine Yushchenko dissolved parliament on 2 April 2007 because he believed the government was acting illegally  during the Ukrainian political crisis. Yushchenko argued that the constitution only allows whole parliamentary blocs to change sides, not individuals deputies. Yushchenko, Yanukovych and parliamentary speaker Moroz agreed in late May 2007 that the election would be held on 30 September, provided that at least 150 opposition and pro-president MPs formally gave up their seats, thereby creating the legal grounds for dissolving parliament.

Sir_Robert_McAlpine_Ltd
  homepage        www.sir-robert-mcalpine.comSir Robert McAlpine Ltd. is a private British company headquartered in London. It carries out engineering and construction for the oil and gas, petrochemical, power generation, nuclear, pharmaceutical, defence, chemical, water and mining industries.HistoryThe company was founded in 1869 by Sir Robert McAlpine, who was known as Concrete Bob. In 1935, Sir Roberts son Alfred established a separate construction company, Alfred McAlpine plc, that operated in the north west of England while Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd. operated in the rest of the United Kingdom.The company constructed the Hotel on Park Lane in London. When the client was unable to pay for the construction works, the company took possession of the completed building and operated it on its own account.()From the 1930s onwards, the company employed large numbers of Irish who had come to England looking for work. The harsh working conditions with which McAlpines management treated their labourers has gone down in Irish emigrant folklore. The song Fusiliers (written by Behan and made famous by The Dubliners) described the realities of life on the building site for many expatriates.()In 2003, Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd. sued Alfred McAlpine plc over the use of the family name and won.() The dispute centred around Alfred McAlpines intention to trade under the name McAlpine. There was previously a long standing agreement within the McAlpine family not to make such a change but, following the death of Alfred McAlpine, the board of Alfred McAlpine sought to make the change in any event. The effect of the judgment was to prevent Alfred McAlpine trading under the name McAlpine. In 2008, Alfred McAlpine plc was acquired by Carillion and dismantled, thus making the name war irrelevant.File:Emirates Stadium - East side - Composite.jpg|thumb|right|240px|the Stadium built by Sir Robert McAlpineStructureThe company is organised on a regional basis.()It has offices in Hemel Hempstead, London, Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Newcastle, Leeds, Edinburgh and Glasgow.

Civilization_IV:_Beyond_the_Sword
 version  3.19 (June 10, 2009)Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword is the second official pack of the strategy game IV.() The expansion focuses on adding content to the in-game time periods following the invention of gunpowder, and includes more general content such as 11 new scenarios, 10 new civilizations, and 16 new leaders.()()FeaturesOverview*Corporations: A new gameplay feature, similar to the religion feature, allows players to create corporations and spread them throughout the world. Each corporation provides benefits in exchange for certain resources.*Espionage: Now available much earlier in the game, this expanded feature offers players many new ways to spy on opponents, stir citizen unrest and defend their governments secrets.*Random Events: New random events such as natural disasters, pleas for help, or demands from their citizens will challenge players to overcome obstacles in order for their civilizations to prosper. Random events can also be beneficial, such as scientific breakthroughs or incidents that improve relations with a neighbor.*Advanced Starts: When starting the game in any era, this new option allows the player to purchase components for an already-developed nation.*Expanded Space Victory: Obtaining a space victory is now more difficult and requires more strategy and decision-making than before.*Expanded Diplomatic Victory: It is now possible to achieve diplomatic victories much earlier in the game, and to defy resolutions.*New Game Options: Beyond the Sword offers various new game options, like new world-types and the option to play any leader-civilization combination.CorporationsCorporations become available with discovery of the Corporation technology. Each of the seven available Corporations requires a particular type of Great Person, a particular additional technology, and access to particular resources to build the Corporate Headquarters and found that Corporation; each of the seven Corporations can be founded only once per game. Each Corporation consumes specific resources, and supplies alternative resources or benefits in return. The more instances of resources they consume, the more food, production, commerce, or resources they supply. Corporations can be spread like religions (using the Executive unit as a missionary) to other cities, including foreign cities; any city hosting a Corporation branch must pay a maintenance fee for its services, while the owner of the Corporate Headquarters receives bonus gold for each branch.Players can block foreign corporations from operating in their cities by adopting the Mercantilism civic, and they can block all corporations, even their own, by adopting the State Property civic.Currently, the following seven Corporations appear in the game. Unlike Religions, the Corporations are not directly based on real-life corporations, but some of the options are clear references to real companies such as Mills or Oil:*Standard Ethanol Company() offers the player, after the use of a Great Scientist to build its headquarters,() the possibility to provide oil in exchange for corn, sugar, or rice.*Cereal Mills(() provides additional food for a city in the form of cereal, in exchange for corn, rice, or wheat. The player can build its headquarters with a Great Merchant.(*Creative Constructions() provides extra production and culture in exchange for obsolete strategic resources like iron, copper, stone, or marble. A Great Engineer can create a Creative Constructions headquarters.()*Aluminum, Co.( provides Aluminum in exchange for Coal. Its headquarters can be created with a Great Scientist.(*Civilized Jewelers requires the Mass Media tech ( and needs a Great Artist to create its headquarters. The corporation consumes gold, silver or gems to generate treasury income and culture.(*Mining Inc. corporations headquarters can be built with a Great Engineer.() It consumes Coal, Iron, Copper, Gold or Silver and increases a citys production.*Sids Sushi Co. requires the discovering of the Medicine tech( and the use of a Great Merchant to build its headquarters. This corporation uses Fish, Crabs, Clam or Rice to provide extra food and culture to cities. This corporation is named for Meier,( creator of the Civilization series.EspionageEspionages importance in Civilization IV has been raised to compare with that of scientific research, culture, income from taxes etc. The new espionage slider allows the player to divert part of their income towards espionage activities against other civilizations. Once the player has reached certain thresholds of espionage investment, the player starts gaining some automatic intelligence benefits over rival civilizations.The player can also send Spy units into foreign territory to gather further intelligence and to perform various missions of destruction and propaganda. Their role is a bit different, because spies are now invisible to all units, save for other spies.() Great Spies are born in cities, like other Great Persons. Great Spies can perform typical functions like serving as a Specialist, starting a Golden Age, or building a unique building. Their special function allows them to infiltrate enemy cities, giving the player significant advantage in espionage against that civilization. Just like other Great Persons, they have unique names, and their appearance changes accordingly to the time period, e.g., a Great Spy in the ancient era shows up as a ninja, just as the Industrial-Age Great Spy appears as a tuxedo-sporting Bond-style unit, complete with similar thematic music once a mission is performed.()Conversely, espionage has become somewhat of a hindrance in the pursuit of normal diplomatic victories.  The act of catching opposing AI controlled spies will devastate your diplomatic relations with those players forcing you into a negative relationship that you cannot recover from.  Even a friendly AI could potentially have a hidden -10 points from captured spies that will never allow a diplomatic victory, even through rampant generosity of resources, technology, gold, and all other attempts to negate the immense negative statistic.  (This can be tested by saving an in-progress player vs CPU game and continuing it with players in place of the AI.)Random eventsThe Beyond the Sword expansion reintroduces City- and Alpha Centauri-style random events from the original Civilization game, which can cause the game to swing in the players favor or present another obstacle the player must overcome. There are more than a hundred of these events, including natural disasters, such as earthquakes that can destroy buildings, and diplomatic marriages that might suddenly turn two former rivals into friends. Together these new events give each game a completely unique flavor.() In addition, each game offers players the opportunity for rewards through the completion of special events in the form of missions (quests).()Some examples of Random Events in the game include:*Tsunamis()*Floods(*Discovery of new resources(*Earthquakes()*Diplomatic marriages(*Plea of help from another civilization(*Unexpected demands from citizens(*Hurricanes*warming*Triangle accidentsAdvanced startsAdvanced Starts are a pre-game setup phase players use to purchase cities, improvements, buildings, technologies, and units. It works in both single-player and multi-player. The player decides what to purchase and where to place it. When everyone is done, the game starts with players controlling relatively balanced, advanced empires with a working infrastructure. This mechanism is ideal for those who want to jump right in and experience a balanced game in a further era, without having to start it from the stone age.Expanded Space VictoryTo acquire a Space Victory, the game now requires the players spaceship to reach Centauri, rather than simply launch. It is now also possible to build spaceships that fly faster than those of other civilizations, so that a player can achieve Space Victory, even if they finished building a spaceship after a competitor.Expanded Diplomatic VictoryThe new Palace wonder allows the player to win an early diplomatic victory, centuries before the United Nations is due to make its appearance. The wonder is tied to the state religion of the player who built it. Depending on the influence of the Palaces religion on their civilization, players get votes to cast on decrees like holy wars, trade embargoes, or peace enforcement. It is later rebuffed by Communism and made obsolete by Media. At this point, the more modern Nations takes over many of its functions.()New game optionsThe expansion offers various new world-types and game options. The player will have the option to play as any leader-civilization combination, therefore allowing what-if possibilities. Also, a new feature is the option to only trade away player researched technologies. Finally players can choose the religions founded by specific technologies, so that the same religions will not be dominant in every game.()New contentImage:Duomo Firenze.jpg|thumb|The title screen depicts the Cathedral, but it is not visible in the game.New content includes:*10 new civilizations and leaders (Babylonia, Empire, Empire, Roman Empire, Empire, the Mayans, Native Americans, Netherlands, Portugal and Sumer)*6 new leaders for existing civilizations (Abe Lincoln, de Gaulle, Boudica, I, the Magnificent and Pericles).*25 new units, 18 buildings and new technologies added primarily to the late game.(*11 new scenarios.(*6 new Wonders of the World.*New diplomatic resolutions through the Nations.General changes*Improvements in AI (Artificial Intelligence) for harder games across all difficulty levels. The AI player will attempt more ways to win than before. It is also better at warfare (particularly naval operations) and economic management.()*Early-game units now have different regional art styles and motifs.*Colonies can split off from their motherland to form new civilizations()*The foreign advisory screen has been overhauled.(*Beyond the Sword includes some material from the previous Warlords expansion pack, specifically the core game features, but not the Warlords scenarios.(New scenariosThe expansion delivered 11 new scenarios. Some were developed by the fan community,( and were critically well received.() The following scenarios are included.(()()()()*AfterworldThis single player scenario was designed by Firaxis Tim McCracken featuring a fiction/Horror/Playing Game theme where a team of Gravebringers are sent to a world inhabited by human robots to retrieve research. In this squad based tactical scenario the player must fight against zombies and the undead. This scenario is also unusual in that it does not contain many aspects of Civilization IV like leaders, cities or technologies.(()*Broken StarRussia is divided, and a civil war is coming. To unite the Motherland the player may purchase military units from the U.S. or promotion upgrades from the Chinese black market; conscript the Russian people or bribe enemy forces; or even deploy the ultimate doomsday weaponry: the bomb.(Some nations include:* Coalition General* Rebels*Charlemagnes WarsThis scenario is based on the wars fought by Frankish king and later emperor Charlemagne in Europe during the late eighth and early ninth centuries. The scenario introduces a bevy of Medieval units such as the Mounted Infantry and the Supply Train. Players gain favor from Rome by spreading Christianity and destroying Islam. When a player gains enough favor he/she may be rewarded with the powerful Papal Pikeman. ()Some leaders and nations featured include:*Burgundy, led by Gundobad*Aquitaine, led by of Aquitaine*Charlemagne*CIV DefenseIn CIV Defense, Civilization IV becomes a single player defense in which players start with a small amount of cash to buy an advanced start and to get a single city going before the game starts. The player is confronted with 20 waves of enemies who try to capture their cities. Between each wave of attacks, the player receives gold for each city that survives, using it to acquire new units, cities and technologies.(*Crossroads of the World!A late medieval age scenario where the player carves out a fortune from the riches of fourteenth-century Africa, Arabia, and Persia. Victory is achieved by trading, betraying, and battling ones way towards control of the Crossroads of the World.(*Fall from Heaven: Age of IceA plot-heavy fantasy scenario set in the world of Erebus, home of the popular Fall from Heaven public mod() and made in cooperation with Firaxis staff and members of the mod team.The scenario begins 350 years into the Age of Ice. Mulcarn, the God of Winter, reigns and the world is little more than a frozen wasteland ravaged by blizzards. Mankind has lost the knowledge gained during the previous age and has broken into small tribes fighting for survival. The player controls Kylorin, an ageless hero, who needs to recover the pieces of the legendary sword The Godslayer, and defeat Mulcarn with it.*Final FrontierThe Final Frontier space scenario adapts Civilization into space with a brand new tech tree, units and terrain. The sides are different extrasolar colonies that have now lost contact with Earth. Over the course of the scenario, clues about what happened to humanitys home planet are revealed. The focus is not on building cities, but colonizing entire star systems.()*Gods of OldGods of Old is the standard game, based on principles of religion. Each of the seven ancient Sumerian gods in the game has a special ability and can unleash calamities such as earthquakes and floods.(*Next WarA futuristic sci-fi scenario with clone armies and mechanized units set in the 2050s. This scenario is available as an expansion on the Epic game as well as being a standalone scenario.The World is divided into four huge empires: The Pan-Asiatic People Co-Operative-led by the Glorious Leader, Shi Huang (China, Japan, Siam and East Russia), America Inc.-led by Mr. Big, Washington (North America, Britain, New Zealand and Australia), The Great Southern Empire-led by The Lady, Hatshepsut (Africa, Middle East and South America) and Europa-led by His Excellency the Great (Europe, Algeria, Turkey and West Russia). You can also build Biological Bombs to destroy other empires and Nuclear bombs to do even more damage.(()*and Fall of CivilizationNearly all standard civilizations available in Beyond the Sword are made available to play in their proper geographic and historical locations.  Features such as dynamic historical city names, unique historical victories, and the new stability system enhance both the historical feel and the game play.  Scripting of the AI encourages the world to develop in a similar path to real history, yet with an element of unpredictability to keep the game fresh.(*World War II: Road to WarPlay as the Allies or Axis in the Theater starting in either 1936 or 1939 or the Pacific Theater starting in 1936 of the World War. Some of the countries playable are Germany (Vice Chancellor Von Papen), Japan (Admiral Yamamoto), The United States (President Roosevelt), France (De Gaulle), Great Britain (Churchill), and the USSR (Stalin).(()ModdingIn general, with the exception of Final Frontier, the external mods (official mods originally made by users, instead of by Firaxis) had the best reception: Rounding out BtS is a selection of mods and scenarios. Some are the best of the mod scene, others Firaxis designs. Sadly for Firaxis, its the already existing mods that shine - the excellent fantasy-set Fall from Heaven, the intriguing, history-following Rhyes and Fall of Civilizations, and WWII: The Road to War.()For example, and Fall of Civilization was called one of the most exciting and robust mods youll ever see for any game in Yahoo! Games review,() and a fresh new coat of paint to the core Civilization gameplay in the Gamespot one.() French magazine Cyberstratge reckoned it the best of the scenarios released in Beyond the Sword, assigning the best mark (9 of out 10) among them.()  Whereas the standard, epic game takes historical civilizations from different eras and locations on the planet and starts them each in 4000 BC on a random map, Rhyes and Fall of Civilization puts the civilizations into their proper time and place in human history.  The mod is also notable for the addition of features meant to enhance the historical feel of the game such as a stability system (civs truly can rise and fall), plagues, historical place names, and scripted AI behavior that mirrors real Earth history. An added victory condition, the Historical Victory is also added. This victory requires the player to meet certain conditions that are unique to each civilization, for example the Americans must not allow European cities in North America by a 1900 and Arabia must spread Islam to 40% of the world in order to win.()Another notable Beyond the Sword mod Fall From Heaven II was created by the fan-team who were involved in developing the scenario Age of Ice. It is set in a dark fantasy world directly after the scenario, at the end of an ice age and the rebirth of civilization. FfH rebalances the game to emphasize warfare with small, enduring groups instead of human waves; adds a magic system with caster units and mana resources; and changes religions and civilizations from being mostly interchangeable to wholly different experiences.()A full-length review in Pelit magazine awarded FfH 92% describing the mod as a clump of clichs at first sight that turns out to be the finest fantasy strategy since of Magic and the best times of Warlords. The reviewer further complimented a strong backstory (for a mod) and an extensive manual and Civilopedia. He criticized technical problems with online multiplayer, problems that are largely beyond a mods capacity to fix, some problems with sound and high system requirements.(II and III both included popular War II scenarios and IV is no exception.  Beyond the Sword introduces a fan-created mod, The Road to War.  The Road to War offers three variants - Pacific 1936, Europe 1936, and Europe 1939 - as well as a host of different scenario-specific units.

Renewable_energy_in_Australia
energy in Australia represents 5.2% of total energy consumption, but only 1.7% of total production, the difference being the result of significant non-renewable energy exports. In the five years to 2009 renewable energy consumption grew by 3.5%, faster than other energy sources. Of all renewable energy sources, hydro represents 63.4%, wind 22.9%, bioenergy 11.5%. photovoltaic 2.1%, and other sources (such as wave and tidal, solar thermal, and geothermal) 0.042%.() Note that these figures exclude a significant amount of energy saved through use of solar water heating units as they do not actually produce electricity; this is calculated separately to be 7.4% of clean energy production.() Biogas had the fastest rate of growth in 2008-09 with around 33%, followed by solar and wind with 6.5%.(Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics: Australian energy production, consumption and trade, 197374 to 200809, retrieved 19 November 2010)  In the year to October 2010 Australian electricity production was 251 TWh, with an estimated 21,751 GWh or 8.67% generated from renewables, and 91.33% from fossil fuels (note: this excludes a further approximately 1.6 GWh produced through solar water heating).() This compares to 2006 figures, where approximately 9,500 GWh of electricity came from renewable sources, representing less than 4% of electricity consumption for that year.(Global green) Australia has the potential for vast renewable energy capabilities. However this is not yet fully realised and the countrys abundant resources are currently under utilised. The significant deployment of these technologies would substantially mitigate Australias gas emissions, as electricity generation accounts for the majority of the countrys carbon emissions. Solar and energy sources are being harnessed on a comparatively  small scale, and are at the stage of commercialisation. Other sources are being investigated and considered, such as geothermal and power.In 2010, The Australian Government introduced the Large-Scale Generation Target of 41,000 gigawatt-hours of renewable generation from power stations, along side the Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme, an uncapped scheme to support rooftop solar power and solar hot water, to ensure that renewable energy share of 20% of electricity supply by 2020.(Australian Government: Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator - LRET-SRES Basics) Several State governments also provide tariffs to encourage photovoltaics.

Each year an average of 9,000 GWh of hydro-electricity is generated by the company.() In 200708 hydro-electricity represented 15% of renewable energy production in Australia.(Wind powerFile:IMG 4001 Windy Hill Wind Farm.JPG|thumb|Hill Wind Farm, Atherton Tablelands, QueenslandAs of October 2010, around 22.9% of Australias renewable electricity, and 2% of Australias total electricity, was sourced from wind power,( enough electricity to power more than 700,000 homes.() This came from 52 operating wind farms containing a total of 1,052 turbines producing approximately 5,000 GWh of electricity per year. This figure represented approximately a 30% increase in wind power generation each year over the previous decade, or a total increase of more than 1,000% over that time. The total installed capacity as of October 2010 was 1,880 MW (including only projects over 100 kW), with a further 1,043 MW under construction.(power in South Australia is a fast growing industry, and the state of South Australia is well suited for wind farms. More wind power is generated in South Australia than any other Australian state or territory; as of October 2010 South Australia had an installed capacity of 907 MW from 435 turbines accounting for close to 20% of that states electricity needs, considerably ahead of Victoria with 428 MW from 267 turbines, and Western Australia with 202 MW from 142 turbines.( The Wind Farm near Victoria, completed in 2009, was the largest wind farm in the southern hemisphere,( consisting of 128 turbines spread over 173 km2( and rated at 192 MW, however in terms of generating capacity Bonney Wind Farm near South Australia was the largest with 239.5 MW, despite only having 99 turbines. These figures were set to be surpassed by the Wind Farm at Victoria, scheduled to open in 2013 with a capacity of 420 MW.(Solar Solar photovoltaicsSolar photovoltaic (PV) technology generates electricity from sunlight, and it can be used in grid-connected and off-grid applications.The issue for the Australian photovoltaics industry today is that there is enormous market potential, built up through a natural competitiveness in Australian research and development, industry investment and government policy support. However, despite this, the industry is not yet self-sustaining and advantages gained to date could be lost.(Australian Business Council for Sustainable Energy. The Australian Photovoltaic Industry Roadmap p. 1.) A 2004 market report suggested that a partnership between government and industry is necessary:The PV industry cannot continue to actively invest in strategic industry development unless the Australian government is also committed to the journey. The industry ... requires policy and program support to assist it in bridging the gap to mainstream commercial competitiveness.(Two recent projects which illustrate co-operation between industry and government are the solar power station planned for north-western Victoria, and the development of new solar cells.Mildura Solar concentrator power stationMany projects have demonstrated the feasibility of power in Australia and a large new power station in Victoria is planned.Solar Systems is to build the worlds most advanced(Australia advances with solar power The Times, 26 October 2006.) photovoltaic (PV) heliostat solar concentrator power station in north-western Victoria.

A solar water heater manufacturing industry was subsequently established in Australia and a large proportion of the manufactured product was exported. Four of the original companies are still in business and the manufacturing base has now expanded to 24 companies. Despite an excellent solar resource, the penetration of solar water heaters in the Australian domestic market is only about 5%, with new dwellings accounting for most sales.(Lovegrove, Keith and Dennis, Mike.

This is the 95 MW Wind Farm which is expected to be fully commissioned late in 2008.Government policySubsidies for fossil fuelsGovernments in Australia provide substantial financial support for the production and use of fossil fuels, through direct payments, favourable tax treatment, and other actions. These subsidies keep the cost of fossil fuel energy artificially low, and make it harder for renewable energy to compete. They distort energy markets, encourage greater use of fossil fuels, create higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions, and improve the profitability of energy companies that produce or use fossil fuels. Calculated figures in 2011 put the total fossil fuel subsidies by the Australian government at AU$12.2 billion annually.() This compared to just just AU$1.1 billion spent on climate policy such as support for renewables in 201011; furthermore, the funding gap between government climate change initiatives and fossil fuel subsidies had increased by AU$1 billion in the preceding three years.(Politics of global warmingAustralia is one of the major exporters of coal, the burning of which contributes significantly to anthropogenic change.

It has policy responsibility for some financial incentives for the production and use of renewable energy, and for the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) which requires an additional 9,500 GWh of electricity to be produced from renewable sources by the year 2010:(Australian Government. Australian Greenhouse Office: Government programmes):The legislation behind MRET, the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000, came into effect on 1 April 2001 and requires electricity retailers and major electricity users to purchase a specified percentage of their electricity from renewable energy generators. These parties must acquire Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) which demonstrate that they have sourced power from renewable energy generators. Each REC represents one megawatt hour of electricity. If an electricity retailer or major user hasnt acquired enough RECs to meet their annual target under the legislation, they must pay a $40/MWh penalty.(Greenhouse response actions)Other Australian Government support for business, including renewable energy businesses, is delivered by the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources.(Despite the Tambling review, the Howard government decided not to extend the Mandatory Renewable Energy Targets Scheme.(Allens Arthur Robinson, Federal Government Energy White Paper) However, various state Labor governments have recently announced their own renewable energy target schemes.(NSW announces renewable energy targets ABC News, 9 November 2006.)(Climate Change and Greenhouse Emissions Reduction Act 2007)(Earth, Wind & Fire Four Corners, 16 April 2007.)Politics of wind powerFrom 2001 to early 2006, the main driving force for the establishment of wind farms in Australia was the Governments Mandatory Renewable Energy Target or MRET.(Lovegrove, Keith.

Also, in 2006, several Federal Government Ministers spoke out against several wind farm proposals.(Leaked minutes from a 2004 meeting between leaders of energy intensive industries and the Australian government describe how both groups were worried that mandatory renewable energy targets were working too well and were market skewed towards wind power.(Minutes of a meeting of the Low Emissions Technology Advisory Group (LETAG) with the Australian Government 6 May 2006.)Dr Diesendorf has suggested that the Howard Government tried to stop the development of wind power, the lowest-cost, new, renewable electricity source, until such time as coal-fired power stations with CO2 capture and sequestration and possibly nuclear power stations are available.(Diesendorf, Mark (2007). Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy, UNSW Press, p. 109.)Public opinion and actionSurvey results suggest that there is considerable public support for the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency in Australia. In one recent survey, 74% of respondents favoured a greenhouse strategy based mainly on energy efficiency and renewable energy, and 19% favoured an approach that focuses mainly on nuclear power and clean coal technologies.(The Australian results from the 1st Annual World Environment Review, based on a survey of 1,007 people in 2007, found that:(First Annual World Environment Review Poll Reveals Countries Want Governments to Take Strong Action on Climate Change Global Market Insite, 5 June 2007.)* 88% of Australians think that the Government should do more to increase the use of solar power. 78% say the government should do more to boost wind power, 58% hydro power, 50% tidal power, and 38% geothermal power, while only 25% think that the Government should do more to increase use of nuclear power.* 84% of Australians think that the Government should make it easier for people to buy renewable electricity.* 89% think that all electricity should contain a minimum 25% of power generated from renewable energy sources. Only 3% disagree.* 82% think that the Government should make it easier for people to buy solar panels.* 80% think that the Government should make it easier for people to buy energy efficient products, such as energy-saving light globes, water-saving shower heads and insulation etc.* 85% think that the Government should raise national fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks.* 87% think that the Government should do more to increase the number of cars that dont use petrol.There is a considerable movement known as Transition Decade to transition Australias entire energy system to renewable by 2020.Voluntary uptake of GreenPower, a Government program initiated in 1997 whereby people can pay extra for electricity that is generated from renewable sources, increased from 132,300 customers in 2005 to 904,716 customers in 2009.(ABS: Year Book Australia, 200910, retrieved 19 November 2010)Future prospectsSeveral recent reports have discussed the possibility of Australia setting a renewable energy target of 25 per cent by 2020.(CSIRO (2007). Rural Australia Providing Climate Solutions p.1)(Australian Conservation Foundation (2007). A Bright Future: 25% Renewable Energy for Australia by 2020) Combined with some basic energy efficiency measures, such a target could deliver 15,000 MW new renewable power capacity, $33 billion in new investment, 16,600 new jobs, and 69 million tonnes reduction in electricity sector greenhouse gas emissions.(Greenpeace released a report in 2008 called Energy revolution: A Sustainable Energy Australia Outlook, detailing how Australia could produce 40% of its energy through renewable energy by 2020 and completely phase out coal-fired power by 2030 without any job losses.(http://www.greenpeace.org.au/energyrevolution/pdf/energyRevolution_full.pdf Energy revolution: A Sustainable Energy Australia Outlook, Teske, Sven and Vincent, Julien, Greenpeace International 2008)David Spratt and Phillip Sutton argue in their book Climate Code Red that Australia (as part of a concerted global effort) needs to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions down to zero as quickly as possible so that carbon dioxide can be drawn down from the atmosphere and greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced to less than 325 ppm CO2-e, which they argue is the upper safe climate level at which we can continue developing infinitely. They outline a plan of action which would accomplish this.(Spratt, David and Sutton, Phillip, Climate Code Red: The case for a sustainability emergency, Friends of the Earth, Melbourne 2008)Australia could switch completely to renewable energy within the 2010 decade by building a dozen vast, new power stations and about 6500 turbines, according to a major new study.

The complete program is shot on location in settings that are meaningful to the subject.Season oneIn 2006, the first season of Contact, lencyclopdie de la cration was composed of 13 episodes, most of which were shot in Europe.Episode 1: Franco DragoneFrom La Louvire, Belgium, to Las Vegas, Dragone left his name of some of the most memorable stage creations of the last decade. Dragone directed most of the earliest shows of du Soleil as well as Dions New Day... and Le Rve presented at the Las Vegas hotel and casino.In Contact, he tells Bureau what it meant for him after his international success to bring back some hope to his dying mining community by creating his Dragone production company. He also reflects on his creative process and on the fear of having no more to offer to his art.Episode 2: Jean DOrmessonThe quintessential Parisian, DOrmesson has written extensively about his royalist family and his love of Venice. The son of an ambassador, DOrmesson became in 1973 the youngest member of the franaise to which he later contributed getting the first woman ever admitted.In Contact, the 82 year old writer gets teary eyed saying that his father may have died thinking him a failure.Episode 3: ric-Emmanuel SchmittThe most sold author in the French language, Schmitt lives in Brussels and his plays have been staged all over the world. He wanted to be a musician but finally turned to philosophy and became a writer.Episode 4: Simone VeilA survivor of the death camp of Auschwitz Veil later became lawyer, a judge and major political figure in France and at the parliament.In Contact, she poignantly recollects how the detainees in the death camp were stripped of any shred of humanity. She saw her mother die from disease in the camps and her father and brother were never heard of again after being deported.Episode 5: Jacques AttaliAn adviser to French President Mitterrand, Attali is an economist, writer and thinker. He was the first president of the Bank for Reconstruction and Development and later founded PlaNet finance a non-profit organization specializing in credit.The brother of a psychoanalyst, Attali says he always refused to go into analysis because he is scared that the delicate movements of his mind could not be put back together after having been disassembled.

Chivilingo_Hydroelectric_Plant
Chivilingo Hydroelectric Plant is a historic power station located 14 kilometers south of Chile. It came on line in 1897, and was the first hydroelectric plant in Chile and the second in South America. The plant is now registered on the of IEEE Milestones in engineering, and open to visitors.()The Chivilingo plant dates to 1893 when its first feasibility studies were performed for the Lota undersea coal mine operated by the Compaa Explotadora de Lota y Coronel at depths of up to 12 km. Chief engineer William E. Raby formulated its initial plans, which settled upon the production of current to feed three phase motors, powered by waterfalls of the nearby River.Construction work began in 1896, with civil works and the aqueduct built by the mining company, and hydraulic and electric engineering performed by Consolidated Co. of North America and & Co. of Nrnberg, Germany. Two turbines powered two alternators of 215 kilowatts each (315 horsepower, 400 volts, 360 amperes, 50 Hertz). The resultant current power was then transferred to the undersea mine via a 10 kilovolt transmission line approximately 10 km in length.The Chivilingo plant was in operation from 1897 to 1975, in its later years as part of the Central Interconnected System. In 1998 it was transferred by the city of Lota to the Chile which now operates tours for visitors. References (* Chivilingo Hydroelectric Power Stationhidroelctrica de Chivilingo

John_Dale_Lace
thumb|Josephine Dale Lacethumb|NorthwardsColonel John Dale Lace (27 November 1859 &ndash; 5 June 1937) was a African gold and diamond mining magnate and Randlord. He was born in St Mary on the of Man.He was twice married to Josephine Cornelia Brink (Jos) from Richmond in the Karoo, who died 14 May 1937. He met and married Jos for the first time when she was in London pursuing an acting career. It is believed that she was proposed to by John Rhodes, prime minister of the Cape at the time, and was mistress to King Edward VII. It is known that she was mistress to another man Beckett, 2nd Baron Grimthorpe, with whom she had a son, although she claimed it was Edward VIIs son. The second time, after Ernest Beckett declined to marry her, she and John married in Cape Town and John adopted her son. They never had children of their own. Josephine Dale Lace was a flamboyant Johannesburg socialite who was often seen in a carriage drawn by a team of zebras. The Dale Laces were owners of one of Johannesburgs most prominent historic landmarks, the Parktown mansion Northwards, designed by British architect Baker in 1904.Just as the gold-mining industry was booming, the diamond market was being monopolised by Beers, which went on to become the worlds largest diamond company - the dissipation of the Dale Lace fortune coincided with a devastating fire at Northwards, and in 1912, the charred remains of the house were sold to Albu. John Dale Lace lost his fortune and he and Jos went to live at Boschkop, northwest of Johannesburg.

Thomas_Walsh_(miner)
right|thumb|Thomas Walsh in 1904.Thomas Francis Walsh (April 2, 1850, in Tipperary, Ireland  April 8, 1910, in D.C., United States) was an Irish-American miner who discovered one of the largest mines in America. He was also famous for giving the famed Diamond to his daughter Walsh McLean as a wedding present.He was probably born on his fathers farm, Grange, in Lisronagh, Tipperary, Ireland and was the son of Michael Walsh, a farmer, and Bridget Scully. According to his daughters book, Father Struck It Rich he was apprenticed to a millwright at age twelve and soon became a fine carpenter.In 1869, he emigrated to the United States with his sister, Maria, after the death of his father.  For a time, he settled in Worcester, Massachusetts, with his aunts, Catherine and Bridget Walsh Power, who helped shake the greenhorn off him.Around 1870 or 71, he heeded the call to go west young man and soon found himself in Colorado getting paid top dollar for those scarce carpentry skills he allegedly learned from his appenticeship to a millwright. During the 1870s, the Hills of Dakota saw a rush that attracted hoards of hopeful men afflicted with gold fever. At first Walsh was attracted too but not to the gold. He wanted in on the opportunities to trade goods and services at inflated prices. Gradually, he became more and more immersed in the world of gold and was soon trading mining equipment to prospectors for mining claims as payment. He also studied mining technology at night. In 1877, he returned to Colorado with between $75,000 and $100,000. He and his between $75,000 and $100,000 soon found themselves in Colorado where he married the ravishingly beautiful school-marm Carrie Bell Reed on July 11, 1879. The couple had two children:* Walsh: August 01, 1886---April 24, 1947* Walsh: April 09, 1888------August 19, 1905After becoming an expert in the subject, Thomas Walsh finally was overcome by gold fever and took to the hills. Unlike other prospectors he took a far more methodical and careful approach to prospecting which soon paid off.In 1896, he came home and uttered the words which later was the title of his daughters book, Daughter, Ive struck it rich! The Camp Bird Gold Mine near Colorado soon turned out $5,000/day in ore and produced riches for the Walsh family beyond the dreams of avarice.The money soon provided the family with a lavish lifestyle that included trips to Europe, fine clothes, and expensive motor cars. Around 1898, the family moved to Washington, D.C. Thomas Walsh was appointed by President McKinley as a commissioner to the Exposition of 1899In 1903 the family moved into the ornate mansion at 2020 Massachusetts Avenue. Later, this house became the Indonesian Embassy.(Weeks, Christopher (1994). AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington, D.C. (3d ed.), pp. 179-80.  Johns Hopkins University Press. ISBN 0-8018-4712-5.)Thomas Francis Walsh died on April 8, 1910, at his home in Washington, D.C.Thomas Walsh had the following siblings:* Maria Walsh: married Arthur Lafferty, a two-gun police sergeant in Leadville, Colorado* Michael Walsh: died in 1904 in Colorado, of dropsy of the liverOther siblings? Ryan, in her book, Hope, claims Thomas had half siblings from a later marriage his father made to Margaret Cunningham.Thomas Walsh is a cousin twice removed to Arthur Garrity, Jr., the federal judge who issued the famous 1974 order that Boston schools desegregate by means of busing.Thomas Walsh is a cousin once removed to New York City civic improver and Macys Lawyer, L.

Crane_Carrier_Company
Crane Carrier Company (often abbreviated CCC) is a manufacturer that specializes in construction truck and truck chassis. Located in Oklahoma, it was established by Samuel Zeligson in 1946, along with the affiliated Trucks. The primary design of CCCs trucks are Cab-Beside-Engine (C.B.E.) or half-cabs, most notably the Century II Unimixer. Half-cabs have the advantage of being able to carry the booms of cranes, hence the name of the company.(http://www.cranecarrier.com/)HistoryBeginning as a firm that remanufactured War II-era surplus vehicles, CCC evolved into a company that manufactured its own over-the-road trucks for concrete mixing, logging, mining, and other construction industries. CCC also builds trucks for oil drilling, well drilling, terminal tractors, and fuelers.Though primarily building CBEs, CCC started moving toward the two-seater market during the 1970s, with models such as the Centaur. CCC sold Zeligson in 1980. It lasted as a separate company for nine years.CCC manufactured Type D school bus chassis during the early to mid 1990s, which were used by bus manufacturers Body Company and Corporation.In 2008, CCC and its parent, CCI Corp., were sold to Glenview, Illinois-based Tool Works, which stated its plans to continue operating CCC as a separate company.(Illinois company acquires Crane Carrier, World, September 16, 2008.)Resources*The Complete Book of Trucks & Tractors, by John Carroll & Peter Davies.*American Truck & Bus Spotters Guide; 19201985, by Tad Burness.External links*CCC Official Site (JavaScript Required)*Martin Phippard Photograph (Hanks Truck Pictures)*Yard Truck Information Center (Truck Pictures & History)*CCC (Internet Movie Cars Database)

Peoples_Republic_of_China__Pakistan_relations
 Peoples Republic of ChinaPakistan relations began in 1950 when Pakistan was among the first countries to break relations with the of China on Taiwan and recognize the PRC. Following the 1962 War, both countries has placed considerable importance on the maintenance of a extremely close and supportive relationship.()()() Since then, the two countries have regularly exchanged high-level visits resulting in a variety of agreements. The PRC has provided economic, military and technical assistance to Pakistan and each considers the other a close strategic ally.()()      Bilateral relations have evolved from an initial Chinese policy of neutrality to a partnership that links a smaller but militarily powerful Pakistan, partially dependent on China for its economic and military strength, with China attempting to balance competing interests in the region. Diplomatic relations were established in 1950, military assistance began in 1966, a strategic alliance was formed in 1972 and economic co-operation began in 1979. China has become Pakistans largest supplier of arms and its third-largest trading partner.(Pakistan wants China to build it a naval base)(China to Fast-Track Jets for Pakistan) Recently, both nations have decided to cooperate in improving Pakistans civilian nuclear program.(China says Pakistan nuclear deal peaceful)   Favorable relations with China is a pillar of Pakistans foreign policy. China supported Pakistans opposition to the Unions intervention in Afghanistan and is perceived by Pakistan as a regional counterweight to India and the States. China and Pakistan also share close military relations, with China supplying a range of modern armaments to the Pakistani defense forces. China supports Pakistans stance on Kashmir while Pakistan supports China on the issues of Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan. Lately, military cooperation has deepened with joint projects producing armaments ranging from jets to guided missile frigates. Chinese cooperation with Pakistan has reached economic high points, with substantial Chinese investment in Pakistani infrastructural expansion including the Pakistani deep water port at Gwadar. Both countries have an ongoing trade agreement. Pakistan has served as Chinas main bridge between Muslim countries. Pakistan also played an important role in bridging the communication gap between China and the West by facilitating the Nixon visit to China.BackgroundPakistan has a long and symbiotic relationship with China. The long-standing ties between the two countries have been mutually supportive. A close identity of views and mutual interests remain the hallmark of bilateral ties. Since the 1962 War, Pakistan has supported China on most issues of importance to the latter, especially those related to the question of Chinas sovereignty like Taiwan, Xinjiang, and Tibet and other sensitive issues such as human rights.(Eager Eyes Fixed on Eurasia Russia and Its Neighbors in Crisis Russia and Its Neighbors in Crisis, Edited by IWASHITA Akihiro, Slavic Research Center, p 212)Image:Pakistan airforce FC-1 Xiao Long.jpg|thumb|left|altJF-17 Thunder.|The Thunder is a joint Pakistan-China project.The Chinese leadership has acknowledged Pakistans steadfast support on key issues. Pakistan helped China in reestablishing formal ties with the West, where they helped make possible the 1972 Nixon visit to China. Pakistan has collaborated with China in extensive military and economic projects, seeing China as a counterweight to India and the States. Pakistan has also served as a conduit for Chinas influence in the Muslim world.(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan-OIC_relations#China.27s_representation_in_OIC_through_Pakistan)China also has a consistent record of supporting Pakistan in regional issues. During the Pakistan-Indian tensions in 2008, it implied that it would support Pakistan in the event of a war. Pakistans military depends heavily on Chinese armaments, and joint projects of both economic and militaristic importance are ongoing. China has supplied equipment to support Pakistans nuclear program, and has been accused of giving nuclear technology to Pakistan.(China tested N-weapons for Pak: US insider Times of India 6 September 2008)Diplomatic relationsrelations between Pakistan and China were established on 21 May 1951, shortly after the defeat of the Of China in 1949.(Pakistan and China Relations) While initially ambivalent towards the idea of a Communist country on its borders, Pakistan hoped that China would serve as a counterweight to Indian influence. India had recognized China a year before, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru also hoped for closer relations with the Chinese. However, with escalating border tensions leading to the 1962 Sino-Indian war, China and Pakistan aligned with each other in a joint effort to counter perceived Indian encroachment. One year after Chinas border war with India, Pakistan ceded the Tract to China to end border disputes and improve diplomatic relations.Since then, an informal alliance that initially consisted of joint Indian opposition has grown into a lasting relationship that has benefited both nations on the diplomatic, economic and military frontiers. Along with diplomatic support, Pakistan served as a conduit for China to open up to the West. China has in turn provided extensive economic aid and political support towards Pakistan. thumb|300px|Disputed territory ceded to China in 1963.Pakistans military initially depended almost entirely on American armaments and aid, which was increased during the covert U.S. support of Islamic militants in the war in Afghanistan. America under US President Nixon supported Pakistan in the 1971 Liberation War.(Shalom, Stephen R., The Men Behind Yahya in the Indo-Pak War of 1971) However, the period following the Soviet withdrawal and the of the Soviet Union led indirectly to the increasing realignment of America with the previously pro-Soviet India. The Pressler Amendment in 1990 suspended all American military assistance and any new economic aid amidst concerns that Pakistan was attempting to develop a nuclear weapon.(http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entitylarry_pressler_1) Given the support that Pakistan had given them during the War in Afghanistan, many Pakistanis saw this as a betrayal that sold out Pakistani interests in favor of India. This belief was further strengthened as India had developed a nuclear weapon without significant American opposition, and Pakistan felt obligated to do the same. Consequently, the primarily geopolitical alliance between Pakistan and China has since 1990 branched out into military and economic cooperation, due to Pakistans belief that Americas influence and support in the region should be counterbalanced by the Chinese.With the in Afghanistan leading to renewed relations with the U.S., there is a general sentiment in Pakistan to adopt a foreign policy which favors China over the United States.(Global Security and Pakistan Foreign Policy Makers Urged to tie strongly with China compared to US) Washington has been accused deserting Pakistan in favor of a policy that favors stronger relations with India, while Pakistan sees China as a more reliable ally over the long term.( )Since 9/11, Pakistan has increased the scope of Chinese influence and support by agreeing to a number of military projects, combined with extensive economic support and investment from the Chinese. This is partially due to Pakistans strategy of playing off the two powers against each other, but also a genuine effort to prevent Americas influence in the region from becoming too strong. In return, the Chinese hope to strengthen Pakistan as a counterbalance to American and Indian influence.Military relationsThe Republic of China enjoys strong defense ties with Pakistan.() This relationship between two adjoining Asian countries is important in the worlds geo-strategic alliances. The strong defense ties are primarily to counter regional Indian and American influence, and was also to repel Soviet influence in the area.  In recent years this relationship has strengthened through ongoing defence projects and agreements between Pakistan and China.Since 1962, China has been a steady source of military equipment to the Army, helping establish munition factories, providing technological assistance and modernizing existing facilities.() The countries are involved in the joint venture of several projects to enhance military and weaponry systems, which include collaborating in the development of Thunder fighter aircraft, Karakorum advance training aircraft, technology, AWACS systems, tanks and the cruise missile. The armies have a schedule for organising joint military exercises.()framepx200|right|thumb|Gwadar Port.China is the largest investor in the Gwadar Deep Sea Port, which is strategically located at the mouth of the of Hormuz.() It is viewed warily by both America and India as a possible launchpad for Chinese naval operations in the Indian Ocean.(Gwadar, Pakistan  the most important city youve never heard of, New York Post.) However the Gwadar Port is currently delayed due to a multilateral diplomatic standoff between the project leaders and the Singapore government.China has offered Pakistan military aid in order to fight against terrorism in Pakistan. Pakistan has purchased military equipment from China in order to bolster their efforts against Islamic militants.()In the past, China has played a major role in the development of Pakistans nuclear infrastructure, especially when increasingly stringent export controls in countries made it difficult for Pakistan to acquire materials and uranium enriching equipment from elsewhere. China has supplied Pakistan with equipment to advance their nuclear weapons program, such as the Chinese help in building the Khushab reactor, which plays a key role in Pakistans production of plutonium. A subsidiary of the National Nuclear Corporation contributed in Pakistans efforts to expand its uranium enrichment capabilities by providing 5,000 custom made ring magnets, which are a key component of the bearings that facilitate the high-speed rotation of centrifuges. China has also provided technical and material support in the completion of the Nuclear Power Complex and plutonium reprocessing facility, which was built in the mid 1990s.() China may also have supplied nuclear technology to the Pakistanis, enabling Pakistan to become a nuclear state with an estimated 100 warheads as of 2011. (China tested N-weapons for Pak: US insider Times of India 6 September 2008)()Economic relationsEconomic trade between Pakistan and China are increasing at a rapid pace and a free trade agreement has recently been signed. Military and technological transactions continue to dominate the economic relationship between the two nations, although in recent years China has pledged to vastly increase their investment in Pakistans economy and infrastructure. Among other things, China has been helping to develop Pakistans infrastructure through the building of power plants, roads and communication nodes.()Both countries are keen on strengthening the economic ties between the two, and have promised to propel cross-border trade. This has led to investment in Pakistans nascent financial and energy sectors, amidst a surge of Chinese investment designed to strengthen ties. Pakistan has in turn been granted free trade zones in China.()The economic relationship between Pakistan and China is composed primarily of Chinese investment in Pakistani interests. Chinas increasing economic clout has enabled a wide variety of projects to be sponsored in Pakistan through Chinese credit. Pakistani investment in China is also encouraged, and cross-border trade remains fluid.( )In 2011 China Kingho Group canceled a $19 billion mining deal because of security concerns.(US finds new friend in Uzbekistan after Pakistan fallout. Telegraph Media Group Limited, 30 September 2011.)ViewsThe support with which China and Pakistan give each other is considered important in global diplomacy, and has been compared to  United States relations. (http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2010/10/20101028135728235512.html) According to a Pew survey of Pakistan public opinion last year, 84 percent of respondents said they had a favorable view of China  and 16 percent had a favorable view of the United States. These results showed that Pakistan is the most pro-China country in the world.() Similarly, the Chinese state-run media has portrayed Pakistan in a favorable light in regional issues.Pakistan and China have long praised the close ties the two countries have with each other. China has been referred to by Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf as their time-tested and all-weather friend, while in return Chinese president Hu Jintao  has referred to Pakistan as a good friend and partner.() These statements are noted by some observers as occurring after Pakistani relations with the United States or India have become strained, such as after Bin Laden was killed by American forces without Pakistans prior permission.( ) IssuesThe ETIM is a Waziri based mujihadeen organization that is said to be allied with the Taliban,(http://waziristanhills.com/Taliban/MilitantOrganizations/EastTurkistanIslamicMovementETIM/tabid/141/language/en-GB/Default.aspx) which has received funding from rogue elements in the ISI.() As these militants are labeled as terrorists from the Chinese province of Xinjiang, Pakistans inability to prevent this is a potential source of conflict.(http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Politics/03-Jun-2009/Hu-Jintao-urges-Zardari-to-crush-ETIM-extremists)()The U.S. On Terror has the Chinese wary of U.S. influence in the region, and as Pakistan is a US ally and major recipient of US military and economic aid, China is obligated to step up its support in order to maintain its influence in the region. As political alliances shift, Pakistan may have allies in the United States and China that may begin to see each other as rivals. Similarly, the warming of relations puts Pakistans traditional alliance with China against India at risk. While the level of cooperation between Pakistan and China is far closer than that of India, it poses a future problem for Pakistan-China relations.2011 Hotan AttackThe 2011 Hotan Attack was a series of coordinated bomb and knife attacks that occurred in Hotan, Xinjiang, Peoples Republic of China on July 18, 2011.  While many had always suspected Pakistani involvement in terrorism in Xinjiang, the 2011 Hotan attack marked the first incident of acknowledgement of this by authorities in China.(http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/china-claims-terrorists-trained-in-pakistan/story-e6frg6n6-1226106224890)TimelineImportant events:: 1950 - Pakistan becomes the third non-communist country, and first Muslim one, to recognize the Peoples Republic of China.: 1951 - Beijing and Karachi establish diplomatic relations.: 1963 - Pakistan cedes the Trans-Karakoram Tract to China, ending border disputes.: 1970 - Pakistan helps the U.S. arrange the Nixon visit to China.: 1978 - The Highway linking the mountainous Pakistan with China officially opens.: 1980s - China and the U.S. provide support through Pakistan to the Afghan guerrillas fighting Soviet occupational forces.: 1986 - China and Pakistan reach a comprehensive nuclear co-operation agreement.: 1996 - Chinese President Zemin pays a state visit to Pakistan.: 1999 - A 300-megawatt nuclear power plant, built with Chinese help in Punjab province, is completed. : 2001 - A joint-ventured Chinese-Pakistani tank, the MBT-2000 (Al-Khalid) MBT is completed.: 2002 - The building of the Gwadar deep sea port begins, with China as the primary investor.: 2003 -  Pakistan and China signed a $110 million contract for the construction of a housing project on Multan Road in Lahore(): 2007 - The Sino-Pakistani joint-ventured multirole aircraft - the Thunder (FC-1 Fierce Dragon) is formally rolled out.:2008 -  Pakistan welcomes the Chinese Olympic Torch in an Islamabad sports stadium, under heavy guard amidst security concerns.():2008 - China and Pakistan sign an free trade agreement. :2008 - Pakistan and China to build a railway through the Highway, in order to link Chinas rail network to Port.:2008 - The F-22P frigate, comes into service with the Navy.

Overton,_Wakefield
Overton is a small village in Yorkshire, England, between Wakefield and Huddersfield. It lies about  south west of Wakefield,  south of Ossett,  west of Netherton and  south west of Horbury.The village was originally named Over Shitlington,() and was part of the parish of Shitlington but this was changed sometime after 1855, along with the name of the parish, which was changed to Sitlington. Overton is also linked with Netherton.Overton is described by the locals as the village with two pubs, a church, a prison and the National Coal Mining Museum. Overton is a picturesque village surrounded by fields, Coxley Woods and natural scenery. St. Lukes Parish Church is part of the parish of Sitlington and is run by Rev. Hugh Baker.Overton is known for the Coal Mining Museum, situated on the A642. This mine was worked from at least 1789 until the coal was exhausted in 1985. Following the Miners Strike (1984-1985), work was started to convert it into a museum. The men were transferred to Denby Grange Colliery.ReferencesExternal links*http://www.coxleynews.com - a Community website about the villages of Netherton, Middlestown, Overton and Midgley in the Parish of Sitlington West Yorkshire and named after the beautiful Coxley Woods that runs along the valley between the villages.*http://www.wakefield.gov.uk - Wakefield, Overtons council and local city(Wakefield)

He is best known as a former billionaire whose fortune collapsed after he and his brother William Herbert Hunt tried but failed to corner the world market in silver.() He is also a successful thoroughbred horse breeder.()PersonalHunt was born in Dorado, Arkansas, and currently lives in Dallas, Texas.(  (Archived by WebCite)) He is the son of Lyda Bunker and oil tycoon L. Hunt and the brother of Hunt, founder of the Football League and City Chiefs.Business careerNelson Bunker Hunt played a very significant role in the discovery and development of the oil fields in Libya, which would later be nationalized by al-Gaddafi.()He owns the Texas based Titan Resources Corp, which is involved in the exploration of oil in North Africa.(Ethiopia, U.S. Billionaires Titan Resources Signs Oil Accord, by Jason McLure, www.bloomberg.com, 8/21/08) He is chairman of Hunt Exploration and Mining Company (HEMCO). Silver manipulation Beginning in the early 1970s, Hunt and his brother William Herbert Hunt began accumulating large amounts of silver. By 1979, they had nearly cornered the global market.() In the last nine months of 1979, the brothers profited by an estimated $2 billion to $4 billion in silver speculation, with estimated silver holdings of 100 million ounces (6.25 million pounds).()During the Hunt brothers accumulation of the precious metal, prices of silver contracts and silver bullion during 1979 and 1980 rose from $11 an ounce in September 1979 to $50 an ounce in January 1980. Silver prices ultimately collapsed to below $11 an ounce two months later.  The largest single day drop in the price of silver occurred on Thursday.(Hunt filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in September 1988, largely due to lawsuits incurred as a result of his silver speculation.(In 1989 in a settlement with the States Futures Trading Commission, Nelson Bunker Hunt was fined US$10 million and banned from trading in the commodity markets as a result of civil charges of conspiring to manipulate the silver market stemming from his attempt to the market in silver.( This fine was in addition to a multimillion-dollar settlement to pay back taxes, fines and interest to the Revenue Service for the same period.(PoliticsHe has been extremely active in conservative political causes() and  is a member of the Council of the Birch Society.(He was one of the main sponsors of the conservative organization Goals Foundation founded in 1979 by General K. Singlaub, journalist John Rees, and Democratic Congressman from Georgia McDonald.During the mid 1980s, Bunker Hunt contributed almost half a million U.S. dollars to The National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty (NEPL),()() a conservative fundraising organization later heavily implicated in the affair.() Hunt is past Chairman of the Board of the Bible Society of Texas and the past Chairman of, and significant contributor to Crusade for Christ Internationals Heres Life Campaign (197680),()() as well as providing a $3.5 million loan guarantee for the 1979 Campus Crusade film Jesus.()Thoroughbred horse racingThe United States Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) has awarded Hunt the title of legendary owner-breeder.() Overall, Hunt bred 158 stakes winners and either bred or owned 25 champions.(Blood-Horse.com - February 14, 2005)In 1955, Hunt bought his first thoroughbreds and by the 1970s his breeding program had become one of the worlds largest and most productive. Winner of the U.S. Award for Outstanding Breeder in 1976, 1985, and 1987, he owned the  Farm in Kentucky, and raced thoroughbreds in Europe and America. Among his horses, Hunt bred or raced  Noble, Dahlia, Empery, Youth, Exceller, Trillion, Song, Dahar and Estrapade.(In 1973 and 1974, Hunt was the flat racing Champion Owner and in 1976 won the Derby.(Hunts bankruptcy forced him to liquidate his thoroughbred operations. A 1988 dispersal sale of 580 horses at Sales brought in $46,911,800, at that time the highest amount in the history of thoroughbred auctions.( In 1999, he returned to thoroughbred ownership, spending a total of $2,075,000 on 51 juveniles and yearlings. At the time Hunt said, At my age, I dont plan to do any breeding or buy a farm, I just want to have some fun and try to get lucky racing.( References  External links * H.L.

King_Coal_(book)
King Coal is a 1917 novel by Sinclair that describes the poor working conditions in the mining industry in the western States during the 1910s, from the perspective of a single protagonist, Hal Warner. As in his earlier work, Jungle, Sinclair uses the novel to express his socialist viewpoint.  The book is based on the 1914-1915 Colorado coal strikes.PlotHal Warner, a rich young fellow determined to find the truth for himself about conditions in the mines, runs away from home and adopts the alias Joe Smith. After being turned away by one coal mine for fear of Hal being a union organizer, he gets a job in another coal mine operated by the General Fuel Company, or GFC. In the mines he befriends many of the workers, and realizes their misery and exploitation at the hands of the bosses. He befriends Mary Burke, who is a passionate a fighter for the workers rights. Her father is a mine worker who spends his days drinking and leaving her to take care of her siblings. She and Hal grow close, which tears at Hals loyalty to his fiance back home. After dedicating himself to the workers cause, he tells them that he will appeal to the bosses to become a check weigh man who measures the amount of coal, but the GFC, wanting to cheat the workers out of their pay, appoints a company check weigh man. Hal is eventually put into the jail by the marshal, who is teased by Hal over conditions of the mines and accused by Hal of being corrupted and unfair to the workers. After an explosion in the mines, Hal seeks out Peter Harrigan, an old friend whose father owns the General Fuel Company. The workers organize a strike and union to demand their rights from the bosses, but the rescue effort goes longer than expected. The bosses are more intent on the tools and equipment than the miners. Damn the man! save the Mules! says a boss. Hal appeals to the Mine Workers to back the strike, but they refuse, telling him that the strike is primitive and unexpected and that to support it when its just started to participate in action would waste the unions resources.  Hal is told to wait a few more years for the other unions to strike, and only with a massive course of action could the unions win. Hal is left to tell the workers the grievous news but the workers nevertheless cheer out his name (some calling out Joe Smith and others Hal) for standing up for them. After a confrontation with his brother Edward, Hal resolves to return home and dedicate his life to the workers cause. Hal leaves and concludes that he is in love with Mary Burke.External links* http://www.du.edu/anthro/ludlow/cfhist.html

The_Ghost_of_the_Executed_Engineer
The Ghost of the Executed Engineer: Technology and the Fall of the Soviet Union is a documentary written by Graham, an MIT professor specializing in Russian technology history that criticizes the direction of Soviet industrialization.  The beginning of the book focuses on the life of Palchinsky, born in 1875 in a city on the Volga, Kazan.  He was a mining engineer who wished to take a more humanitarian approach to engineering than the communist government desired. The Ghost of the Executed Engineer was published by the Harvard University Press in 1993.  While the book does cover the life of Peter Palchinky, a major part of the book personifies the struggles and misfortunes of the Soviet industrialization. Peter Palchinsky Peter was the oldest son of five children. He grew up with his mother in the Volga river city of Kazan.  As a youth he was encouraged by his mother to read in the familys large inherited library.  It was at an early age that Peter became interested in science.  In the fall of 1893 he entered the Mining Institute in St. Petersburg, one of the elite engineering institutions of the Russia.  During his time at the institute he became interested and attracted to radical political doctrines.In 1901 Palchinsky was recruited by the Russian government to investigate the living conditions of workers in the coal mines of the Don Basin; however, his criticism of the workers living conditions was not well received. Shortly after the of 1905 Palchinsky became interested in the Revolutionary Party, which at the time was the largest party in Russia.  He sympathized with the moderate wing of the party and was sharply critical of the radicals.  He was implicated in the 1905 effort of the revolutionaries to declare a separate democratic.  It is not clear if he was an active participant in the movement or just a sympathizer.  Because there was no hard evidence to convince the Russian government that Palchinsky had a active role in the movement, he was not brought to trial, but instead exiled under the emergency powers granted to the police during revolutionary turmoil.After his 8 year Siberian exile, Palchinsky and his wife returned to their native land where he held several positions in the provisional government.  While probably not a formal member, he associated himself with the right wing of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and supported the war effort against Germany. In 1917 Bolshevic arranged for a takeover of the provincial government and imprisoned ministers and other officials of the Provisional Government including Palchinksy.Palchinsky resisted the Bolsheviks rule; however, gradually, he and many of his associates found certain aspects of the new Soviet political system beckoning. Their commitment to creating a planned economy, to industrialization, and to science and technology were promising to Palchinsky.Palchinsky believed that the obstacles to the Russias industrial advancement were not technological, but political, social, and educational. He argued that Russian engineers were not equipped  to deal with the competitive world because Russian engineers did not approach problems in a academic-dilettantish way.  Instead, they took on every problem as a purely technical one and assumed that if a solution incorporated the latest science, then it was the best solution.Palchinsky worked with the Soviet Authorities and the Communist party in planning industry and increasing the strength of Russia, but he was strongly against any takeover by the Party of any organization of which he was a member.  He opposed the interests of the Communist Party.  During this time, policies started by the Bolsheviks and Stalin emphasized huge projects controlled by Moscow.  These projects did not include consideration for local conditions and safety was sacrificed to output.  This did not set well with Palchinsky as he had seen firsthand the death and destruction caused when consideration of local conditions and safety measures were not taken. He continued to criticize these projects and was arrested in April 1928, and executed for his political position in 1929.Palchinsky was vilified by Soviet propaganda, and then mostly forgotten, but he is given a much more favourable hearing in Solzhenitsyns Gulag Archipelago (1974), pt.1 and November 1916 (1984) which present him as a clear-eyed, hard-working spokesman of the engineer community. Technology in the Soviet UnionStalins vision for the Soviet Union and industrialization was very different from Palchinskys.  Stalin had an ideological outlook for economic advancement in the Soviet Union that set unrealistic goals that required massive human effort.  Stalin emphasized that all industrial establishments should be of great size (preferable the largest in the world).  This came to be known as gigantomania by the Western observers. The results of taking on these astronomical industrial establishments were high accident rates and shoddy production.  The high death rate and exposure to disease was an acceptable cost for Stalin.  Stalins motto was that technology decides everything no matter at what cost.  After Peters death, in 1929 the Soviet Union launched the Five-Year Plan, a list of economic goals that was designed to strengthen the economy.Three of the monumental projects in the early Five-Year Plans were the building of the worlds largest hydroelectric plant on the Dnieper River, the construction of the worlds largest steel plant (Magnitogorski) and the digging of the White Sea Canal.  These Soviet industrialization projects were greatly flawed and wasteful, costing many people who worked both voluntarily and involuntarily their lives.USSR Engineering Disasters from The Ghost of the Executed Engineer http://www.rpi.edu/~eglash/eglash.dir/design.dir/day1/soviet.htm1. Dnieper Dam Power PlantMany engineers, including Peter Palchinsky warned the USSR not to rush and go ahead with the building of the dam.  They argued that the water flow was ultimately going to be too slow and no good studies had been made of the flow patterns of surface and underground water in the area.  Ultimately, 10,000 farmers were forced out of their farmland with little or no compensation, and those who did not volunteer to work on the project were forced to do so.  As the project proceeded, it fell behind on schedule and grossly exceeded the estimated costs.  Worker needs were neglected and they lived and worked under unbearable conditions.  Destroyed and rebuilt twice after World War II, it has been expanded several times and is still in operation today as one of six hydroelectric dams on the Dnieper River.2. Magnitogorsk (Steel City)Construction began in 1929 at the site of one of the countrys richest iron deposits, known as Magnetic Mountain.  Peter Palchinsky published articles in 1926 and 1927 complaining that the Soviet government  was going ahead with plans for the construction of the mining plant without adequate studies of geological resources, availability of labor, economics of transportation and supplying proper housing for the work force.  Workers were promised a garden city away from industry and instead got barracks with open sewers directly in the path of blast furnace fumes.In 1987 Kotkin was the first American to live in Magnitogorsk and found a dirty and dispirited city surrounding hopelessly obsolescent steel mills, far from the garden city anyone expected.3. Sea CanalThe building of the White Sea Canal was described as a complete nightmare.  It ignored the engineering principles of Palchinsky and was also an obscene violation of human rights.  Almost all workers were prisoners and more than 200,000 died during construction.  The Canal would freeze half the year, and water was too low in the dry summers.  The Canal failed to live up to its specifications from the beginning. After World War II, the entire canal was rebuilt, running parallel to the first one. References 1. John, Redford (1996-02).

Neath_and_Brecon_Railway
The Neath and Brecon Railway linked the Vale of Neath Railway at Neath with the and Merthyr Railway at Brecon and also via a connection from Colbren Junction, it linked to the Swansea Vale Railway at Ynysygeinon Junction (sometimes spelt Ynisygeinon).The southern section from Onllwyn to Neath is still open to goods traffic, although passenger services ceased from October 1962 and the northern section lifted under the Axe as the coal industry wound down.RouteThe railway was authorised by an of Parliament on 29 July 1862(http://www.swansea.gov.uk/westglamorganarchives/index.cfm?articleid13523&articleactionprint) as the Dulais Valley Mineral Railway to transport coal from the  Valley to Neath. It was promoted and constructed by the contractor John Dickson. After being authorised to extend the railway to Brecon, it changed its name to the Neath and Brecon Railway. The railway linked itself to the Vale Railway by promoting the Swansea Vale and Neath and Brecon Junction Railway. This line had a long gestation period due to Dicksons bankruptcy but eventually when it was opened it gave the Neath and Brecon access to Swansea via running rights. In return, the Neath and Brecon gave full running rights over its system to the Swansea Vale Railway. The Neath and Brecon started operating a passenger service between Brecon and Swansea using these running rights.An early and unsuccessful purchaser of the new Fairlie locomotive, when in 1863 the railway reached Crynant, coal mining quickly expanded.(Neath Port Talbot Museum Service - All For Coal) At Crynant several new mines were opened including the Crynant colliery, Brynteg colliery in 1904, Llwynon colliery in 1905, Dillwyn colliery, and Cefn Coed colliery 1930. These mines led to the expansion of the village.(http://www.swansea.gov.uk/westglamorganarchives/index.cfm?articleid13542&articleactionprint)BreconWhen the railway reached Brecon in 1867, it provided access to the Brecon and Merthyr, the Mid Wales, and the Hereford, Hay and Brecon Railways which were all completed about this time. The initial B&M station at Brecon was at the Watton and the N&B had a station at Mount Street. The Hereford, Hay and Brecon, after belonging to the empire of Savin (originally a draper from Oswestry who became a railway contractor, promoter and operator), was leased and then taken over by the Midland Railway who, by using running powers over the Mid Wales from Three Cocks Junction, gained access to Brecon.The Midland then leased the Swansea Vale Companys line from around 1874 and in so doing obtained the use of the SVRs running powers over the N&B. This enabled them start running trains from Brecon to Swansea. At around the same time the N&B abandoned its Brecon - Swansea service and decided to lease its main line north of Colbren to the Midland in return for an annual fee. This situation remained in force until around 1930 when the LMS (the 1923 successor to the Midland) decided to abandon its through Swansea Brecon services when the N&B line (then part of the Great Western Railway) was taken back by its owners and rather than being a through route, reverted to being something of a backwater.The three companies providing services to Brecon consolidated their stations at a newly rebuilt Free Street Joint Station from 1871.(Victorian Brecon - railway stations)Gradual winding downIn October 1962, all passenger services were withdrawn from Neath to Brecon, leaving only freight services. The line north of Craig y Nos/Penwyllt station closed to Brecon on closure of Brecon station, and remained open south until 1977 to serve the adjacent quarry.(cyn.JPG :: Craig y Nos/Penwyllt Station looking north on 14th April 2006. The Neath & Brecon line to this point lingered on to serve the adjacent quarry until 1977 (officially closed 1981)) The line remains open to Onllwyn, with Energy using the coal washing plant there through partnership with Welsh and Scottish Railway.(onll1.JPG :: More Neath & Breconry.

Northeast_megalopolis
Northeast megalopolis along the northern Atlantic coast of the United StatesThe Northeast megalopolis or BostonWashington megalopolis is the heavily urbanized area of the States stretching from the southern suburbs of D.C. to the northern suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. On a map, the region appears almost as a perfectly straight line. As of 2000, the region supported 49.6 million people, about 17% of the U.S. population on less than 2% of the nations land area, with a population density of 931.3 people per square mile (359.6 people/km2), compared to the U.S. average of 80.5/mi2( John Rennie Short, Liquid City: Megalopolis and the Contemporary Northeast, (Washington, DC, Resources for the Future, 2007), p. 23) (31 people/km2). America 2050 projections expect the area to grow to 58.1 million people by 2025.(http://www.america2050.org/northeast.html)() French geographer Gottmann coined the term megalopolis to describe a massive urban region in his 1961 book Megalopolis: The Urbanized Northeastern Seaboard of the United States, his landmark study of the region. His conclusion was that the various cities contained in the regionespecially D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, York City, and Bostonare, while discrete and independent, uniquely tied to each other through the intermeshing of their suburban zones, acting in some ways as a unified super-city: a megalopolis. Since the publication of Gottmanns book, the concept has gained prominence in both popular and academic media. Region The megalopolis encompasses the District of Columbia and part or all of eleven states: from south to north, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Jersey, York, Connecticut, Island, Massachusetts, Hampshire, and Maine. It is linked by 95 and Route 1, which start in Miami and West, Florida, respectively, and terminate in Maine at the States border. It is home to over 50 million people.(The region accounts for 20% of the U.S. Domestic Product.()  The region is home to the York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, the House and States Capitol, the headquarters of the United Nations, and the headquarters of ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, the New York Times Company, Today,  and Washington Post. The headquarters of many major financial companiessuch as State Street, Citigroup, and Fidelityare located within the region, which is also home to 54 of the Global 500 companies.  The headquarters of 162 of the Fortune 500 are in the region.(http://www.bafuture.org/news/railways/building-america%E2%80%99s-future-chairmen-bloomberg-and-rendell-testify-developing-high-speed) The region is also the center of the global fund industry, with 47.9% of $2.48 trillion of hedge fund assets being managed in its cities and suburbs.(http://www.hedgefundintelligence.com/images/590/55595/Global%20hedge%20fund%20assets%20$2.48trillion.pdf) Similarly, the majority of the global private equity, venture capital, investment banking, and management consulting industries are centered and/or headquartered in this region.Academically, the region is home to six of the eight League universities (the exceptions being Dartmouth and the Cornell main campus (the medical school, being in New York City)), as well as many other major universities.   Population Statistical Areas (CSAs) within the Northeast megalopolis(Excerpted from of United States Combined Statistical Areas) History thumb|222px|right|A satellite view of the megalopolitan region at nightThe Eastern coast of the United States of America, due to its proximity to Europe, was among the first regions of the continent to be widely settled by Europeans. Over time, the cities and towns founded here had the advantage of age over most other parts of the US. However, it was the Northeast in particular that developed most rapidly, owing to a number of fortuitous circumstances.While possessing neither particularly rich soil nor exceptional mineral wealth, the region is well-suited enough to support some levels of both agriculture and mining.(Jean Gottmann, Megalopolis: The Urbanized Northeastern Seaboard of the United States, (New York: The Twentieth Century Fund, 1961), 8) The climate is also temperate and not given to hurricanes or storms, which was increasingly the case the further South the colonists went . However, the most important factor was the interpenetration of land and sea,(Gottmann, Megalopolis, p. 81-82) which makes for exceptional harbors, such as those at Bay, the of New York and New Jersey, the of Providence, and Harbor. The coastline to the North is rockier and less sheltered, and to the South is smooth and does not feature as many bays and inlets that function as natural harbors. Also featured are a large number of navigable rivers that lead deeper into the heartlands. Therefore, while other parts of the country exceeded the region in raw resource value, they were not as easily accessible, and often, access to them necessarily had to pass through the Northeast first.By 1800, there were four cities in the United States that had populations of over 25,000: Philadelphia, New York, Baltimore, and Boston, all within the region. By 1850, New York and Philadelphia alone had over 300,000 residents, while Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, and Orleans had over 100,000: four were within one 400-mile strip, while the last two were each four hundred miles away from the next closest metropolis. The immense concentration of people in one relatively densely-packed area gave that region considerable sway through population density alone over the rest of the nation, which was solidified when Washington, DC, only 35 miles southwest of Baltimore, was made the capital in 1800. According to Gottmann, capital cities will tend to create for and around the seats of power a certain kind of built environment, singularly endowed, for instance, with monumentality, stressing status and ritual, a trait that will increase with duration.(Jean Gottmann, Since Megalopolis: The Urban Writings of Jean Gottman, ed. Robert A. Harper, (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990) 63-64) The transportation and telecommunications infrastructure that the capital city mandated also spilled over into the rest of the strip.Additionally, the proximity to Europe, as well as the prominence of Island as an immigrant processing center, made New York especially but also the cities nearby a landing wharf for European immigrants, who represented an ever-replenished supply of diversity of thought and determined workers.( Gottmann, Megalopolis, 45) By contrast, the other major source of trans-oceanic immigrants was China, which was significantly farther from the USs West Coast than Europe was from the East, and whose ethnicity made them targets of racial discrimination, creating barriers to their seamless integration into American society.By 1950, the region held over a fifth of the total U.S. population, with a density nearly 15 times that of the national average.( Short, Liquid City, p. 23)ConceptGottmann wrote his most famous work, Megalopolis, around the central theory that the cities between Washington, DC and Boston, MA together form a sort of cohesive, integrated supercity. He took the term Megalopolis from a small Greek town that had been settled in the Classical Era with the hopes of spanning all of Greece in a massive urban sprawl; though it still exists today, it is just a sleepy agricultural community. The dream of the founders of the original Megalopolis, Gottmann argued, was being realized in the Northeastern U.S. in the 1960s.( Gottmann, Megalopolis, 4)Gottmann defined two criteria for a group of cities to be a true megalopolis: polynuclear structure and manifold concentration: that is, the presence of multiple urban nuclei, which exist independently of each other yet are integrated in a special way relative to sites outside their area.To this end, twin cities such as Paul in Minnesota would not be considered a megalopolitan area since both cities are fairly integrated with each other even though both cities have distinct city borders and large central business districts.   Large communities on the outskirts of major cities, such as Silver Spring or Bethesda in Maryland outside of Washington, DC, are clearly distinct areas with even their own downtowns. However, they are not truly independent of their host city, being still considered suburbs that would almost certainly not have developed in the ways that they have without the presence of Washington.On the other hand, while the major cities of the BostonWashington megalopolis all are distinct, independent cities, they are closely linked by transportation and telecommunications. Neil Gustafson showed in 1961 that the vast majority of phone calls originating in the region terminate elsewhere in the region, and it is only a minority that are routed to elsewhere in the United States or abroad.( Gottmann, Megalopolis, 583-593) Business ventures unique to the region have sprung up that capitalize on the interconnectedness of the megalopolis, such as airline shuttle services, that operate short flights between Boston-New York and New York-Washington that leave every half-hour;(Jeff Clabaugh, Washington Business Journal, July 18, 2002 http://washington.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2002/07/15/daily45.html)(See also Shuttle, Airways Shuttle) and the bus lines, which offer economy transportation between the cities Chinatowns and elsewhere. Other bus lines operating exclusively in the megalopolitan area owned by national or international corporations have also arisen in recent years, such as BoltBus and Megabus. The National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Amtrak, offers high-speed service only from Washington to Boston, via its Express service. These ventures indicate not only the dual independent nuclei/interlinked system nature of the megalopolis, but also a broad public understanding of and capitalization on the concept.Among examples of academic acceptance of Gottmanns Megalopolis concept, John Rennie Short authored a major update to Gottmanns book in 2007, Liquid City: Megalopolis and the Contemporary Northeast. The Geographic Society released a map in 1994 of the region at the time of the Revolutionary War and in present day, which borrowed Gottmanns books title and referred to him by name. Senator Pell wrote a full-length book entitled Megalopolis Unbound in 1966, which summarized and then expanded on the original book to outline his vision for a cohesive transportation policy in the region (of which his state, Rhode Island, is part). Futurists Kahn and Anthony Wiener coined the term BosWash in 1967 in their predictions concerning the area described by Gottmann as Megalopolis.()Use in fictionThe immensity of the megalopolis, and the idea that it might one day form an actual uninterrupted city, has inspired several authors and has resulted in extrapolations of the current megalopolis appearing in fiction. Examples include Gibsons trilogy, which envisions a future Boston-Atlanta Metropolitan Axis known as Sprawl, and the even larger Quebec-Florida One from the Dredd comic book series.See also*Statistical Area*Conurbation*(city type)*of the United States References do Nordeste dos Estados Unidosmegalopolis

Lapal_Tunnel
status            Closedright|thumb|1955 Ordnance Survey map of the west portal of tunnelright|thumb|1955 Ordnance Survey map of the east portal of tunnelThe Lapal Tunnel (old spelling Lappal Tunnel) is a disused  canal tunnel on the five mile dry section of the Dudley No. 2 Canal in the West Midlands, England.The narrow brick-lined tunnel, built in 1798 by William Underhill, had no towpath. It had a very fine bore - at 7 feet 9 inches, just wider than the boats which used it, with headroom of only 6 feet. Boats originally took about three hours to complete the passage by legging or poling, so in 1841 a steam engine was built at the Halesowen end which drove a scoop wheel to load the tunnel with water. Stop gates could be opened at either end to assist boats along the tunnel in either direction.The tunnel suffered many collapses and after a collapse in 1917 due to mining subsidence was abandoned. It runs under Lapal, the motorway near junction 3 and Valley Country Park. The canal either side of the tunnel is also disused and has been filled in as the tunnel was considered uneconomic to repair.RestorationThe Canal Trust was concerned with restoring the lost canal to make it navigable up to the tunnel from both Halesowen and Oak, and had a longer term aim of restoring the tunnel. In May 2007 the trust received recommendations from professional consultants, Atkins, that the tunnel should not be restored but replaced by a new up-and-over alignment instead.Points of interest(precise OS ref from 6 map) At western end of track opposite Lapal Cottage, Lapal Lane South(calculated)(precise OS ref from 6 map) Buried under grass slopeSee also*Tunnel*of canal tunnels in Great BritainReferences*Birminghams Canals, Ray Shill, 1999, 2002, ISBN 0-7509-2077-7*Lapal Canal Trust  Restoration of the Dudley No. 2 Canal between Halesowen and Selly Oak*Lapal Canal Trust - History of No 2 canal*British Waterways map of Dudley No. 2 Canal*Nicholson waterways Guide 2 - Severn, Avon and Birmingham, Collins, 2006 ISBN 978-0-00-721110-4

Old_Settlers_Song_(Acres_of_Clams)
Old Settlers Song (Acres of Clams) is a Northwest United States song written by Francis D. Henry around 1874. The lyrics are sung to the tune Rosin the Beau. The song also goes by the names Acres of Clams, Lay of the Old Settler, Old Settlers Song, while the melody is known as Rosin the Beau, Old Rosin, the Beau, Rosin the Bow, Mrs. Kenny, A Hayseed Like Me, My Lodgings on the Cold, Cold Ground.The first recorded reference to this song was in the Washington newspaper the Washington Standard in April 1877.  Although no official record exists, The Old Settlers Song was thought to be the state song of Washington according to the The Peoples Song Bulletin until it was decided the lyrics were not dignified enough.()The song achieved prominence decades later when radio-show singer Haglund used it as the theme song for his Washington radio show. Seeger and Guthrie said that they taught the song to Haglund. Haglund went on to name the Seattle restaurant Ivars Acres of Clams after the last line from the ballad.( )LyricsVersion 1:Ive wandered all over this country, :Prospecting and digging for gold, :Ive tunneled, hydraulicked and cradled, :And I nearly froze in the cold. :And I nearly froze in the cold, :And I nearly froze in the cold, :Ive tunneled, hydraulicked and cradled, :And I nearly froze in the cold. :For one who got wealthy by mining, :I saw many hundreds get poor, :I made up my mind to go digging, :For something a little more sure, :For something a little more sure,:For something a little more sure.:I made up my mind to go digging,:For something a little more sure.:I rolled up my grub in my blanket, :I left all my tools on the ground, :I started one morning to shank it, :For the country they call Puget Sound,:For the country they call Puget Sound,:For the country they call Puget Sound.:I started one morning to shank it, :For the country they call Puget Sound.  :No longer a slave of ambition, :I laugh at the world and its shams, :And I think of my happy condition, :Surrounded by Acres of Clams, :Surrounded by Acres of Clams, :Surrounded by Acres of Clams. :And I think of my happy condition, :Surrounded by Acres of Clams.Version 2:Ive traveled all over this country:Prospecting and digging for gold:Ive tunneled, hydraulicked and cradled:And I have been frequently sold.:For each man who got rich by mining:Perceiving that hundreds grew poor:I made up my mind to try farming:The only pursuit that was sure.:So, rolling my grub in my blanket:I left all my tools on the ground:I started one morning to shank it:For the country they call Puget Sound.:Arriving flat broke in midwinter:I found it enveloped in fog:And covered all over with timber:Thick as hair on the back of a dog.:When I looked on the prospects so gloomy:The tears trickled over my face:And I thought that my travels had brought me:To the end of the jumping-off place.:I staked me a claim in the forest:And sat myself down to hard toil:For two years I chopped and I struggled:But I never got down to the soil.:I tried to get out of the country:But poverty forced me to stay:Until I became an old settler:Then nothing could drive me away.:And now that Im used to the climate:I think that if a man ever found:A place to live easy and happy:That Eden is on Puget Sound.:No longer the slave of ambition:I laugh at the world and its shams:As I think of my pleasant condition:Surrounded by acres of clams.Lay of the Old Settler version:Ive traveled all over this country:Prospecting and digging for gold;:Ive tunneled, hydraulicked and cradled,:And I have been frequently sold ::And I have been frequently so-o-old,::And I have been frequently sold:::Ive tunneled, hydraulicked and cradled,::And I have been frequently sold!
