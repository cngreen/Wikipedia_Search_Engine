The system was developed in the 1980s by Finnlines, another Finnish shipping company that also managed the vessels until 2003, in co-operation with Rautaruukki to transport raw materials to the Raahe Steel Works. Two pushers and five barges, four of which remain in service, were delivered by Hollming in 19861987.  the Finnpusku system consists of pushers Rautaruukki and Steel, and barges Board, Botnia, Kalla and Tasku. Concept Separating the expensive machinery section from the cargo space offers several advantages in comparison to conventional vessels, one of the most important being the ability to operate on the drop and swap principle which minimizes the turnaround time in port for the pusher and its crew. When a pusher-barge combination arrives at a port, the fully laden barge is left for unloading while the pusher picks up an empty one and leaves again. In theory the system works on optimum efficiency when there are as many barges as there are pushers and ports of call  the barges are always either being loaded or unloaded, or underway with a pusher. In addition to reducing unprofitable waiting time such operation principle allows more time for the unloading of the barge, removing the need for expensive cargo handling equipment in the unloading port.((Eriksson, U. Puskuproomujrjestem. FG-Shipping Oy Ab, 1991.)One of the major arguments in favor of integrated tug barge systems is the small number of crew required to operate such vessel(  whereas a conventional vessel with capacity in par with the Finnpusku pusher-barge combination would require a crew of 1617, the integrated tug-barge unit can be operated by a crew of only 9.( In some cases an integrated system is adopted only for this reason and the pusher is rarely, if ever, decoupled from the barge.(An integrated system has several technical advantages in comparison to towed barges. Traditionally tugs, being short in length, have to operate at relatively high numbers resulting in high making resistance and the barges, being towed in the tugs wake, have skegs that improve directional stability but increase drag. Positioning the tug behind behind the barge in a stern notch improves the hydrodynamic efficiency of the combination, resulting in significant reductions in the total resistance. In addition the tug, operating in the wake of the barge, has better control over the combination and thus improves seaworthiness and maneuverability in comparison to the traditional towing arrangement.(van Leeuwen, W.A. Tug/barge systems - An economical alternative for the short-sea. Schip en Werf de Zee, 4-92.)Integrated tug barge systems are generally divided into three generations by the type of coupling. In the first generation systems the tug is connected to the barge by wires or chains. However, because the two vessels are subject to different motion responses due to their shape, displacement and position on a wave, such operation is only possible in calm sea conditions  in rough weather the tug has to disconnect from the barge and continue the journey by towing it in a traditional way.( The second generation systems are designed with a deeper stern notch and improved coupling devices to allow operation in heavier seas while still permitting relative motion between the two vessels. The third generation systems such as the Finnpusku system, equipped with rigid or articulated mechanical coupling, allow operation in all sea states and even in ice conditions as the pusher-barge combination behaves hydrodynamically like a conventional ship.( However, in some cases the specialized hull form of the pusher, designed to form a streamlined hull when coupled to the barge, might lead to problems with stability and seakeeping when the pusher is operated independently.(Integrated Tug Barge (ITB) / Tug/Barge Unit (TBU). GlobalSecurity.org. ) Development and construction The history of the Finnpusku integrated tug barge system dates back to 1964 when Rautaruukki started steel production in the new mill in Raahe, Finland, and began supplying the factory with concentrate, coal, coke and other raw materials.(von Bruun-Riegels, U. Raaka-ainekuljetukset proomuilla. Rautaruukki Oy, 1991.) Around the same time the Finnish shipping company Finnlines researched transporting cargo by barges and developed the first version of the Finnpusku system, but due to problems in funding and the devaluation of the markka in 1967 the idea was not pursued further. However, an upgraded concept was developed in the 1970s.(Holma, H. Proomukuljetukset. Oy Finnlines Ltd, 1972.)By the end of the 1970s it was realized that as the iron mines in Finland would soon be exhausted and there would not be enough suitable ice-strengthened tonnage to guarantee a continuous supply of raw materials for the expanding steel works. The draught of the bulk carriers available in the market exceeded the water depth of the port of Raahe and unloading the ships would have required a large number of cranes. While transporting the raw materials by barges proved to be feasible as they had low draught and could be unloaded with loaders, towed barges could not be used during the winter and their poor maneuverability made them unsuitable for the confined waterways. For this reason it was decided to investigate if it would be possible to design a pusher-barge system that could also be operated in ice conditions.(When Rautaruukki consulted Finnlines that already operated the steel companys conventional bulk carrier Rautaruukki, the shipping company immediately presented the integrated tug barge system it had developed in the 1970s, the Finnpusku system. A development contract was signed and Finnlines performed several feasibility studies which showed that a pusher-barge system would be the most economical and efficient method of transporting bulk cargoes on the relatively short routes of the Baltic Sea.(( The initial plan was to establish shipping companies for each vessel under the joint ownership of several large Finnish industrial and shipping companies, including Rautaruukki and Finnlines, that would own and operate the Finnpusku system. However, due to delays in negotiations Rautaruukki, concerned about the continuous supply of raw materials to the Raahe Steel Works, decided to order one pusher and two barges for itself and signed a building contract with Hollming on 27 September 1984. A follow-up order for another pusher and three more barges was signed on 14 March 1985 by joint shipping companies formed by Effoa Oy (20 %), Oy Finnlines Ltd (16 %), Hollming Oy (10 %), Neste Oy (25 %), Palkkiyhtym Oy (10 %), Oy Paratug Ltd (5 %), Rautaruukki Oy (9 %) and Thomesto Oy (5 %). All vessels were managed and manned by Finnlines.( While the pushers were built completely in Finland, to reduce the building costs the steel work of the barges was subcontracted to a Portuguese shipyard Navais de Setubal in Setbal, from where they were towed to Hollming for outfitting.(Mauno, J. Finnpusku minimoi satama-ajan. Navigator 11/86.) The total price of the Finnpusku system was FIM 300 million (US$61 million).( The first pusher, Rautaruukki, and two barges, Kalla and Tasku, were delivered to Rautaruukki on 31 October 1986( and the second pusher, Finn, and barges Baltic, Board and Bulk to the joint shipping companies Puskija, Proomu I, Proomu II and Proomu III on 28 April 1987.(Finnpuskut valmiit. Navigator 9/87.) It was estimated that the two pushers and five barges of the Finnpusku system would carry one third of the ten million tons of bulk cargo arriving in Finland by sea every year.( Technical details  Combination File:Rautaruukki-botnia 20110207.jpg|thumb|left|Pusher Rautaruukki with the barge Botnia outside Raahe, Finland, with the Steel Works in the background.A Finnpusku pusher-barge combination consists of one pusher vessel and one barge. The overall length of the combination is  and its breadth and draft at summer load line are that of the barge,  and , respectively.( However, in the water of the Baltic Sea it can be loaded to a maximum draught of . During ballast legs the pusher maintains its normal draught while the barge is ballasted to a draught of  to reduce the displacement from 20,930 tons to 17,630 tons. In such loading condition the main deck of the barge is at the same level with the pushers gunwale.( The tonnage of the combination is that of the pusher and barge combined, 10,620 GT, 3,184 NT and 14,447 DWT.(The combination is classified by Norske Veritas with a class notation of +1A1, Pusher/Barge Unit, Ice IA+. It has the highest Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1A Super, which means that it is designed to operate in difficult ice conditions mainly without icebreaker assistance.( When the Finnpusku system entered service in the mid-1980s, its icegoing capability was superior to most conventional bulk carriers.(Finnpusku uses a unique rigid coupling system, Marine Locomotive, which consists of two hydraulic locking pins, one on each side of the pusher, and one fixed pin in the bow. When connected, the hydraulic pins exert a transverse force of 450 tons to the sockets, forcing the jaws of the barge apart by , and the angled faces of the coupling pins push the pusher forwards, resulting in a longitudinal force, also of 450 tons, at the bow pin.( The three-point connection removes all degrees of freedom and results in the combination behaving hydrodynamically like a single ship, allowing unrestricted service and independent operation in the severe ice conditions of the Gulf of Bothnia.( The pusher can be connected to the barge at three different levels, removing the need to ballast the barge to the same draught as the pusher when not carrying cargo. In addition to mechanical coupling the pusher is connected to the barge by several electrical cables on the starboard side and flexible pipes on the port side. The latter allow the pushers fuel and freshwater tanks to be topped up from the much larger storage tanks of the barge.(Onnettomuustutkintakeskus: Puskija FINNin ja proomu BALTICin kaatuminen Hangon edustalla 27.12.1990)The combination of a pusher and a barge is usually referred to by using the names of both vessels, e.g. Rautaruukki-Board. Pushers Initially there were two pushers in the Finnpusku system, Rautaruukki and Finn, built by Hollming in 1986 and 1987, respectively. After capsizing in 1990 Finn was rebuilt and returned to service as Steel in 1991.( In 1991 Herakles, a tug built in 1967 and owned by Finnish towing and salvage company Hkans, was converted to a pusher and chartered to Rautaruukki as the third pusher of the Finnpusku system. After the conversion the Herakles was chartered to Rautaruukki and continued to operate as part of the transport system until her demise in 3 March 2004 when she sank with the barge Bulk near Swedish Grundkallen lighthouse in the Sea.( Rautaruukki and Steel File:Steel 20090719.jpg|thumb|right|Pusher Steel without a barge in the port of Raahe. The Marine Locomotive coupling devices are visible in the hull behind the superstructure.: Main articles: (pusher) and (pusher)The pushers of the Finnpusku system are  long and have a breadth of  at the waterline and  at the bridge wings.(STEEL. DNV Exchange. ) The draught and depth to upper deck,  and  respectively, are the same as those of a fully laden barge.(One of the most prominent features of the pushers is the high superstructure rising  from the waterline. In addition to accommodation, mess and dayroom for the crew of nine, it initially housed two bridges at different levels. The lower bridge on the third deck was originally intended to be used when the pusher is operating on its own without a barge, allowing more comfortable conditions for the crew  the chairs in the upper bridge on the seventh deck were equipped with seatbelts due to the large motions of the vessel when operating independently. However, the lower bridge was rarely used and the space was later rebuilt for other use in both pushers. The upper bridge, with bridge wings extending beyond the pushers breadth, is equipped to allow one man bridge operation.(Propulsion power is provided by two six-cylinder Sulzer 6ZAL40 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines running on heavy fuel oil, manufactured under licence by Wrtsil, each with a maximum continuous output of  at 380 rpm, giving the combination a service speed of 13.4 knots.((Rohkea investointi. Navigator 11/84) A Lohmann & Stolterfoht reduction gearbox connects the main engines to a propeller shaft driving a 4.7-metre () four-bladed Rauma-Repola Liaaen propeller( and a 900 kVa Strmberg shaft generator used to power the bow thruster. The main engines are equipped with steam-generating exhaust boilers to improve the overall efficiency of the power plant.(Puskija on tehokas tymyyr. Tekniikan Maailma, 16/2008.) Electricity is provided by two Wrtsil-Vasa 4R22HF diesel engines, each producing  at 1,000 rpm, that are connected to 710 kVa Strmberg alternators. The auxiliary generating sets are mounted side by side above the propeller shaft due to the narrow hull.( A 158 kW Penta TMD102A emergency generator is located on the main deck level in the smoke stack.(While usually connected to a barge, the pushers are also capable of operating independently. However, the low height of the vessels, only , results in large roll amplitudes and pitching, making the pushers very uncomfortable in severe weather.( For this reason short transit journeys without a barge are done only when it is absolutely necessary.( Herakles When salvage tug Herakles was converted to a pusher, a new wheelhouse was installed on top of a cylindrical pillar  above the old superstructure, the hull was modified to accept the coupling devices, additional diesel generator was installed to power the bow thruster of barge and propulsion and steering gear was upgraded. The conversion also included refitting the existing barges with new coupling devices since Herakles, having considerably smaller breadth than the original Finnpusku pushers and a different hull shape, was incompatible with the original rigid three-point Wrtsil Marine Locomotive coupling. The Herakles and the barges were fitted with Japanese Articouple K articulated coupling system that allowed free pitching of the tug relative to the barge.(Articouple & Triofix (Taisei Engineering Consultants, Inc.): Coupler Reference List - 3 (Nos. 81-120). )(Description of the conversion. Navamec Oy.) Being considerably less powerful than Rautaruukki and Steel, Herakles received new main engines and propellers in 1995. While the engine output was nearly doubled to 4060 kW, she remained underpowered in comparison with the original Finnpusku pushers. She also had a lower Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1B.( Barges The barges of the Finnpusku system were built in two series, Kalla and Tasku in 1986 and Baltic, Board and Bulk in 1987. Their hulls were constructed by the Portuguese shipyard Estaleiros Navais de Setubal and towed to Hollming in Rauma for outfitting. Of these Baltic was renamed Botnia after capsizing and Bulk sank along with pusher Herakles in 2004. Hull and machinery As the Finnpusku system is designed to operate independently in the severe ice conditions of the Sea, special attention has been paid to the hull form. The spoon-shaped bow has a low stem angle to reduce icebreaking resistance and the sides of the barge are flared to prevent the combination from becoming immobilized by ice ridges and compressive ice fields.( When the pusher is coupled to the barge, the deep stern notch forms a streamlined aftship with seakeeping characteristics similar to those of conventional ships.(When coupled, the power for the ramps, pumps, floodlights and other equipment onboard the barge is taken from the pusher. When the power cables on the starboard side of the pushers superstructure are disconnected, a 200 kVA Volvo Penta TD100CRC generating set starts automatically and provides power to operate the equipment when the barge is left alone for loading or unloading. To increase maneuverability in ports the barges are equipped with a 680 kW controllable-pitch bow thruster which is powered by the pushers shaft generator.( Cargo space The barges of the Finnpusku system are of the so-called deck cargo type, meaning that the cargo is carried on the main deck in an open cargo space instead of closed holds as in conventional carriers. The cargo space, surrounded by coamings  high, has a free area of  and a total volume of . The total cargo carrying capacity is about 13,400 tons. Bulk cargo is loaded either by shiploaders or cranes, but while the cargo deck is strengthened for grab discharging, the barges are also equipped with two side ramps to facilitate faster discharging by wheel loaders and trucks. This more efficient method also removes the need to invest in discharging equipment in the unloading port. The ramps are  long, have a free driving width of  and are strengthened for axle loads up to .((There are some differences between the first and the second series of barges. The first two were built with lower side coamings due to the limited clearance under the loader at the port of Lule. When the Finnpusku system was developed, the volume enclosed by the fixed coamings was included in the tonnage of the barge by the rules regarding ship measurement, so to minimize this the side coamings in Kalla and Tasku consisted of removable cassettes held in place by vertical supports. However, the rules were later changed so that none of the open deck was included in tonnage assessment, so the last three barges had their cassettes welded in place. The second series was also originally designed with higher coamings all around to increase capacity for cargo with low factor, such as coal, but restrictions placed by the cargo handling equipment of the ports resulted in a compromise with lower coamings forward of the side ramps and higher towards the aft.((Since the cargo is open to the elements, there are four drainage pipes and six storm shutters, gravity-closed hatches opened by internal water pressure, on both sides of the barge to remove water from the cargo space. These are often covered by cargo, so the forward part of the barge Bulk was equipped with a retractable, air-filled cloth cover to protect the cargo from the water splashing over the bow in heavy weather. Due to problems especially during the winter months it was later removed and not installed on the other barges.((As the cargo is carried on the main deck, the barges have considerable tank capacity belowdecks. In addition to 12,413.75 m3 of ballast water in the side tanks and 12,304 m3 of void space in the middle of the barge there are tanks for 592.66 m3 of heavy fuel oil that can be used to replenish the fuel tanks of the pusher, 82.05 m3 of marine diesel oil for the pushers auxiliary engines and the barges own generator and 82.05 m3 of freshwater.( Career After the last vessels of the Finnpusku integrated tug barge system entered service in 1987, the barges owned by different companies were operated interchangeably and when the transportation department of Rautaruukki required additional capacity, it time-chartered the second pusher owned by the joint shipping company. Although the main purpose of the Finnpusku system was to supply the Raahe Steel Works with raw materials from various ports of the Baltic Sea, such as limestone from the port of Storugns in Gotland, iron ore concentrate from Lule, Sweden, and coal from European ports,( the jointly owned pusher and barges were also used for other cargoes such as lumber by the owner companies and, to reduce the number of southbound ballast legs, the pusher-barge combinations carried occasional iron ore concentrate and pellet cargoes from Lule to various ports in the Baltic Sea for the Swedish mining company LKAB.(By the end of 1987 the amount of cargo transported by the Finnpusku system, 7.5 million tons per year, had grown beyond the capability of the transportation department that was under the central administration of the steel company. It was decided to replace it with a subsidiary company that would inherit the responsibilities and obligations of the transportation department and deal with both the parent companys own cargoes and external shipping business. The new company, JIT-Trans, was established on 1 May 1988.(Due to the difficulties in the timing of the transportation needs of Rautaruukki and Finnlines the time-chartering of the second pusher did not fulfill the requirements of the steel companys raw material supply schedule. It was decided to transfer the ownership of the pusher Finn and barges Baltic, Board and Bulk to new joint shipping companies owned by Rautaruukki Oy (95 %) and Oy JIT-Trans Ltd (5 %). Once all vessels were under the control of a single company, these issues disappeared and the Finnpusku system was found out to be suitable for the transportation needs of Rautaruukki in both port-to-port transport and lightening large bulk carriers outside the port of Raahe.(In 1989 JIT-Trans signed a long-term contract with SSAB for the transportation of iron ore concentrate and pellets from Lule to Oxelsund. Since Finland and Sweden had no reciprocity agreement for cabotage, part of the Finnpusku system had to be transferred to the Register of Ships. Rautaruukki sold pusher Rautaruukki and barges Kalla and Tasku to new joint shipping companies formed by the Finnish companies Swedish subsidiaries and half of its shares in the other joint shipping companies to Dalsbruk, another Finnish steel company. Despite the changes in ownership and flag Finnlines retained the management of the vessels through its Swedish subsidiary.(In the 1990s the ownership of the pushers and barges was transferred to a Finnish financial institution Suomen Asiakasrahoitus (later known as Merita Rahoitus and nowadays as Nordea Rahoitus)(Finnish Maritime Administration: The Finnish merchant marine 1994.) and by 1996 all vessels of the Finnpusku system were again under the Finnish flag.()File:Rautaruukki and Tasku in Helsinki on 26 June 2011.jpg|thumb|Rautaruukki and Tasku at Helsinki Shipyard on 26 June 2011.In July 2003 a seven-year contract for the transportation of raw materials in the Baltic Sea, worth 140 million euros, was signed between JIT-Trans and Aspo Group. As part of the agreement, the ownership and management of the Finnpusku system was transferred to ESL Shipping, a subsidiary of the Aspo Group.(Rautaruukki ja ASPO kehittvt yhteistyt raaka-aineiden merikuljetuksissa. Rautaruukki Oyj, prssitiedote, 30.7.2003.) Under the new owner the vessels have occasionally carried other cargo as well, including coal to the Power Plant in Helsinki.(Steel - IMO 8503503. Photograph in ShipSpotting.com by Pekka Laakso. 2008.) In February 2011 ESL Shipping signed a new long-term contract with Rautaruukki for the transportation of the raw materials of the steel industry in the Baltic Sea. The pushers and barges of the Finnpusku system will be docked at Helsinki Shipyard and modernized by STX Finland Lifecycle Services during the summer of 2011.(ESL Shipping and Rautaruukki signed a long-term contract for sea transport. ESL Shipping Ltd, 2011-02-20. ) In addition to basic maintenance and machinery overhaul the outdated SELMA automation system in all six vessels will be upgraded and the cargo deck plating in the barges, damaged after years of elevator loading and grab discharging, will be replaced.(Sabell, T. STX Finlandin Elinkaaripalvelut modernisoi ESL Shippingin puskuproomukaluston. Ohoi! STX Finland - Henkilstlehti, nro 13/30.6.2011.) The Rautaruukki arrived at the shipyard in late June and the Steel in mid-August.While the Finnpusku system has been criticized for its constant need of icebreaker assistance during the winter months especially on the RaaheLule -route and replacing the vessels with new icebreaking cargo ships to free 12 icebreakers was proposed by the Maritime Administration in 2007, the pusher-barge combinations remain in year-round service in the Baltic Sea after more than two decades.(Vesivylien kunnossapito. Valtiontalouden tarkastusviraston toiminnantarkastuskertomus 182/2009. Page 37.) Accidents There have been two serious accidents involving the vessels of the Finnpusku system, one resulting in the loss of eight lives and the other in the total loss of the pusher-barge combination. Finn-Baltic Pusher Finn capsized along with the barge Baltic outside Hanko, Finland, on 27 December 1990 at around 12:25 (UTC+02). The pusher-barge combination Finn-Baltic was en route from Raahe to Koverhar with 13,398 tons of A Fines (MAF) iron ore concentrate when the cargo shifted in heavy weather, resulting in the loss of stability and the vessel capsizing in 1015 seconds. Seven crew members and a pilot lost their lives in the accident, but the engineer and officer survived in an air pocket in the aftmost part of the engine room and were later rescued through a hole cut in the bottom.(The Finn-Baltic was rightened two months later by a Soviet ship Yudin and towed to Rauma for rebuilding.( The pusher returned to service in 1991 as Steel and the barge as Botnia.( Herakles-Bulk Herakles sank along with the barge Bulk on 3 March 2004 at around 00:30 (UTC+02) in the Bothnian Sea. The combination had left Oxelsund two days earlier and was heading north with the barge fully laden with coal. On 2 March she ran into a storm and the captain, not certain if the vessel could be safely turned around in such conditions to seek shelter closer to the coast, decided to evacuate half of the crew by helicopter. When the port engine began overheating and later the starboard engine lost all power, the combination was no longer able to keep the bow into the wind and began to drift uncontrollably in the storm. The remaining crew was soon evacuated and shortly afterwards Herakles-Bulk foundered in the shallows near the Swedish Grundkallen lighthouse.(Tyntproomuyhdistelm HERAKLES-BULK, vaaratilanne ja uppoaminen Selkmerell 2.3.3.2004.

10th_Arizona_Territorial_Legislature
The 10th Arizona Territorial Legislative Assembly was a session of the Territorial Legislature which convened on January 6, 1879, in Prescott, Arizona Territory.(McClintock p. 371)The session was the last to be composed of nine Council members and eighteen members of the House of Representatives.(McClintock pp. 333, 371)BackgroundThere had been several significant changes to the territorial government since the prior session.  First, the territorial capital was moved from Tucson to Prescott.(McClintock p. 330)  Second, Governor P.K. Safford had declined a third term to seek his fortune in a number of mining projects.(Wagoner p. 117)  Territorial Secretary Philo Hoyt had been named to replace Safford on April 5, 1877.(Goff p. 66)  Then, in 1878, C. Frmont used his political connections to displace Hoyt and secured the governorship for himself.  While Hoyt was well respected, most Arizonans were thrilled to have such a well known personality as their Governor.(Goff p. 77)The Pacific Railroad had reached Yuma on September 30, 1877, providing the first rail service to the territory.  They were at the time of the session building eastward across Arizona.(Wagoner p. 162)Legislative sessionThe legislative session began on on January 6, 1879.Governors addressGovernor Frmont gave his address to the session on January 9, 1879.(Goff p. 78) In it he spoke to the potential for development within the territory.(Wagoner p. 169)  To this end he recommended spending US$500,000 on construction of new roads.(Wagoner p. 169)  He also proposed using the River to irrigate the territorys deserts.(Goff p. 78)To assist the territorys mining industry, the governor asked for creation of a territorial office and proposed a refinery be built in Prescott to reduce the expense of transporting raw bullion to Francisco.(Wagoner p. 169)LegislationGovernor Frmonts proposals were largely ignored by the session.  They instead dealt primarily with issues affecting only individuals or limited sections of the territory.(Wagoner p. 171)  To this end an Omnibus Divorce Bill was passed which ending the marriages of fifteen couples.(McClintock p. 331)  Separate bills granted divorces to two other couples.(McClintock pp. 331-2)  Other legislation granted changes to eight people.(Wagoner p. 171)Gambling was another popular topic.  An Arizona Lottery, patterned after the Louisiana Lottery, was created.  Proceeds of this lottery were supposed to offset the expense of constructing schools and other public buildings.(Wagoner p. 172)  A US$300 per quarter fee for gambling licenses, half payable to the county the other to the territory, was also imposed.(Wagoner p. 171)  Less serious was a bill presented by Representative J. D. Rumberg of Maricopa County, who had apparently lost a large wager on a slow pony, that would prohibit racing within the territory.(Wagoner p. 172)  Other members of the House of Representatives, realizing the proposal was likely made in jest, solemnly reported their counties were not prepared for the change and had the restriction limited to Rumbergs home county.(McClintock p. 332)  Representative John Alsap, also from Maricopa County, then obtained further revisions that limited the prohibition to just Rumbergs ranch.(Wagoner p. 172)  While the bill was passed by the session the resulting law was never published.(McClintock p. 332) From the eastern section of Yavapai County was created Apache County.(Wagoner p. 58)Finally, the session authorized US$2000 for Governor Frmont and Judge Silent to travel to D.C., and lobby to have an order by Secretary of the Interior Schurz extending boundaries of the Gila River Indian Reservation into the Salt River Valley.(Wagoner p. 174)MembersReferences* * *

Sindika_Dokolo
Sindika Dokolo (born 16, 1972 in Kinshasa, Zaire)(Biography of Sindika Dokolo on Pitigrili (English/Portuguese)) is a Congolese arts collector and businessman. He is the husband of businesswoman dos Santos from Angola.(GeneAll.net: Sindika Dokolo)He was brought up in Belgium and France by his parents, selfmade man, bank owner, millionaire and passionate for arts, Dokolo(Biography of Augustin Dokolo) and his Danish wife Hanne Kruse.(GeneAll.net: Hanne Taabbel Kruse) He attended the Lyce Saint-Louis-de-Gonzage in Paris from which he graduated, later he studied economics, commerce and languages at the and Marie Curie University in Paris.In 2003 he married Isabel dos Santos, the eldest daughter of Eduardo dos Santos, President of Angola. The wedding, a 4 million-dollar party with 1000 guests, was one of the largest weddings in the history of the country. To the big surprise by the ordinary people in Angola, a large number of guests were flown into Luanda by special chartered aeroplanes from Portugal and France, without visas having been issued previously. Promoting African arts Through Sindika Dokolos father initiative, he started an arts collection at the age of 15. In 1995 he decided to return to then Zaire to join the large - in total 17 companies consisting family business - (banking, breeding, fishing, coffee exportation, real estate, consumer goods distributor, merchandise conveyance, printing, insurance, mining and car selling).(The Dokolo companies) The country collapsed and their activity couldnt survive. Sindika took in hand the family business. These family businesses were later nationalized by the then Government of Zaire in 1986 under former head of state Sese Seko.Later he started the Sindika Dokolo Foundation (Portuguese: Fundao Sindika Dokolo) in order to promote numerous arts and culture festivals at home and abroad. Its mission is to create a center for contemporary art in Luanda, in the display, and not only pieces of contemporary African art, but also create the conditions and activities which are necessary to integrate African artists in the international circles of the art world.(Homepage Sindika Dokolo Foundation) Sindika Dokolo started expositions like the SD Observatorio (July 2006 - August 2006) at the Valencia Institute of Modern Art in Valencia (Spain), the Trienal de Luanda (December 2006 - March 2007) in Luanda, or the Check List Luanda Pop (June 2007 - November 2007) at the 52nd Biennale, Venice (Italy). This event caused heavy irritations among visitors and experts, due to Sindika Dokolos acquisition of a large African arts collection from the widow of German collector Bogatzke. It took place under mysterious circumstances for just 600.000 Dollars, however, but this was estimated to be 3 times the value.(Biennal of Venice: Controversy around the Collection Sindika Dokolo (Portuguese))  On January 25, 2009 was following a huge exposition to the 434. anniversary of Luanda, called Luanda Suave e Frentica, with many artists reflecting on various ways about a vibrant and smooth city. Business Sindika Dokolo is also doing business in Angola. He is member of the board of the Angola cement company Cimangola,(Klub-K about Nova Cimangola, 3rd paragraph April 26, 2010 (Portuguese)) but more importantly, he acquired the exploration rights for diamonds from a subsidiary of Endiama, the Angola state company for mining concessions.(Endiama subsidiary sells exploration rights to Angolan presidents son-in-law February 14, 2011) Sindika Dokolo is also member of the board of Energia that owns a third of Portuguese petrol company Galp through Esperanza Holding BV.(Global witness: Link between Angolan presidents son-in-law and state oil company raises questions about transparency March 15, 2010)Sindika Dokolo lives in Luanda.

Wembley Stadium plays host to The FAs flagship events including all senior England home internationals, The FA Cup Final and Semi Finals, The Community Shield and The FA Carlsberg Vase and Trophy Finals.  According to Duncan White of Sunday Telegraph, Keith Harris is arguably the most influential man in British football. As happy chatting to his good mate Terry Venables as he is swapping canaps with City blue bloods, says Andrew Davidson in The Times. Harris welcomed Roman Abramovich at Chelsea Village, ushered Randy Lerner into Villa Park, and handled Thaksin Shinawatras purchase of Manchester City and the takeover of West Ham by Eggert Magnusson. Mike Ashley previously appointed him to handling the sale of Newcastle United and Bill Kenwright has asked him to find a billionaire buyer for Football Club.In May 2011, Seymour Pierce has advised Sports Holdings (Asia) Limited on the sale of the entire issued share capital of Portsmouth Football Club to Convers Sports Initiatives, a group controlled by London-based Russian businessman Antonov.Seymour PierceSeymour Pierce is the number one ranked investment bank in London for Stock Exchange AIM listed companies.() Seymour Pierce is a registered Nominated Advisor, or NOMAD, with authority delegated by the London Stock Exchange to regulate and supervise companies admitted to trade publicly on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) segment of the LSE.

In 2010, he advised an unnamed Middle Eastern client on the attempted acquisition of football club.(http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/46162/20100825/liverpool-football-club-keith-harris-george-gillett-tom-hicks-yahya-kirdi-rhone-group-al-kharafi-fam.htm) He has acted for numerous other Middle Eastern clients from several countries in the region.

The bank has long roots in the region, having acquired The British Bank of the Middle East in 1959 (now called HSBC Bank Middle East Limited) which was established in London in September 1889 originally as the Imperial Bank of Persia.Red KnightsIn 2010, a cabal of Britains leading businessmen calling themselves the Red Knights met at the offices of Bruckhaus Deringer, the law firm, to attempt to remove Glazer, the clubs owner. The group then met with Keith Harris, a Manchester United fan and the chairman of investment bank Seymour Pierce, in order to broker a takeover.() Mr Harris, a life long Manchester United fan, joined as a member of the Red Knights consortium of financiers that sought to buy the club from the Glazer family, the controversial American owner of the football club.The leading figures of the Red Knights are Jim ONeill, a former HSBC investment bank chief executive and chief economist at Goldman Sachs; Seymour Pierces Keith Harris; Paul Marshall, a partner at the hedge fund Marshall Wace; Richard Hytner of advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi and lawyer Mark Rawlinson, a partner in Freshfields corporate practice, who advised United during the Glazer takeover negotiations.(Who are the Red Knights? BBC)Self-professed United fan Harris claimed the group wants to do something for the good of Manchester United and the good of football. In the past, he has been involved in the takeovers of West Ham, Manchester City and Aston Villa, but last year, he correctly predicted that footballs finances were set for a crash, and has been extremely critical of the debt-burden the Glazers have brought to Manchester United.EducationDr. Harris obtained his Doctorate in Economics in 1977 and embarked on a career in investment banking.

Conformance_checking
Conformance checking is a mining technique that takes an existing process model and compares it with an event log of the same process.(Process Mining Webpage (www.processmining.org)) Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa. For instance, there may be a process model indicating that purchase orders of more than one million Euro require two checks. Analysis of the event log will show whether this rule is followed or not. Another example is the checking of the socalled four-eyes principle stating that particular activities should not be executed by one and the same person. By scanning the event log using a model specifying these requirements, one can discover potential cases of fraud. Hence, conformance checking may be used to detect, locate and explain deviations, and to measure the severity of these deviations.OverviewUnlike discovery, conformance checking takes both a model and event log as a starting point. While conducting a conformance check the behavior of a process model and the behavior recorded in an event log are compared to find commonalities and discrepancies. Such analysis may result in global conformance measures (e.g., 85% of the cases in the event log can be replayed by the model) and local diagnostics (e.g., activity x was executed 15 times although this was not allowed according to the model). The interpretation of non-conformance depends on the purpose of the model. If the model is intended to be descriptive, then discrepancies between model and log indicate that the model needs to be improved to capture reality better. If the model is normative, then such discrepancies may be interpreted in two ways. Some of the discrepancies found may expose undesirable deviations, i.e., conformance checking signals the need for a better control of the process. Other discrepancies may reveal desirable deviations. For instance, workers may deviate to serve the customers better or to handle circumstances not foreseen by the process model.Techniques and MetricsMost conformance checking techniques are based on the principle of Replay, i.e., the event log is replayed on the process model. For example, while replaying an event log on a Petri net, one can count the number of missing and remaining tokens. Alternatively, one can try to optimize the mapping of traces onto models by introducing costs associated to skipping, ingnoring, or swapping events in the log and/or model. Typical conformance metrics are:* Fitness. A model with good fitness allows for the behavior seen in the event log. A model has a perfect fitness if all traces in the log can be replayed by the model from beginning to end. There are various ways of defining fitness. It can be defined at the case level, e.g., the fraction of traces in the log that can be fully replayed. It can also be defined at the event level, e.g., the fraction of events in the log that are indeed possible according to the model.* Simplicity. The simplicity dimension refers to Razor.  In the context of process mining this means that the simplest process model that can explain the behavior seen in the log, is the best model. The complexity of the model could be defined by the number of nodes and arcs in the underlying graph. Also more sophisticated metrics can be used, e.g., metrics that take the structuredness or entropy of the model into account.* Fitness and simplicity alone are not adequate as metrics. The process model may be overfitting or underfitting.References(Further reading* Aalst, W. van der (2011). Process Mining: Discovery, Conformance and Enhancement of Business Processes.

Monchegorsky_District
Monchegorsky District () was an administrative division (a district) of Okrug of Oblast, and later of Oblast of the SFSR, Union, which existed in 19381949.HistoryThe work settlement of Monchegorsk in the 1930s was the center of copper and nickel mining in the Massif of the Peninsula, and was administratively a part of Kirovsky District of Okrug.(Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 49) By 1937, the copper-nickel mining volume increased significantly, and, consequently, the area population grew as well.(Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 5154) On February 19, 1937 the Presidium of the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee petitioned to create new Monchegorsky District by separating the town and its surrounding area from Kirovsky District and to grant Monchegorsk town status.( While town status was granted to Monchegorsk by the VTsIK Resolution of September 20, 1937, no new district was formed.( On October 10, 1937, Monchegorsk town council was subordinated directly to the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee.(On December 21, 1937, the Presidium of the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee again petitioned to create a new district with the administrative center in Monchegorsk.( In a letter to the Leningrad Oblast Executive Committee and the VTsIK, the Presidium noted that Kirovsky District has two developed but unrelated industrial centersKirovsk and Monchegorskwith the latter having a larger population and being located  away from the former.( The petition was again unsuccessfulwhen on February 10, 1938 the VTsIK adopted a new Resolution changing the administrative-territorial structure of Oblast (of which Murmansk Okrug was a part), Monchegorsk remained a part of Kirovsky District.(On May 16, 1938, the VTsIK finally issued a Resolution to create Monchegorsky District in Murmansk Okrug of Leningrad Oblast on the territory of the town of Monchegorsky and Selsoviet.( However, since Murmansk Okrug itself was abolished only a few days later on May 27, 1938, the district had not been formed and even the Resolution itself had not been published.(Monchegorsky District was eventually formed by the VTsIK Resolution of December 27, 1938, after the creation of Murmansk Oblast.( It existed until December 9, 1949, when by the Decree of the Presidium of the Council of the Soviet Union Monchegorsk was elevated in status to that of a town under oblast jurisdiction, with the former districts territory passing into its subordination.(ReferencesNotesSources*

The_Product_Space
The Product Space is a network that formalizes the idea of relatedness between products traded in the global economy. The network first appeared in the July 2007 issue of Science in the article The Product Space Conditions the Development of Nations,(C.A. Hidalgo, B. Klinger, A.-L. Barabsi, R. Hausmann, Science 317 (2007).) written by Hidalgo, Bailey Klinger, Hausmann, and Barabsi. The Product Space network has considerable implications for economic policy, as its structure helps elucidate why some countries undergo steady economic growth while others become stagnant and are unable to develop.BackgroundConventional economic development theory has been unable to decipher the role of various product types in a countrys economic performance.(A. Hirschman, The Strategy of Economic Development (Yale University Press, New Haven, CT, 1958).)(P. Rosenstein-Rodan, Econ. J 53, 202 (1943).)(K. Matsuyama, J. Econ. Theory 58, 317 (1992).) Traditional ideals suggest that industrialization causes a spillover effect to new products, fostering subsequent growth. This idea, however, had not been incorporated in any formal economic models. The two prevailing approaches explaining a countrys economy focus on (a) the countrys relative proportion of capital and other productive factors(E. Heckscher, B. Ohlin, Heckscher-Ohlin Trade Theory, H. Flam, M. Flanders, Eds. (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1991).) or (b) differences in technological capabilities and what underlies them.(P. Romer, J Polit. Econ. 94, 5 (1986).) These theories fail to capture inherent commonalities among products, which undoubtedly contribute to a countrys pattern of growth. The Product Space presents a novel approach to this problem, formalizing the intuitive idea that a country which exports bananas is more likely to next export mangoes than it is to export jet engines, for example.The forest analogyThe idea of the Product Space can be conceptualized in the following manner: consider a product to be a tree, and the collection of all products to be a forest. A country consists of a set of firmsin this analogy, monkeyswhich exploit products, or here, live in the trees. For the monkeys, the process of growth means moving from a poorer part of the forest, where the trees bear little fruit, to a better part of the forest. To do this, the monkeys must jump distances; that is, redeploy (physical, human, and institutional) capital to make new products. Traditional economic theory disregards the structure of the forest, assuming that there is always a tree within reach.  However, if the forest is not homogeneous, there will be areas of dense tree growth in which the monkeys must exert little effort to reach new trees, and sparse regions in which jumping to a new tree is very difficult. In fact, if some areas are very deserted, monkeys may be unable to move through the forest at all.  Therefore, the structure of the forest and a monkeys location within it dictates the monkeys capacity for growth; in terms of economy, the topology of this product space impacts a countrys ability to begin producing new goods.Building the Product SpaceThere exists a number of factors that can describe the relatedness between a pair of products: the amount of capital required for production, technological sophistication, or inputs and outputs in a products value chain, for examples. Choosing to study one of these notions assume the others are relatively unimportant; instead, the Product Space considers an outcome-based measure built on the idea that if a pair of products are related because they require similar institutions, capital, infrastructure, technology, etc., they are likely to be produced in tandem.  Dissimilar goods, on the other hand, are less likely to be co-produced. This a posteriori test of similarity is called proximity.The concept of proximityThe Product Space quantifies the relatedness of products with a measure called proximity. In the above analogy, proximity would imply the closeness between a pair of trees in the forest. Proximity formalizes the intuitive idea that a countrys ability to produce a product depends on its ability to produce other products: a country which exports apples most probably has conditions suitable for exporting pears: the country would already have the soil, climate, packing equipment, refrigerated trucks, agronomists, phytosanitary laws, and working trade agreements. All of these could be easily redeployed to the pear business. These inputs would be futile, however, if the country instead chose to start producing a dissimilar product such as copper wire or home appliances. While quantifying such overlap between the set of markets associated with each product would be difficult, the measure of proximity uses an outcome-based method founded on the idea that similar products (apples and pears) are more likely to be produced in tandem than dissimilar products (apples and copper wire). The RCA is a rigorous standard by which to consider competitive exportation in the global market. In order to exclude marginal exports, a country is said to export a product when they exhibit a Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) in it. Using the Balassa(B. Balassa, The Review of Economics and Statistics 68, 315 (1986).) definition of RCA, x(c,i) equals the value of exports in country c in the ith good. If the RCA value exceeds one, the share of exports of a country in a given product is larger than the share of that product in all global trade. Under this measure, when RCA(c,i) is greater than or equal to 1, country c is said to export product i. When RCA(c,i) is less than 1, country c is not an effective exporter of i. With this convention, the proximity between a pair of goods i and j is defined in the following way::\phi_{i,j}  \min\{\Pr(R C A x_i \mid R C A x_j), \Pr(R C A x_j \mid R C A x_i)\}\Pr(RCA_i \mid RCA_j) is the conditional probability of exporting good i given that you export good j. By considering the minimum of both conditional probabilities, we eliminate the problem that arises when a country is the sole exporter of a particular good: the conditional probability of exporting any other good given that one would be equal to one for all other goods exported by that country.Source dataThe Product Space uses international trade data from Feenstra, Lipset, Deng, Ma, and Mos World Trade Flows: 1962-2000 dataset,(R.R. Feenstra, H.D. Lipsey, A. Ma, H. Mo, HBER Work. Pap 11040 (2005).) cleaned and made compatible through a Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) project. The dataset contains exports and imports both by country of origin and by destination. Products are disaggregated according to the Standardized International Trade Code at the four-digit level (SITC-4). Focusing on data from 1998-2000 yields 775 product classes and provides for each country the value exported to all other countries for each class. From this, a 775-by-775 matrix of proximities between every pair of products is created.Matrix representationEach row and column of this matrix represents a particular good, and the off-diagonal entries in this matrix reflect the proximity between a pair of products. A visual representation of the proximity matrix reveals high modularity: some goods are highly connected and others are disconnected. Furthermore, the matrix is sparse. Five percent of its elements equal zero, 32% are less than 0.1, and 65% of the entries are below 0.2. Because of the sparseness, a network visualization is an appropriate way to represent this dataset.The Product Space networkA network representation of the proximity matrix helps to develop intuition about its structure by establishing a visualization in which traditionally subtle trends become easily identifiable.Maximum spanning treeThe initial step in building a network representation of product relatedness (proximities) involved first generating a network framework. Here, the maximum spanning tree (MST) algorithm built a network of the 775 product nodes and the 774 links that would maximize the networks total proximity value.Network layout The basic skeleton of the network is developed by imposing on it the strongest links which were not necessarily in the MST by employing a threshold on the proximity values; they chose to include all links of proximity greater than or equal to 0.55. This produced a network of 775 nodes and 1525 links. This threshold was chosen such that the network exhibited an average degree equal to 4, a common convention for effective visualizations. With the framework complete, a force-directed spring algorithm was used to achieve a more ideal network layout. This algorithm considers each node to be a charged particle and the links are assumed to be springs; the layout is the resulting equilibrium, or relaxed, position of the system. Manual rearranging untangled dense clusters to achieve maximum aesthetic efficacy.Node and link attributesA system of colors and sizing allows for simultaneous assessment of the network structure with other covariates. The nodes of the Product Space are colored in terms of product classifications performed by Leamer(E. Leamer, Sources of Comparative Advantage: Theory and Evidence (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1984).) and the size of the nodes reflects the proportion of money moved by that particular industry in world trade. The color of the links reflects the strength of the proximity measurement between two products: dark red and blue indicate high proximity whereas yellow and light blue imply weaker relatedness.Properties of the Product SpaceIn the final Product Space visualization, it is clear that the network exhibits heterogeneity and a core-periphery structure: the core of the network consists of metal products, machinery, and chemicals, whereas the periphery is formed by fishing, tropical, and cereal agriculture. On the left side of the network, there is a strong outlying cluster formed by garments and another belonging to textiles. At the bottom of the network, there exists a large electronics cluster, and at its right mining, forest, and paper products. The clusters of products in this space bear a striking resemblance to Leamers product classification system, which employed an entirely different methodology. This system groups products by the relative amount of capital, labor, land, or skills needed to export each product. The Product Space also reveals a more explicit structure within product classes. Machinery, for example, appears to be naturally split into two clusters: heavy machinery/vehicles and electronics. Although the machinery cluster is connected to some capital-intensive metal products, it is not interwoven with similarly classified products such as textiles. In this way, the Product Space presents a new perspective on product classification.Dynamics of the Product SpaceThe Product Space network can be used to study the evolution of a countrys productive structure. A countrys orientation within the space can be determined by observing where its products with RCA>1 are located. The images at right reveal patterns of specialization: the black squares indicate products exported by each region with RCA>1.  It can be seen that industrialized countries export products at the core, such as machinery, chemicals, and metal products. They also, however, occupy products at the periphery, like textiles, forest products, and animal agriculture. East Asian countries exhibit advantage in textiles, garments, and electronics. Latin America and the Caribbean have specialized in industries further towards the periphery, such as mining, agriculture, and garments. Sub-Saharan Africa demonstrates advantage in few product classes, all of which occupy the product space periphery. From these analyses, it is clear that each region displays a recognizable pattern of specialization easily discernible in the product space.Empirical diffusionThe same methods can be used to observe a countrys development over time: how has the set of products in which it has advantage changed? By using the same conventions of visualization, it can be seen that countries move to new products by traversing the Product Space. Two measures quantify this movement through the Product Space from unoccupied products (products in which a given country has no advantage) to occupied products (products in which that country has an RCA>1). Such products are termed transition products.The density is defined as a new products proximity to a given countrys current set of products::\omega_j^k  \frac{ {\displaystyle \sum_i x_i \phi_{ij} } }{ {\displaystyle\sum_i \phi_{ij} } }A high density reflects that a country has many developed products surrounding the unoccupied product j. It was found that products which were not produced in 1990 but were produced by 1995 (transition products) exhibited higher density, implying that this value predicts a transition to an unoccupied product. The discovery factor measurement corroborates this idea: :H_j  \frac{ {\displaystyle \sum_{k1}^T \omega_j^k / T} }{ {\displaystyle \sum_{kT+1}^N \omega_j^k / (N - T)} }H_j reflects the average density of all countries in which the jth product was a transition product and the average density of all countries in which the jth product was not developed. For 79% of products, this ratio exceeds 1, indicating that density is likely to predict a transition to a new product.Simulated diffusionThe impact of Product Spaces structure can be evaluated through simulations in which a country repeatedly moves to new products with proximities above a given threshold. At a threshold of proximity equal to 0.55, countries are able to diffuse through the core of the Product Space but the speed at which they do so is determined by the set of initial products. By raising the threshold to 0.65, some countries, whose initial products occupy periphery industries, become trapped and cannot find any near-enough products. This implies that a countrys orientation within the space can in fact dictate whether the country achieves economic growth.Future workAlthough the dynamics of a countrys orientation within the network has been studied, there has been less focus on changes in the network topology itself. It is suggested that changes in the product space represent an interesting avenue for future work.(C.A. Hidalgo, B. Klinger, A.-L. Barabsi, R. Hausmann, Science 317 485 (2007).) Additionally, it would be interesting to explore the mechanisms governing countries economic growth, in terms of acquisition of new capital, labor, institutions, etc., and whether the co-export proximity of the Product Space is truly an accurate reflection of similarity among such inputs.References(

Hugh_Hastings_Romilly
Hugh Hastings Romilly (18561892) was an explorer and third son of Colonel Frederick Romilly and Elizabeth, daughter of William Elliot, third earl of Minto. He was born in London on 15 March 1856, and, at first, educated at the Rev. C. A. Johnss school at Winchester, and then at Repton. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, on 10 October 1874, but took no degree, leaving to enter the business of Messrs. Melly & Co., merchants, of Liverpool.He was of adventurous disposition, and joined in Fiji in October 1879 Sir Arthur Gordon, the governor (afterwards Lord Stanmore). On 12 November he accompanied his chief to Tonga, and, in December, to Rotumah, in connection with the annexation of that island. He arrived again in Fiji on 17 April 1880, and returned to Rotumah on 18 September 1880 as deputy-commissioner on its annexation to the British crown. In early 1881, owing to continued ill-health, he rejoined Sir Arthur Gordon, who had gone to Zealand as governor, but in March he was appointed deputy-commissioner for the Western Pacific, and started for his first long tour through these seas in H.M.S. Beagle. He visited New Hanover, the Admiralty group, Hermit Islands, Astrolabe Bay in New Guinea, the Louisiade archipelago, Woodlark Islands, and the Trobriands. After a visit on sick leave to England, succeeded by a short stay in Fiji, he was ordered to New Guinea for the first time, at the end of 1883. In November 1884 he was one of the party which declared the British protectorate over part of New Guinea. By some misunderstanding he hoisted the British flag in advance of the formal declaration of protectorate. He gave effective aid in the early administration of the new colony, and on the death of the chief administrator, Sir Scratchley, he acted as administrator in charge of the settlement from December 1885 to the end of February 1886, but went to London in June to supervise the New Guinea exhibits at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition. For these services he was created a C.M.G. On 17 Jan. 1887 he once again started for the Pacific, staying en route in Egypt and Australia, and in June took up the appointment of deputy-commissioner and consul of the New Hebrides and Solomon Islands, residing chiefly at Port Moresby, New Guinea. His task during 1888 and 1889 was peculiarly trying. There was a good deal of native hostility, and he was much isolated, owing largely, he believed, to the neglect of the home authorities. Finally, in 1890, he resigned his offices.In 1891 Romilly went out to Africa in command of an expedition for the Northumberland Mining Syndicate, and travelled for some time in Mashonaland. While there he contracted fever, and, returning home, died at Cecil Street, Strand, London, on 27 July 1892. He was unmarried.Romilly is described by Sir Arthur Gordon as of a quick intelligence, great physical strength, and an easy temper. His writings prove that he possessed all the qualifications for an explorer of new lands and a student of native ways. A portrait forms the frontispiece of the memoir by his brother, Samuel H. Romilly.Romilly published: 1. A true Story of the Western Pacific in 187980, London, 1882 (2nd edit. with portrait, 1893). 2. The Western Pacific and New Guinea, London, 1886. 3.

BiographyBorn Ruth Lwenthal in Frth (near Nuremberg) in 1924, Ruth Weiss emigrated with her parents and sister to South Africa in 1936 to escape rising German persecution. Too poor to study at a university, she became a self-taught expert on African economics by working her way up to Company Secretary at South Africa Mining and General Assurance Company, one of the few females in the upper reaches of the then male dominated industry. She taught herself journalism by assisting her partner Hans Leopold Weiss, an African correspondent in the 1950s for several German papers. She was Business Editor of Newscheck, before joining the Mail (FM). In 1966 she became FMs Bureau Chief in Salisbury (Harare), Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) but was declared persona non grata by the white regime because of her critical reporting and sanction busting stories. She moved to Guardian in London, returning in the 70s to Africa as Business Editor of the of Zambia and Zambian Financial Times correspondent. From Lusaka she moved to Cologne, Germany as an editor in the Voice of Germanys Africa-English department, before turning freelance in London in 1978. After covering the 1979 House talks on Zimbabwe, she was invited to Zimbabwe to train economic journalists and was co-founder of the Southern African Economist. From 1987 to 1991 she worked on the staff of the Zimbabwe Institute of Southern Africa (ZISA), which facilitated secret meetings of white and black South Africans, ahead of official talks, which began in 1990 and led to the dismantling of apartheid. In 1992 she wrote on the of Wight, for a decade.

All_Watched_Over_by_Machines_of_Loving_Grace_(television_documentary_series)
 followed_by  All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace is a three part BBC series() by filmmaker Curtis, well known for other documentaries including The Trap and Power of Nightmares. The first episode aired on Monday 23 May 2011 at 9pm on BBC2.()It claims that computers have failed to liberate us and instead have distorted and simplified our view of the world around us.(The title is the same as a 1967 poem and collection of poems by Brautigan.()Episodes Love and Power File:Objectivist1.jpg|thumb|right|Atlas sculpture, New York City, by sculptor Lawrie, a symbol of ObjectivismIn this episode Curtis tracks the effects of Rands ideas on American financial markets, particularly via the influence on Greenspan.Ayn Rand was born in Russia and moved to America in 1928 and worked for B. DeMille, where she got some of the plot for what became Fountainhead from this period. Later she moved to New York, and set up a reading group called The Collective where they considered her work. On advice from a friend, Greenspan (then a positivist) joined The Collective.When published, although critically savaged, Rands Objectivist ideas were popular and came to heavily infiltrate California, particularly Valley. The computer utopian belief (Ideology) that computer networks could measure, control and self-stabilise societies, without hierarchical political control, and that people could become Randian heroes, only working for their own happiness, became more widespread.Rand entered into an affair with Branden, another married person in The Collective, which she proposed to justify in terms of her value of rationality, and with the approval of his wife. After several years, the affair ended violently and was revealed to rest of The Collective, which broke up. Rand ended up alone in her New York apartment, although Greenspan continued to visit.Greenspan entered government in the 70s, and became of the Federal Reserve. In 1992 he visited the newly elected Clinton. He persuaded him to let the markets grow, cut taxes, and to let the markets stabilise themselves with computer technology, to create the Economy. This involved using computer models to predict risks and hedge against them, in accordance with the Californian Ideology. However, by 1996, the production figures had failed to increase, but profits were nevertheless increasing; and Greenspan suggested that it wasnt working. After political attacks from all side, Greenspan changed his mind and decided that perhaps the New Economy was real, but that it couldnt be measured using normal economic measures, and so the apparent boom continued.In 1994 Hermosillo published a widely influential essay online, Pandoras Vox: On Community in Cyberspace(Introducing Humdog: Pandoras Vox Redux, Folksonomy.co.), and it began to be argued that the result of computer networks had led to, not a reduction in hierarchy, but actually a commodification of personality and a complex transfer of power and information to companies.Although the miracle had led to long-term growth in South Korea and other countries Stiglitz began warning that the withdrawing of foreign financial investment from the Far Eastern economies could cause devastation there. However, he was unable to warn the president, being blocked by Rubin, who feared damage to financial interests.The Asian financial crisis began as the property bubble in the Far East began to burst in Thailand, causing large financial losses in those countries that greatly affected foreign investors. While Bill Clinton was preoccupied with the Lewinski scandal, Robert Rubin took control of foreign policy and forced loans onto the affected countries. However, after each country agreed to IMF bailout loans, foreign investors immediately withdrew their money, leaving the tax payers with enormous debts and triggering massive economic disasters.After his handling of the economic effects of 9/11 Alan Greenspan became more important, and in the wake of Enron he cut interest rates to stimulate the economy. Unusually this failed to cause inflation. It seemed that the New Economy was working to stabilise the economy.However, in reality, to avoid a repeat of the earlier collapse, Chinas Politburo had decided to manage Americas economy via similar techniques to those used by America on the other Far Eastern countries; by keeping Chinas exchange rate artificially low, they sold cheap goods to America, and with the proceeds, had bought American bonds. The money flooding into America permitted massive loans to be available to those that would previously be considered too risky. The belief in America was that computers could stabilise and hedge the lending of the money. This permitted lending beyond the point that was actually sustainable. The high level of loan defaulting led ultimately to the 2008 collapse due to a similar housing bubble that the Far Eastern countries had previously faced.Curtis ends the piece by pointing out that not only had the idea of stability failed to be borne out in practice, but that the Californian Ideology had also been unable to stabilise it; indeed the ideology has not led to people being Randian heroes but in fact trapped them into a rigid system of control from which they are unable to escape. The Use and Abuse of Vegetational Concepts This episode investigates how machine ideas such as cybernetics and systems theory were applied to natural ecosystems, and how this relates to the false idea that there is a of nature. Cybernetics has been applied to human beings to attempt to build societies without central control, organising networks built of people, based on a fantasy view of nature.Tansley had a dream where he shot his wife. He wanted to know what it meant, so he studied Freud. However, one part of Freuds theory was that the human brain was an electrical machine. Tansley became convinced that, as the brain was interconnected, so was the whole of the natural world, in networks he called ecosystems, which he believed were inherently self-stable and self correcting and which regulated nature as if it were a machine.Forrester was an early pioneer in systems, who believed that brains, cities and even societies live in networks of feedback loops that control them, and he thought that computers could determine the effects of the loops. Cybernetics therefore viewed humans as nodes in networks, as machines.The ecology movement adopted this idea also and viewed the natural world as systems as it explained how the natural system could stabilise the natural world, via natural feedback loops.Wiener laid out the position that humans, machines and ecology are simply nodes in a network in his book Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine, and this book became the bible of cybernetics.T. Odum and Odum were brothers who were both ecologists. Howard collected data from ecological systems and built electronic networks to simulate them. His brother Eugene then took these ideas to make them the heart of ecology, and the hypothesis then became a certainty. However, they had distorted the idea, and simplified the data to an extraordinary degree. That ecology was balanced became an unexamined and unscientific assumption.Meanwhile, in the 1960s Fuller invented a radically new kind of structure, the dome which emulated ecosystems by being made of highly connected, relatively weak parts. His other system based ideas inspired the movement. Communes of people considering themselves as nodes in a network, without hierarchy, and applied feedback to try to control and stabilise their societies, and used his domes as habitats. These societies mostly broke up within 3 years.Also in the 1960s Brand filmed a demonstration of a networked computer system with a graphics display, mouse and keyboard that he believed would save the world by empowering people, in a similar way to the communes, to be free as individuals.In 1967 Brautigan published the poetry work Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace which called for a cybernetic ecological utopia consisting of a fusion of computers and mammals living in perfect harmony and stability.By the 1970s new problems such as overpopulation, limited natural resources and pollution that couldnt be solved by normal hierarchical systems had arrived. Forrester stated that he knew how to solve this, and applied theory to the problem and drew a cybernetic system diagram for the world. This was turned into a computer model, which predicted population collapse. This became the basis of the model that was used by the of Rome, and the findings from this were published in Limits to Growth. Forrester then argued for zero growth, to maintain a steady state stable equilibrium within the capacity of the Earth.However, this was opposed by many people within the movement, since the model didnt allow for people to change their values to stabilise the world, and they argued that the model tried to maintain and enforce the current political hierarchy. Tansley who had invented the term ecosystem, had once accused Field Marshal Smuts of the abuse of vegetational concepts. Smuts had invented a philosophy called holism, where everyone had a rightful place, which was to be managed by white races. The 70s protestors claimed that the same conceptual abuse of the supposed natural order was occurring, that it was really being used for political control.At the time, there was a general belief in the stability of natural systems. However cracks started to appear when a study was made of predator-prey relationship of wolf and elks. It was found that wild population swings had occurred over centuries. Other studies then found huge variations, and a significant lack of homeostasis in natural systems. Van Dyne then tried to build a computer model, to try to simulate a complete ecosystem based on extensive real-world data, so as to show how the stability of natural systems actually worked. To his surprise the computer model did not stabilize like the Odums electrical model had. The reason for this lack of stabilization was that he had used extensive data which more accurately reflected reality whereas the Odums and other previous ecologists had ruthlessly simplified nature. The scientific idea had thus been shown to fail, but the popular idea remained, and even grew as it apparently offered the possibility of a new egalitarian world order.In 2003, a wave of spontaneous revolutions swept through Asia and Europe. Coordinated only by the internet, nobody seemed to be in overall charge, and no overall aims except self-determination and freedom were apparent. This seemed to justify the beliefs of the utopians.However, the freedom from these revolutions in fact lasted for only a short time. Curtis compared them with the hippie communes, all of which had broken up within three years as the powerful members of the group began to bully the weaker ones; the weaker members were unable to band together in their own defence because power structures had been prohibited by the communes rules.Adam Curtis closes the piece by stating that it has become apparent that while the self-organising network is good at organising change, it is much less good at what comes next; networks leave people helpless in the face of people already in power in the world. The Monkey In The Machine and the Machine in the MonkeyThis programme looked into the selfish gene theory which holds that humans are machines controlled by genes which was invented by William Hamilton. Adam Curtis also covered the source of ethnic conflict that was created by Belgian colonialisms artificial creation of a racial divide and the ensuing slaughter that occurred in the Republic of the Congo, which is a source of raw material for computers and cell phones.William Hamilton went to Kisangani in the Republic of the Congo while the Congo War was raging. He went there to collect Chimpanzee faeces to test his theory that HIV was due to a medical mistake. Unfortunately he caught malaria, for which he took aspirin, which caused a haemorrhage and he died. However his selfish gene theory lived on.In 1960 Congo had become independent from Belgium, but governance promptly collapsed, and towns became battle grounds as soldiers fought for control of the mines. America and the Belgians organised a coup and the elected leader was assassinated, creating chaos. The Western mining operations were largely unaffected however.Bill Hamilton was a solitary man, and he saw everything through the lens of Darwins theory of evolution. When he wanted to know why some ants and humans gave up their life for others, he went to Waterloo station and stared at humans for hours, and looked for patterns. In 1963 he realised that most of the behaviours of humans was due to genes, and looking at the humans from the genes point of view. Humans were machines that were only important for carrying genes, and that it made sense for a gene to sacrifice a human if it meant that another copy of the gene elsewhere would prosper.In the 1930s Denis made films that told the world about Africa. However, his documentary gave fanciful stories about Rwandas Tutsis being a noble ruling elite originally from Egypt, whereas the Hutus were a peasant race. In reality they were racially the same and the Belgian rulers had ruthlessly exploited the myth. But when it came to create independence, liberal Belgians felt guilty, and decided that the Hutus should overthrow the Tutsi rule. This lead to a blood bath, as the Tutsis were then seen as aliens and were slaughtered.In 1967 American R. Price went to London after reading Hamiltons little known papers and discovering that he was already familiar with the equations, that they were the equations of computers. He was able to show that the equations explained murder, warfare, suicide, goodness, spite, since these behaviours could help the genes. Von Neumann had invented self-reproducing machines, but Price was able to show that the self-reproducing machines were already in existence, that humans were the machines.This had a bad effect on Price, and Price began to believe that these equations had been given to him by God, even though the equations disproved the existence of God.In Congo, a civil war was ongoing, and Fossey, who was researching gorillas was captured. She escaped and created a new camp high up on a mountain in Rwanda where she continued to study gorillas. She tried to completely protect the gorillas who were very susceptible to human diseases, and with the best of intentions, terrorised the local people and became hated.In 1973, after converting to extreme Christianity, as a last chance to disprove the selfish gene theories gloomy conclusions Price decides to start helping poor and homeless people all his possessions in acts of pure altruism, influenced and inspired by Christian religion.In the Congo, Mobutu changed the Congos name to Zaire and looted millions of dollars and let mines and industries collapse, killed his opponents and stopped a liberal democracy from forming.While this was happening, at Fosseys camp, Digit, her favourite gorilla had been killed, and later she was too.Prices attempt to disprove Hamiltons theory had utterly failed, and he comes to believe he is being followed by the of heaven. He finally reveals, in his suicide note, that these acts of altruism brought more harm than good to the lives of homeless people.Dawkins took the equations and popularised them and explains that humans are simply machines controlled by the selfish genes; and in a sense reinventing the soul, but as computer code in the form of the genes.In 1994 the ruling Hutu government set out to eradicate the Tutsi minority. This was explained as incomprehensible ancient rivalry by the Western press. In reality it was due to the Belgian myth created during the colonial rule. Western agencies got involved, and the Tutsi fought back creating chaos. Many flooded across the border into Zaire, and the Tutsi invaded the refuge camps to get revenge. Mobutu fell from power. Troops arrived from many countries, allegedly to help, but in reality to gain access to the countrys natural resources, used to produce consumer goods for the west. 4.5 million people died.Hamilton by this point was well-honoured. However, by now he supported eugenics. He heard a story that HIV had been created from an accident with a polio vaccine, which it was thought could have been infected with a chimp virus. This supported his idea that modern medicine could be negative as he thought medicine opposed the logic of the genes. So he travelled to eastern Congo to look for the virus, through the midst of the murder and chaos. He died, and later research disproved the idea that HIV had come from a medical accident.Curtis ends the piece by saying that Hamiltons ideas that humans are computers controlled by the genes have been accepted. But he asks whether we have accepted a fatalistic philosophy that humans are helpless computers to explain and excuse the fact that, as in the Congo, we are unable to improve and change the world.Interviews and reviewsIn May 2011, Adam Curtis was interviewed about the series by Viner in the Guardian,()by the Register()and by Little Atoms.()Sam Wollaston at the Guardian reviewed the first episode and stated that he no idea whether any of it was right but that it was a fun ride that bombards you in waves and leaves you feeling bewildered and a little bit giddy.()Gee at the Telegraph said that what Adam Curtis reveals is the dangers of human beings at their most selfish and self-satisfying. Showing no compassion or consideration for your fellow human beings creates a chasm between those able to walk over others and those too considerate  or too short-sighted  to do so.() John Preston also reviewed the first episode, and said that although it showed flashes of brilliance it had an infuriating glibness too as the web of connectedness became ever more stretched. No one could dispute that Curtis has got a very big bite indeed. But what about the chewing, you ask. There wasnt any  or nothing like enough of it to prevent a bad case of mental indigestion.()Anthony published a review in Observer and The Guardian, and commented on the central premise that we had been made to believe we could create a stable world that would last for ever but that he doesnt recall ever believing that we could create a stable world that would last for ever, and noted that: For the film-maker there seems to be an objective reality that a determined individual can penetrate if he is willing to challenge the confining chimeras of markets and machines. Forget the internet tycoons. The Randian hero is Curtis himself.()MusicCurtis style is exemplified by frequent and often incongruous cuts of film and music, often lasting only a fraction of a second, a technique similar to sampling.

Capnellene
 StdInChIKey  JBALFIAUMTYBHR-NZBPQXDJSA-N| Section2  | Section3  }}Capnellene is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon derived from Capnella imbricata, a species of soft coral found in Indonesia. Since the 1970s, capnellene has been targeted for synthesis by numerous investigators due to its stereochemistry, functionality, and the interesting geometry of the carbon skeleton. Many alcohol derivatives of capnellene have demonstrated potential as a chemotherapeutic agent with antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties.Structure9(12)-capnellene, also referred to simply as capnellene in the literature, is a monounsaturated hydrocarbon of the molecular formula C15H24. It features a tricyclic skeleton, a geminal dimethyl group, a tertiary methyl group, and an exocyclic methylene group.Capnellene is also a sesquiterpene, a class of terpenes that are natural semiochemicals. However, it is a non-isoprenoid sesquiterpene, meaning that unlike most sesquiterpenes its structure is not based on a repeated isoprene unit. Capnellene is the presumed biosynthetic precursor to the capnellanols, a group of alcohols based on the capnellene skeleton that are also produced by Capnella imbricata, however the biosynthesis of these compounds has not yet been elucidated.()()HistoryThe capnellane group became a focal point for synthesis in the 1970s and 80s. Scientists believed that these compounds had antimicrobial properties, based on an earlier discovery of antimicrobial activity in gorgonian corals() and a later study of antimicrobial terpenoid compounds in alcyonarians.() It was also postulated that capnellenes also protect the soft coral by preventing larval settlement.(Capnella imbricata is a rich source of many non-isoprenoid sesquiterpenes, which all share the cis,anti,cis-tricyclo6.3.0.02,6undecane ring system.()  Consequently, the first known isolation of a capnellane derivative was not capnellene but a capnellanol.  As part of an ongoing search for terpenoids from marine sources, Kaisin et al. (1974)() characterized the most abundant terpenoid, 9(12)-capnellene-3,8,10-triol, from colonies of Capnella imbricata.  The structure and configuration of the triol were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and later confirmed by crystallography.() Kaisin et al. (1974)( coined the name capnellane for the hydrocarbon skeleton on which the molecule was based.  However, Shiekh et al. (1976)() also claim to have originated the name. The first isolation of the hydrocarbon form, 9(12)-capnellene, was achieved in 1978.() Since then, numerous groups have isolated both 9(12)-capnellene and its alcohol derivatives.Natural IsolationNaturally occurring alcohol derivatives of capnellene have been isolated using simple acetone extraction() from Capnella imbricata, a species of soft coral (order Alcyonacea) known as Kenya Tree Coral. Capnella is a widely distributed genus of soft coral, found primarily in the tropical reefs of Indonesia.()   These corals produce a variety of sterols, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes. Specifically, the capnellanol derivatives found in Capnella serve as a defense system by inhibiting the growth of microorganisms and the settlement of larvae on the corals surface.()  However, the details of this defense mechanism have not been extensively explored. Although the natural synthesis of capnellene and its derivatives is not yet understood, the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon precapnelladiene has been isolated from the same coral and research suggests that may be a biogenetic precursor.()SynthesisCapnellene has been a popular target for synthesis due to its molecular architecture, its role in the defense mechanism of soft corals, and the challenge posed by the high degree of functionalization, stereochemical sophistication, and the complexity of the undecane skeleton.((() In 1981, the first stereocontrolled synthesis of ()-9(12)-capnellene was performed in nine steps, with an overall yield of 60%.(Stevens and Paquette, 1981) Their starting reagent was a dimethylated cyclopentenyl carboxaldehyde and the overall synthesis took the form of a series of pentane ring annulations. The second pentane ring was formed by condensation of the aldehyde by vinylmagnesium bromide, followed by cyclization of the dienone.  A regiospecific 3+2 cyclopentannulation, using ozonolysis and an intramolecular condensation, formed the third ring and a simple dehydration reaction yielded the target capnellene.Since the first synthesis, many investigators have successfully assembled capnellene and its derivatives. Approaches to this synthesis are diverse, and include central steps such as annululation, metathesis, cyclization, and trapping reactions.((((()() The most heavily cited synthesis in the literature involves two key intermediates formed by a reaction, the palladium-catalyzed coupling of vinyl triflate with vinyl stannane.() The readily prepared trimethylcyclopentanone can be converted into vinyl triflate, which is coupled with vinylstannane in the first palladium-catalyzed step to yield the desired divinyl ketone. The second 5-membered ring is formed via Nazarov cyclization, and the product is prepared for a second palladium-catalyzed coupling. This step yields another divinyl ketone, which can be cyclized to an enone, hydrated, and converted to an alkene via olefination to yield capnellene. ApplicationsSince the 1960s, marine organisms with robust chemical defense systems have been targeted for molecular mining, a method of drug discovery that probes organisms of interest for useful compounds.()  Chemical agents involved in the defense systems of these organisms often exhibit antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and chemotherapeutic properties. Capnellene derivatives and their terrestrial counterparts, hirsutanes, demonstrate antibacterial and antitumor properties with pharmacological potential.(Antitumor PropertiesCapnellene-8,10-diol and its acylated derivatives exhibit significant cytotoxicity vitro against cervical epitheloid carcinoma (Hela), oral epidermoid (KB), medulloblastoma (Daoy) and colon adenocarcinoma (WiDr) human tumor cell lines.() The diol was also effective against human leukemia, renal leiomyoblastoma, colon and cancer cell lines.() In the same study, capnellene-8-ol demonstrated selective toxicity for the renal leiomyoblastoma and cancer cell lines, while 3-acetoxycapnellene-8,10,14-triol was active against leukemia cell lines. The antitumor properties of capnellene derivatives have yet to be explored vivo.Anti-Inflammatory PropertiesCapnellene derivatives have recently been identified as possible treatments for pain. Neuropathic pain is characterized by damage to peripheral or central nerves that results in pathological nociceptive transmission, the neuronal process that responds noxious stimuli. Two capnellene derivatives 9,12-capnellene-8,10-diol and 8-acetoxy-9,12-capnellene-10-ol demonstrate potential as analgesics capable of attenuating neuropathic pain. These compounds have been shown in vivo to reduce two proteins that mediate inflammation, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible oxide synthase (iNOS).() In vivo, 9,12-capnellene-8,10-diol inhibited hyperalgesia behavior in the mouse model for neuropathic pain in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, treatment with 9,12-capnellene-8,10-diol inhibited the up-regulation of immunoreactivity in the mouse model, specifically targeting the production of COX-2.() Unlike many anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs), 9,12-capnellene-8,10-diol is advantageous in its selectivity for the COX isoenzyme COX-2, avoiding many of the gastrointestinal side effects associated with the inhibition of COX-1. This fact would allow for the administration of 9,12-capnellene-8,10-diol in higher doses, potentially offering significant relief from neuropathic pain. References

Asola_Bhatti_Wildlife_Sanctuary
Asola-Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary lies at the far southern edge of the city of Delhi near Tughlaqabad in the Delhi National Capital Territory of India. This protected area contains one of the last surviving remnants of Ridge hill range and its semi arid forest habitat and its dependent wildlife, the northernmost extension of the Aravalli mountains that begin in the state of Rajasthan. Once this forested ridge area extended throughout the city of Delhi, but development has all but destroyed it. The reserve is found at the end of a rutted track that leads through a dusty unlicensed village.(Invasion of the killer monkeys, October 24 2007, ASIA-PACIFIC, independent.ie) The Sanctuary is located on Southern Ridge, the northern terminal of Hill Range, one of the oldest mountain system of the world. Biodiversity significance of Ridge lies in its merger with plains. Legal protected Status of southern ridgh was uncertain till 1986 when community lands of the villages of Asola, Shapur & Maidangari (4707 Acre) were notified during 1986 and the lands of Bhatti (2167 Acre) were notified in 1991 as Sanctuary.(ASOLA BHATTI WILD LIFE SANCTUARY, Department of Forest, Delhi Government)LOCATION & APPROACHIt is located in South Delhi Distt. all along Delhi Haryana, Faridabad and Gurgaon interstate border. It an be approach from Tughlaqabad (Mehruali-Badarpur Road) to Surajkund Road (2 Km) near Karni Singh Shooting Range or from Mehrauli via Temple 6 Km near Sanjay Colony (Bhatti Area). It is about 25 Km from Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, the Delhi Railway station is about 30 Km and Maharana Pratap Bus Stand is about 32 Km from the sanctuary.(VALUESBiogeographically it represents outlier of Aravalli Mountain Range among protected area in India. It has a high potential for establishing conservation education & nature interpretation programs. It is a potential green lung & carbon sink for Indias capital. Here there is an opportunity for establishing long term strategies for restoration of habitat & Biological monitoring. There is a potential for improvement in local ground water regime for advantage to the population living in vicinity of Sanctuary. It also provides a potential shelterbelt against advancing aridity.(ATTRACTIONSNature trail 2 Km exposing floral & faunal element, topography of area.Good patches of Anogeissus,Balanite & riparian belt representative of Aravali.Large worked out minepits of Bhatti area in process of reclamation & establishment likely to be developed wetland habitat.Historical place around sanctuary are surajkund(Haryana), Tughlakabad & Adilabad ruins (N.Delhi), Chattarpur Temple.(Eco-restoration of Bhatti area of Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary through Eco Task Force (ETF)The Department of Environment, Delhi Government has been implementing a project on Rehabilitation of 2100 acres of Bhatti Mines area since October 2000, which is a part of Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary. Project period was for 5 years at the cost of Rs.823 lacs, same was extended for a further period of 3 years with an additional outlay of Rs.493.19 lakhs. Up to 31.03.2006, 7.00 lakhs saplings have been already planted. The project was further extended for another 3 years. A second Eco Task Force was created for Asola Wildlife Sanctuary of 5000 acres.(Plantation/Greening of Delhi, Department of Environment, Delhi Government)Illegal miningThere has been a history of illegal mining within the sanctuary and surrounding Delhi Ridge hill area for red badarpur sand and stone which are always in hot demand for building activity and construction. The surrounding area is also known as Bhatti mines. There are large open and deep pits in the ground all over the sanctuary and many are lying abandoned for years and turn into ponds of water in the rainy season.(Illegal mining in sanctuary, Mar 16 2010, Indian Express)Monkey menace: Home to captured stray urban monkeysDelhi city as per some officials has anywhere between 5,000 and 20,000 stray macaque (Macaca mulatta) monkeys, though this could easily be too low. Parts of the city, especially on the southern edge, are besieged with these teeming animals, who sit on the roadside as traffic passes, or else play in the branches of the tree cover above. Dealing with the monkey problem has been a slow process, Hindus believe that the animals are manifestations of the monkey god Hanuman and feed them bananas and peanuts especially near temples. Culling them is out of the question. Delhis attempts to persuade a number of other states to accept the citys monkeys have also fallen flat. The authorities in other states have said they had enough monkeys of their own to be dealing with, never mind taking in extra troublemakers from Delhi. In 2007 the federal government demanded that the city authorities act against the monkeys. Exasperated by the monkeys, which had previously broken into a government office, torn up and destroyed secret documents and even broken into the complex in which Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs office is located, bitten staff and members of public, they called for action. In May 2007, under pressure from various politicians and campaigners, the Delhi High Court ordered the authorities to begin rounding up the stray monkeys and relocating them to a specially constructed sanctuary. That, they believed, would be the end of the problem.(Authorities have established a sanctuary by erecting a 45ft wall of hardened plastic that contains an area of many acres in Asola-Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, Delhi. Since April, officials captured and released 1,650 monkeys into the reserve. Trucks was deliver shipments of caged inmates trapped in the City. The city pays monkey catchers 450 rupees (5.50) per animal and has planned to increase the number it employs. We trap them in cages and transfer them to the reserve, explains an official in the citys wildlife department. However the released monkeys are not well contained inside the reserve walls as they climb over it and attack and pinch people in the neighboring village where they like to go for foraging.((Public Notice: Stop feeding the monkeys in public places in Delhi)See also* Zoological Park Delhi* drain bird sanctuary, Delhi* lake or Najafgarh jheel (Now completely drained by Najafgarh drain)* National Park, bordering Delhi in adjoining District, Haryana* Sanctuary, bordering Delhi in adjoining PradeshReferencesFurther reading* Using microbes to green Asola Bhatti, Nov 3, 2002, Times of IndiaExternal links* ASOLA BHATTI WILD LIFE SANCTUARY, Department of Forest, Delhi Government

Sam_Pa
The mysterious Sam Pa is believed to be the fabulously wealthy (Le Patron de la China International Fund chez le Premier Minister: des beaux jours qui sannoncent pour les secteurs energeique et minier guineens http://www.guinee24.com/index.php?id5&no_cache1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D3619&cHashc5b55b2237aee7c87fd72a10a112609a) head of the 88 Queensway Group and numerous subsidiary companies. He and his group are believed to operate mining and resource concessions in a number of countries notably across Africa. Pa has also been the subject of controversy, allegedly propping up Mugabes ZANU-PF regime in Zimbabwe and securing business contacts on the back of a coup detat in Madagascar and civil unrest in Guinea.HistorySam Pa is alleged to use a number of different aliases; at least eight different names were listed in connection with Pa in an American Congressional report (88 Queensway Group, A Case Study in Chinese Investors Operations in Angola and Beyond. US -China Economic & Security Review Commission. Levkowitz, McLellan Ross & Warner 10 July 2009). Some of the names used are Sam Pa, Sampa, Samo, Sam King, Sa Muxu, Xu Songhua, Xu Jinghua, Ghui Ka Leung.It is unknown why Pa uses so many aliases. Attempts to research Pas history prove inconclusive, which has led some to the belief that he is a princeling - the son of a well connected original Chinese communist reveolutionary (ZANU in shadow of elusive Chinese magnate, The Times (RSA)). Reports also list one of Pas aliases as having a Russian military background (Deborah Brautigam, The Dragons Gift p372) that spent time in Angola during the Civil War (State or Mate? Whos behind China Fund?, John Garnaut). It is believed that during Pas time with the Russian military he first met the future Angolan President Eduardo Dos Santos.( This was a relationship that he exploited after the Civil War to secure a monopoly over reconstruction projects, which in turn allowed Pa to develop his business interests in China buying a host of construction businesses sucj as China Steel 20 (Zhongtie 20), Guangxi Construction and Engineering, Guangxi Water and Electric, Sichuan Nanchong, Sichuan Uingshan, Fuikan Ningde,Jinghend INternational and others (Blog entry 02/10/1007 http://www.chineseinafrica.com). It is also alleged by Chinese bloggers that Pa provided weapons and support during the Civil War (Luping 01/18/2007 http://www.africawindows.com).Current situationSam Pa is said to be the President of the International Fund (CIF) (Le Patron de la China International Fund chez le Premier Minister: des beaux jours qui sannoncent pour les secteurs energeique et minier guineens http://www.guinee24.com/index.php?id5&no_cache1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D3619&cHashc5b55b2237aee7c87fd72a10a112609a) and named by an American Congressional report to be involved in the 88 Queensway Group of businesses.( Some of the businesses associated with the 88 Queensway Group include China Sonangol, Dayuan International (formerly Beiya International) and No 20 China Railways Bureau (Alex Vines, Lillian Wong, Markus Weimer and Indira Campos. Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House): Thirst for African Oil. Asian National Oil Companies in Nigeria and Angola.). However it is unclear exactly how many businesses are involved in the 88 Queensway Group with over 30 companies registered to the same address with operations throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and the United States.Pas involvement is often not listed in any company documents,( but in a common Chinese practice he lists the woman believed to be his wife, Veronica Fung, as director in his place.( Veronica Fung is listed as Director for at least 24 companies, including CIF and China Sonangol.( Alongside Veronica Fund, Pa is also aided by the husband and wife team, Lo Fung Hung and Wang Xiangfei, who also hold directorships on a number of Queensway businesses.( Despite their titles of Director, Lo and Wang have been described as puppets controlled by Pa.(As head of the International Fund, Pa has traveled to a number of countries meeting high ranking officials and Presidents. Some noteworthy inclusions are his connections to Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos,( Zimbabwean President Mugabe,( Venezuelan President Chvez, Argentinean President Fernndez de Kirchner( and Guinean Prime Minister Dore (. It is also believed the Pa and CIF have business connections in Tanzania and Madagascar.( Often Pa begin State level relationhips at a time when a country is experiencing domestic troubles. For example on 28 September 2009, 150 unarmed pro-democracy Guinean protestors were massacred by GUinean government troops - a week later CIF negotiated a US$7 billion deal with the regime. A similar situation occurred in Madagascar following a coup. It is thought that Pa through CIF an its associated companies has committed upwards of US$20 billion in investment funds, mainly in unstable African dictatorships.(One particular political connection Pa tries to keep quiet is that of his connections to the Chinese State. Commentators have stated that Pa and CIFs programmes must have been approved by the Chinese Government.( CIF and Sam Pa are positioned as a key interface in the relationship between the Angolan and Chinese states and the control of Angolan resources - all Angolan oil contracts for the Chinese State company Sinopec are controlled by CIF.(One of Pas puppet directors, Wang Xiangfei, was previously a director of the China Everbright Group and currently is a non-executive director of China International Trust and Investment Company (Group), both state-owned companies in the Peoples Republic of China. Both China Everbright and CITIC are believed to be subordinate corporations of the PRC Ministry of State Securitys Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (COTSIND) (Dr Howard DeVore: Chinas Intelligence and Internal Security Forces). Another Director, Wu Yang, of at least 14 companies with Pa an the 88 Queensway Group has links to the Chinese PRC Ministry of Public Security and Chinese Ministry of State Security.( On company filings, Mr Wu Yang lists his residential address as No.14 Dong Chang An Street, Beijing, China. This address is he headquarters for the Ministry of Public Safety (MPS), a domestic security service of the Chinese Government. Also located in this compound is a reception office for the Ministry of State Security (MSS), the preimary state agency responsible for foreign intelligence activities.(ControversySam Pa has been the subject of damning press and internet blog reporting and his ties to Mugabes ZANU-PF were revealed in the Johannesburg Sunday Times.( It is alleged that in return for diamonds and mineral resources to supply Chinas booming economy, Pa has provided funds and equipment to the secretive Zimbabwe Intelligence Organisation (CIO) to enable it to deliver an electoral victory for Mugabe and his party.( Pa allegedly had been underwriting operations for the Zimbabwean Secret Service to influence the outcomes of polls in favor of ZANU-PF ( and thereby further secure his business dealings in Zimbabwe. In early 2010 Sam Pa offered to  match the salaries of the entire Zimbabwean Secret Service, Police and Army to ensure their support for ZANU-PF.( In return, Pas joint venture with the Zimbabwean Secret Service, Sino-Zim Development, was listed at the top of a classified ZANU-PF list of special national interest projects.(Sam Pa and his business such as CIF, China Sonangol and Sino-Zimbabwe have often been disassociated from by official Chinese representation. Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhao Zing discouraged Argentinean President Kirchner from entering into any agreements with Sam Pa associated business.( The Wikileak Cablegate affair revealed that Chinese Ambassador to Angola Bolum Zhang also distanced himself from CIF stating CIFs weak management and lack of leadership have stalled many... projects (Wikileaks: cablegate, cable 2009-01-27 (ID: 09LUANDA51) NEW CHINA CREDIT LINE UNDER CONSIDERATION, Retrieved 2010-12-19.).CIF and China Sonangol have had damning reports on their ability to plan and complete some of their projects due to difficulty in raising funds.( Pas work in Angola has been heavily criticised for non-completion, with some saying the Pas companies were just playing a game and in the eyes of the Angolan Government have gone through process from belief to feeling cheated (. Sam Pas work on recontrusting the Benguela railway line attracted criticism from Angolan locals who quoted The Chinese spent months getting the camp together and bringing in brand-new bulldozers. Then instead of beginning to repair the line, they dismantled it all, ate their dogs and left.

 prizes            Nikolai Semenovich Kurnakov (; 6 December, 1860  19 March, 1941) was a Russian chemist.BiographyKurnakov was born in Nolinsk, Oblast. He attended a high school at Novgorod and later studied at the mining institute in Petersburg. He published his first paper on alum crystallization and thioantimoniate in 1882.() In the same year he graduated as a mining engineer. During his visit to France, Germany and Austria Kurnakov studied salt manufacturing in several locations. The scientific work of this trip became his Ph.D. thesis, which he completed in 1884. He then worked for several years at the mining institute, mostly on the formation of salts and potash deposits and mining and benefication of salt and potash. In 1893, Kurnakov became professor of chemistry for his work on the reactions of cis- and trans- platinum complexes with thiourea, today known as the test.()() In 1902 he became professor  at the Petersburg Polytechnic Institute, which he established together with Mendeleev and Aleksandrovich Menshutkin. He held the position until 1930. In his later years, he focused his work on platinum chemistry and platinum production. He received several prizes, for example the Prize in 1936, the of the Red Banner of Labour in 1939 and the Prize in 1941. He was also awarded a Doctor honoris causa by of Moscow in 1909. After the death of his wife in 1940 his health deteriorated and he died in a sanatorium in Barvikha on 19 March 1941.(()A mineral was named kurnakovite in his honor.()()ReferencesFurther reading* * * * * * *  . .     // . 1924. .4, . 6. .339356 (Continuity of the chemical transformations of matter)*  . .

Antlerpeton
type)Antlerpeton is an extinct genus of early tetrapod from the Carboniferous of Nevada.() It is known from a single poorly preserved skeleton from the Peak Formation of Eureka County. A mix of features in its compound vertebrae suggest that Antlerpeton is a primitive tetrapod that has affinities with later, more advanced forms. Its robust pelvis and hind limbs allowed for effective locomotion on land, but the animal was likely still tied to a semiaquatic lifestyle near the coast.Description and historyThe holotype skeleton of Antlerpeton, ANS VP 19909, is the only known specimen of the genus. It was found in a block of mudstone in the form of fragmentary bones and natural molds. A latex impression was made to study ANS VP 19909 in greater detail. No other plant or animal fossils were found in the surrounding area. Antlerpeton was first described by Keith Stewart Thomson, Shubin, and Forrest Poole in 1998. It was named after the Antler highlands, a group of mountains in Nevada and Utah that formed during the Devonian and Early Carboniferous. The species A. clarkii was named for Charles G. Clark, a geologist of the Western Mining Corporation (an Irish mining company based in Nevada) who discovered the holotype in 1990.(The holotype of Antlerpeton consists of vertebrae, ribs, a girdle, two broken femora, and gastralia. All of the bones are articulated. With up to 28 vertebrae, the presacral vertebral column (the part of the column in front of the pelvic girdle) is long. Each vertebral segment is composed of a large principal centrum and a pair of two small bones that fit in front of it. The spinal cord passes through the larger bones, while the smaller bones are positioned to either side of the midline. Pubo-ischiadic  plates, primitive forms of the pubis and ischium of later tetrapods, are present, but it is unclear whether they were fused into a strong pelvic girdle. A small projection of bone is present on the acetabulum, a depression in the pelvis that attaches with the end of the femur. This projection is also seen in the Late Devonian tetrapod Ichthyostega. The femur of Antlerpeton is much more robust than that of Ichthyostega, and has prominent ridges like the trochanter that are attachment points for well-developed leg muscles. Antlerpeton also has small scales covering its underside.(ClassificationBecause the only specimen of Antlerpeton is incomplete and lacks a skull, its relationships with other early tetrapods are poorly understood. The compound vertebrae of Antlerpeton distinguish it from lepospondyls and ally it with more primitive stem tetrapods. Antlerpeton shows characteristics of both early rhachitomous tetrapods and later schizomerous tetrapods. Rhachitomous tetrapods have two types of bones in each vertebral segment: the pleurocentrum and the intercentrum. The intercentrum is the larger of the two bones in rhachitomes, while the pleurocentra are present as two smaller bones in a dorsal position between the intercentra. Schizomerous tetrapods differ from rhachitomes in that their pleurocentra have descended to a more ventral position in the vertebral column. The pleurocentra enlarged in reptiliomorphs to become the main element of the vertebral centrum. While the compound vertebrae of Antlerpeton are similar to those of classic rhachitomes, the pleurocentra form a distinctive connection with the intercentra in front of and behind them. This pattern is called the anteropleural condition because the paired pleurocentra are associated with the anterior face of the intercentrum behind them. The anteropleural condition is seen in other forms like Whatcheeria, which are generally considered to be advanced rhachitomes. However, it is also seen in fish like Lohsania, suggesting that the  feature is not unique to derived early tetrapods.(PaleobiologyAntlerpeton had several adaptations for a terrestrial lifestyle. While early tetrapods like Ichthyostega and Acanthostega were mostly aquatic, Antlerpeton could probably move effectively on land with its robust legs and pelvic girdle. The femur is large, and many bony ridges provide anchorage for muscles that would have been useful for both swimming and moving on land. The thickened pubis and acetabulum of the pelvic girdle and the large sacral vertebrae that connect it with the vertebral column allowed Antlerpeton to withstand the stresses of terrestrial locomotion. The holotype specimen of Antlerpeton was found in rocks that were deposited in coastal and marine settings. Therefore, it is likely that Antlerpeton inhabited rivers or marshes near the coast and had some tolerance of salt water.(References

Open_science_data
Open science data is a type of data focussed on publishing observations and results of scientific activities available for anyone to analyze and reuse.  While the idea of open science data has been actively promoted since the 1950s, the rise of the Internet has significantly lowered the cost and time required to publish or obtain data.HistoryThe concept of open access to scientific data was institutionally established with the formation of the Data Center system, in preparation for the Geophysical Year of 1957-1958.()  The International Council of Scientific Unions (now the Council for Science) established several World Data Centers to minimize the risk of data loss and to maximize data accessibility, further recommending in 1955 that data be made available in machine-readable form.()In 1995 GCDIS (US) put its position clearly in On the Full and Open Exchange of Scientific Data (A publication of the Committee on Geophysical and Environmental Data - National Research Council):The Earths atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere form an integrated system that transcends national boundaries. To understand the elements of the system, the way they interact, and how they have changed with time, it is necessary to collect and analyze environmental data from all parts of the world. Studies of the global environment require international collaboration for many reasons:*to address global issues, it is essential to have global data sets and products derived from these data sets;*it is more efficient and cost-effective for each nation to share its data and information than to collect everything it needs independently; and*the implementation of effective policies addressing issues of the global environment requires the involvement from the outset of nearly all nations of the world.International programs for global change research and environmental monitoring crucially depend on the principle of full and open data exchange (i.e., data and information are made available without restriction, on a non-discriminatory basis, for no more than the cost of reproduction and distribution. (On the Full and Open Exchange of Scientific Data (1995) National Research Council, Washington, DC)The last phrase highlights the traditional cost of disseminating information by print and post. It is the removal of this cost through the Internet which has made data vastly easier to disseminate technically. It is correspondingly cheaper to create, sell and control many data resources and this has led to the current concerns over non-open data.More recent uses of the term include:* SAFARI 2000 (South Africa, 2001) used a license informed by ICSU and NASA policies (http://mercury.ornl.gov/safari2k/s2kpolicy.pdf)* the human genome (Jim Kent 2002) (Kent, 2002)* An Open Data Consortium on geospatial data (Open Data Consortium ca. 2003) (2003)* Manifesto for Open Chemistry (Peter Murray-Rust, Henry Rzepa 2004) (Murray-Rust and Rzepa, 2004) (2004)* Presentations to JISC and  OAI under the title open data (Open Data at CERN Workshop on Innovations in Scholarly Communication (OAI4) Peter Murray-Rust, 2005) (Murray-Rust, 2005)* Science Commons launch (Report on Science Commons Dec 2004) (2004)* First Open Knowledge Forums (London, UK) run by the Knowledge Foundation (London UK) on open data in relation to civic information and geodata (http://www.okfn.org/okforums/) (February and April 2005)* The Obelisk group in chemistry (mantra: Open Data, Open Source, Open Standards) (2005) * The Petition for Open Data in Crystallography is launched by the Crystallography Open Database Advisory Board.(http://www.crystallography.net/)(2005)* XML Conference & Exposition 2005 (Semantic Web Data Integration with hCalendar and GRDDL; Dan Connolly  | From Syntax to Semantics (XML 2005) Atlanta, GA, USA) (Connolly 2005)* SPARC Open Data mailing list (SPARC Open Data Mailing list) (2005)* First draft of the Open Knowledge Definition explicitly references Open Data (http://www.opendefinition.org/) (2005)* XTech (XTech 2005) (Dumbill, 2005),(Tim Bray and Tim OReilly) (Bray and OReilly 2006)In 2004, the Science Ministers of all nations of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), which includes most developed countries of the world, signed a declaration which essentially states that all publicly-funded archive data should be made publicly available.(OECD Declaration on Open Access to publicly-funded data) Following a request and an intense discussion with data-producing institutions in member states, the OECD published in 2007 the OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding as a soft-law recommendation.(OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding)In 2005 Edd Dumbill introduced an Open Data theme in XTech, including:* government.* Public web services.* Grassroots data.* Scientific and academic publishing.* property.* Blogging and personal content.* Web.In 2006 Science Commons (Science Commons in Washington 2006) ran a 2-day conference in Washington where the primary topic could be described as Open Data. It was reported that the amount of micro-protection of data (e.g. by license) in areas such as biotechnology was creating a of the anticommons. In this the costs of obtaining licenses from a large number of owners made it uneconomic to do research in the area.In 2007 SPARC and Science Commons announced a consolidation and enhancement of their author addenda (SPARC-OAF forum)In 2010 the Panton Principles launched,(Launch of the Panton Principles for Open Data in Science and Is It Open Data? Web Service) advocating  Open Data in science and setting out for principles to which providers must comply to have their data Open.Relation to open accessMuch data is made available through scholarly publication, which now attracts intense debate under Open Access. The Open Access Initiative (2001) coined this term:By open access to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.The logic of the declaration permits re-use of the data although the term literature has connotations of human-readable text and can imply a scholarly publication process. In Open Access discourse the term full-text is often used which does not emphasize the data contained within or accompanying the publication.Some Open Access publishers do not require the authors to assign copyright and the data associated with these publications can normally be regarded as Open Data. Some publishers have Open Access strategies where the publisher requires assignment of the copyright and where it is unclear that the data in publications can be truly regarded as Open Data.The ALPSP and STM publishers have issued a statement about the desirability of making data freely available (http://www.alpsp.org/ForceDownload.asp?id129):Publishers recognise that in many disciplines data itself, in various forms, is now a key output of research. Data searching and mining tools permit increasingly sophisticated use of raw data. Of course, journal articles provide one view of the significance and interpretation of that data  and conference presentations and informal exchanges may provide other views  but data itself is an increasingly important community resource. Science is best advanced by allowing as many scientists as possible to have access to as much prior data as possible; this avoids costly repetition of work, and allows creative new integration and reworking of existing data.andWe believe that, as a general principle, data sets, the raw data outputs of research, and sets or sub-sets of that data which are submitted with a paper to a journal, should wherever possible be made freely accessible to other scholars. We believe that the best practice for scholarly journal publishers is to separate supporting data from the article itself, and not to require any transfer of or ownership in such data or data sets as a condition of publication of the article in question.Even though this statement was without any effect on the open availability of primary data related to publications in journals of the ALPSP and STM members. Data tables provided by the authors as supplement with a paper are still available to subscribers only.See also* data* CODATA* Commons* OpenWetWare* Open ConnectomeProjectExternal links* Research Data Canada* Open Data In Science article (P Murray-Rust)ReferencesobertesDataabiertosdataapertidata

Santa_Ana_mine_(Peru)
The Santa Ana Silver Project is a proposed open pit mining project by the Creek Mining Corporation for the Santa Ana silver deposit in District, Province, Region in southern Peru. Bear Creeks concession to the mine was revoked in late June 2011.() The company states that 63.2 million ounces of silver (proven and probable mineral reserves) are at the site, 19.7% of the companys total silver reserves.() Of these, 16.6 million ounces are proven, and 46.6 million ounces are probable. Bear Creek proposes to operate the mine for an 11-year period during which it would extract approximately 47.4 million ounces of silver.() A possible extension of the mining period could bring an additional 35 million ounces, according to company estimates.( Mineral reserves constitute 37 million tons of silver-containing rock; within them, the silver occurs at a average density of 53g of silver per ton of rock.( Cyanide, a toxin, would be used to separate the silver from the rock.()Prior to regional protests against mining, construction was scheduled for late 2011 with operations to start in 2012.( However, amidst protests in May 2011, the company withdrew its staff until at least after the June 5, 2011, election. The Peruvian government agreed to create a commission representing multiple government agencies concerning mining in Yunguyo and Chucuito provinces. On May 24, Bear Creek announced that this measure would delay construction until 2012 and operations until 2013.(Bear Creek Mining Corporation, BEAR CREEK REPORTS ON PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT STUDY ON MINING PERMIT PROCESSES WITHIN TWO SOUTHERN PUNO PROVINCES, press release, May 24, 2011.) On May 28, 2011, Peruvian government negotiators agreed to delay approval of the mines environmental license for twelve months.() Protests resumed on June 8 and spreading across to Puno region to cover a variety of issues. Government egotiations with protesters resulted in five government decrees affecting the region, issued on June 25, including Supreme Decree 032-2011-EM which cancels Bear Creeks concession at Santa Ana(On Friday, hours before the deadly clash at the airport, Garcias cabinet revoked the license of Canadian mining firm Bear Creek in a bid to persuade locals residents to end protests that have dragged on for more than a month. ) and bans mining activities in the Huacullani and Kelluyo Districts of Chucuito Province.()Proposed operationsBear Creek Mining contracted Ausenco Vector, Independent Mining Consultants, Inc. (IMC), and Resource Development, Inc. to conduct a feasibility study on mining operations for the project. Their proposed operations were summarized in a technical report issued on October 21, 2010. IMC proposed a conventional open pit mining plan based on extracting rock using 63-ton-capacity loading trucks. Prior to production, at least 2.97 million tons of rock would be removed. Each year, about 3.6 million tons of rock would be extracted for 9.5 years; an additional 1.7 years would be required to finish processing it.() During the extraction process, 1.96 tons of rock will be removed from every ton of ore extracted.( The ore will then be crushed to a size of 3/4 inch and sent to a heap leach, where a sodium cyanide solution would be used to extract a silver-zinc precipitate from the rock; this will be smelted on site into mostly silver Dore bars; lead and most zinc will remain unextracted.( Mining operations would be contracted to a local company.() The feasibility study proposes to supply the water used by the mine from water wells in a very large alluvial aquifer connected by a 12-km pipeline and from a river 10 km north of the project.()ProtestsThe project has been a focus of regional protests in 2011 against proposed mining, led by the Natural Resources Defense Front of the Southern Zone of Puno () and the National Confederation of Peruvian Communities Affeted by Mining (; Conami). Protesters concerns center on the threat of contamination to surrounding waterways, including Titicaca, to the detriment of fishing and farming.(() The Defense Front called a two-day strike in late April 2010, during which a sixty-year-old woman, Mara Choque Limachi, was fatally wounded by the impact of a tear gas canister shot by police attempting to clear a blockaded bridge.() A larger mobilization, called by both organizations began in early May, and continues .( See also * in Peru References  External links * Santa Ana mine page at Bear Creek Mining corporate website* Feasibility Study: Santa Ana Project, Puno, Per; NI 43-101 Technical Report, prepared by Ausenco Vector for Bear Creek Mining Corporation.

Eppawala
footnotes                Eppawala is a settlement and Niladhari administrative division in North Central Province, Lanka. It forms part of the Divisional Secretariat within the District. It is situated around  south of the ancient city of Anuradhapura and  north east of Sri Lankan capital Colombo.Eppawala and its surroundings are located within a geological region of high-grade phosphate deposits - Sri Lankas only phosphate deposits. Mined since the 1970s by government-owened Phosphate, the deposits attracted media attention and spawned national protests in the late 1990s when overseas corporations expressed interest in initiating intensive mining operations. Name Although the name Eppawala refers to the settlement itself, in the context of the surrounding geology it may also refer to the network of villages located within the proposed phosphate exploration zones and for which Eppawala is the urban centre. In 1999, approximately 40,000 people lived inside this zone.(http://people.whitman.edu/~walterjs/tomen2.html) Population Humans have resided in Eppawala for over 2000 years.(http://lightworks.8m.com/eppawela.htm) It received a population boost during the 1990s when displaced people (IDPs) settled there as a cause of the Lankan Civil War,(http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/4D02FDCD8C1ADB57C12573CA00336885-Full_Report.pdf) due in part to Eppawalas location on the fringes of regional population hub Anuradhapura. Geography Eppawala is situated within the centre of the ancient region of Rajarata. Past civilizations who had populated the region had developed sustainable methods of conserving and irrigating excess monsoon rainfall, methods still in use by the current population (http://multiworldindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/eppawela.pdf) and based around a  long canal named the Jayaganga. Phosphate deposits Around  of phosphates have been determined to exist within an area of  around Eppawala.(http://www.newsfirst.lk/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id14205:enough-phosphate-in-eppawala-for-another-millennium&catid97:news-items-2&Itemid294) The deposits were discovered in 1971 when a government geological survey found igneous carbonate apatite.(http://www.elaw.org/node/1295) Responsibility for the deposits was assigned in 1974 to a government Divisional Development Council and subsequently to Phosphate, the present day controllers.Lanka Phosphate mined unintensively from 1977, yielding  of rock annually.(http://www.newsfirst.lk/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id14205:enough-phosphate-in-eppawala-for-another-millennium&catid97:news-items-2&Itemid294) However in 1987 an American corporation named Freeport-McMoRan began discreet negotiations for mining rights to the region. The bidding gained public attention after the Sri Lankan government advertised for joint venture proposals in 1992, and negotiation with Arigo (an association between the Group and Freeport-McMoRan) and Corporation began.(http://people.whitman.edu/~walterjs/mcmoran.html) They were bidding for control of a  exploration zone(http://www.island.lk/2005/03/13/features3.html) with intentions to mine  over 30 years.(http://www.island.lk/2000/12/01/featur03.html) Public response There was a widespread perception that these plans, if they came to fruition, would have an overwhelmingly negative impact upon the regional environment and destroy the functioning of the Jayaganga irrigation system. Furthermore, Freeport-McMoRans conduct in past endeavors  such as at its mine in Indonesia  had drawn much criticism. A change in government in 1994 delayed proceedings briefly, but the new government were found to be similarly eager to sell the deposits and dinal drafts of the plans were completed on 4, 1997 and granted IMC Agrico exclusive mining rights within the exploration zone. Numerous demonstrations were held nationally over the next few years, including a protest involving 7000 people on 30, 2000 in Colombo fronted by the Committee for the Protection of the Eppawela Phosphate mines.(http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/BD01Df01.html) In 1999 a court case Bulankulama v Ministry of Industrial Development (884/99) was tabled by seven individuals requesting protection for Eppawala and claiming breach of their fundamental rights as set out in the of Sri Lanka. This was upheld in the Court of Sri Lanka on 2, 2000.(http://www.lawnet.lk/docs/case_law/slr/HTML/2000SLR3V243.htm) Bidding on the deposits was halted and further study of the region was ordered.

History_of_rail_transport_in_Liberia
:This article is part of the of rail transport by country seriesFile:Railways in liberia-de.svg|thumb|300px|map depicting Liberias railways.The history of rail transport in Liberia began shortly after War II, when the of Monrovia was completed, with limited rail access.  It had been developed by American military forces.In the early 1960s, three long distance railway lines were constructed in Liberia, mainly for the transport of ore from mines to port facilities.  Of about  in total length, they were the River Railway, the Railway, and the Mine Railway, respectively.( )All three of these lines were later closed down, due to the effects of the two Civil Wars (19891996 and 19992003).  As of August 2010, only the Bong Mine Railway had been restored to operational condition.() Beginnings As early as the 1920s, the establishment of railways was envisaged as part of the economic development of Liberias mineral resources.  These railways would have been constructed by the British Liberian Development Company. The bankruptcy of Liberia and the intervention of the U.S. firm Tire & Rubber Company foiled these plans.During World War II, the USA began preparations for the exploitation of the iron ore deposits in Liberia.  The main element of this investment process was the Freeport of Monrovia, which was opened in 1948 as the first deep sea port in the country with a rail connection.Mano River RailwayLiberias first long distance railway, the  long Mano River Railway, was built in 1960.()() It connected the western mining areas on the River with Monrovia, via the city of Tubmanburg. This railway was  gauge.Lamco RailwayThe majority of Liberias mines are located in its northern border area.  Further south, a second iron ore loading port was set up in 1963, on the coast near Buchanan.  The associated  long Railway was simultaneously put into operation, to link the Lamco mine at Yekepa, near the Guinean border, with the new port.(() The Lamco Railway was built as a single track  gauge line, and had eight intermediate stations with passing loops.  It was one of the first iron ore railways to be designed specifically for use by long trains, and to be fitted with modern aids to operation, including centrally controlled signalling.  Trains on the Lamco Railway were normally made up of three  locomotives hauling ninety ore cars.  When loaded, they carried a total of  of ore.  As at 1980, the maximum tonnage of ore carried was  per annum, and the rolling stock fleet comprised 14 locomotives and 510 ore cars.()During the civil wars, the railway was damaged and fell into disuse.  However, it has recently been rebuilt by Mittal.(Bong Mine RailwayIn the 1960s, a German private investment group acquired a mining concession in the Range(Range) area and founded the DELIMCO mining company.  To transport the Bong Range iron ore to Monrovia for export, another railway line, which became known as the Bong Mining Railway, was constructed in 1964. It is also standard gauge, and is  long.(Effects of the civil warsDuring the civil wars, parts of Liberias rail network were cut off, and train operations had to be shut down due to lack of profitability. Meanwhile, Chinese construction crews worked on a renovation of the facilities, as China was interested in further developing Liberias mineral resources. The Bridge,(:de:Tubmanbrcke) at  in length the most important railway bridge in the country, was being reconstructed in 2011.()  It forms part of the Mano River Railway.See also*of Liberia*transport in LiberiaReferencesNotesJournals*  (Digitized full text, about the Bong Mining Railway) External links*Birkenhead to Liberia  Part A  Part B - reminiscences of a former Lamco Railway train driver (with images)*EMD export  Liberia - images of Liberian locomotivesin Liberia#Geschichte

Northern_Krai
Northern Krai (, Severny Krai) was a krai (a first-level administrative and municipal unit) of the Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1929 to 1936.() Its seat was in the city of Arkhangelsk. The Krai was located in the North of European Russia, and its territory is currently divided between Arkhangelsk, Vologda, Kostroma, and Kirov Oblasts, the Autonomous Okrug, and the Republic. History The krai was established on January 14, 1929 by the Central Executive Committee. The territory of the krai was formed from three governorates (Arkhangelsk, Vologda, and Northern Dvina) and the Autonomous Oblast.()On July 15, 1929 the All-Russian Central Executive Committee issued a decree splitting the Northern Krai (with the exception of the Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast, which remain as a single unit with the seat in Ust-Sysolsk, and the islands of Vaygach, Kolguev, Matveev, Zemlya, Islands, and Josef Land) into five administrative districts (okrugs)()* Okrug (with the seat located in Arkhangelsk;* Okrug (with the borders and the seat to be defined);* Dvina Okrug (Ustyug);* Okrug (Nyandoma);* Okrug (Vologda).Before the Krai was established, the division of its constituent governorates mixed the old division inherited from the Russian Empire (uyezds) with the new one (districts, or raions). The same decree established the division of the Krai into districts. All okrugs and the Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast were divided into districts, and the Arctic ocean islands remained subordinate to the Krai executive committee.The following districts have been established,(* In the Arkhangelsky Okrug: Arkhangelsky (with the administrative center in Arkhangelsk), Bereznikovsky (Bereznik), Chekuyevsky (Chekuyevo), Karpogorsky (Karpogory), Kholmogorsky (Kholmogory), Leshukonsky (Leshukonskoye), Mezensky (Mezen), Onezhsky (Onega), Pinezhsky (Pinega), Plesetsky (the settlement at the Plesetskaya railway station), Primorsky (Arkhangelsk), and Yemetsky (Yemetsk).* In the Nenetsky Okrug: Kanino-Timansky (Pesha), Nenetsky (Khoseda-Khord).* In the Northern Dvina Okrug: Cherevkovsky (Cherevkovo), Kichmengsko-Gorodetsky (Gorodok), Kotlassky (Kotlas), Krasnoborsky (Krasnoborsk), Lalsky (Lalsk), Lensky (Yarensk), Nikolsky (Nikolsk), Oparinsky (settlement at the Oparino railway station), Podosinovsky (Podosinovets), Roslyatinsky (Roslyatino), Sukhonsky (Gorodishchenskoye), Velikoustyugsky (Ustyug), Verkhnetoyemsky (Toyma), Vilegodsky (Ilyinsko-Podomskoye), Vokhomsky (Vokhma).* In the Nyandoma Okrug: Kargopolsky (Kargopol), Konoshsky (settlement at the Konosha railway station), Nyandomsky (Nyandoma), Priozyorny (Konyovo), Rovdinsky (Rovdino), Shenkursky (Shenkursk), Ustyansky (Shangaly), Velsky (Velsk), Verkhovazhsky (Verkhovazhye).* In the Vologda Okrug: Chyobsarsky (settlement at the Chyobsary railway station), Gryazovetsky (Gryazovets), Kharovsky (settlement at the Kharovskaya railway station), Kokshengsky (Gorodok), Kubeno-Ozyorsky (Kubenskoye), Ledengsky (Ledengskoye), Shuysky (Svyatogorye), Sverdlovsky (Sokol), Syamzhensky (Yarygino), Tolshmensky (Ust-Tolshma), Totemsky (Totma), Ust-Kubensky (Ustye), Vologodsky (Vologda), Vozhegodsky (settlement at the Vozhega railway station).* In the Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast: Izhmo-Pechorsky (Izhma), Priluzsky (Obyachevo), Storozhevsky (Storozhevsk), Sysolsky (Vizinga), Udorsky (Koslanskoe), Ust-Kulomsky (Ust-Kulom), Ust-Sysolsky (Ust-Sysolsk), Ust-Tsylemsky (Ust-Tsylma), Ust-Vymsky (Ustvymskoye).In July 1930, the Okrugs have been abolished. The Nenets Okrug became the autonomous unit, the Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast remained intact, and the districts which were part of the four other Okrugs became directly subordinate to the Krai goventment. By August 25, 1930 the Krai consisted of(* Cities of Arkhangelsk and Vologda;* Nenets National District (consisting of Bolshezemelsky, Kanino-Timansky, and Pustozersky districts);* Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast (Izhemsky, Priluzsky, Storozhevsky, Syktyvkarsky, Sysolsky, Troitsko-Pechorsky, Udorsky, Ust-Kulomsky, Ust-Usinsky, Ust-Tsylemsky, and Ust-Vymsky districts);* Fifty districts of central subordination: Bereznikovsky, Chekuyevsky, Cherevkovsky, Chyobsarsky, Gryazovetsky, Kargopolsky, Karpogorsky, Kharovsky, Kholmogorsky, Kichmengsko-Gorodetsky, Kokshengsky, Konoshsky, Kotlassky, Krasnoborsky, Kubeno-Ozersky, Lalsky, Ledengsky, Lensky, Leshukonsky, Mezensky, Nikolsky, Nyuksensky, Nyandomsky, Onezhsky, Oparinsky, Pinezhsky, Plesetsky, Podosinovsky, Primorsky, Priozyorny, Rovdinsky, Roslyatinsky, Shenkursky, Shuysky, Sukhonsky, Sverdlovsky, Syamzhensky, Tolshmensky, Totemsky, Ust-Kubinsky, Ustyansky, Velikoustyuzhsky, Velsky, Verkhnetoyemsky, Verkhovazhsky, Vilegodsky, Vologodsky, Vokhomsky, Vozhegodsky, Yemetsky;* Islands in the Arctic Ocean and Solovetsky Islands.Between 1930 and 1935 there were constant changes in the district configuration, some districts were abolished, established, and renamed. On February 10, 1934, Novaya Zemlya, Vaygach, and a number of smaller islands in the Barents and Kara Seas were moved to the Nenets National Okrug. By 1936, the Krai included 65 districts.( On March 5, 1936, Okrug which was a part of the Northern Krai was established. The Okrug included three districts, Izhemsky, Ust-Tsilemsky, and Ust-Usinsky, and a part of Troitsko-Pechorsky District. This was related due to the beginning of the mining in the North of what is now the Republic.According to the Soviet Constitution, the Northern Krai was abolished, and its territory was divided between newly established Northern Oblast and Republic. The Northern Oblast included 54 districts and was in 1937 split into Arkhangelsk and Vologda Oblasts. Three of the districts of the Northern Krai, Lalsky, Oparinsky, and Podosinovsky, as the result of some later administrative changes, ended up in Oblast. Pavinsky and Vokhomsky District were merged into Oblast.References External links * zh:

Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea
Territorial disputes in the South China Sea involve six states within the region, namely the:*  Republic of China*  of China (Taiwan)*  Philippines*  Vietnam*  Malaysia*  BruneiThe Spratly and Paracel archipelago are two groups of uninhabited islands located within the China Sea, which are subject to a complex territorial dispute involving the surrounding countries. The interests of different nations include acquiring fishing areas around the two archipelagos, the exploitation of oil and gas beneath the Spratly Islands, and the strategic control of a core position.Along with territorial land claims on the islets, the disputes also involve the territorial waters of the various countries within the region. The line drawn by China which marks its claim covers around three-fourths of the total area of the South China Sea.BackgroundThe area is potentially rich in oil deposits. The Ministry of Geological Resources and Mining of the Peoples Republic of China estimated that the South China Sea may contain 17.7 billion tons of crude (compared to Kuwait with 13 billion tons). In the years following the announcement by the ministry, the claims regarding the South China Sea islands intensified.(CHINAS MULTILATERALISM AND THE SOUTH CHINA SEA CONFLICT: QUEST FOR HEGEMONIC STABILITY?) However, other sources claim that the proven reserve of oil in the South China Sea may only be 7.5 billion barrels, or about 1.1 billion tons.(South China Sea Oil and Natural Gas) The South China Sea is dubbed by China as the second Persian Sea. The state-owned China Offshore Exploration Corp. planned to spend 200 billion RMB (US$30 billion) in the next 20 years to exploit oil in the region, with the estimated production of 25 million metric tons of crude oil and natural gas per annum, at a depth of 2000 meters within the next 5 years.(Oil bonanza in South China Sea)On March 11, 1976, the first Philippine oil company discovered an oil field off Palawan Island (island within the South China Sea belonging to the Philippines). These oil fields supply 15% of annual oil consumption in the Philippines.However, none of the countries claiming the Spratly Islands have granted concession offshore to avoid provoking a crisis. In addition, since the territorial dispute is not yet resolved, international oil companies have not made commitments.The abundant fishing opportunities within the region are another motivation for the claim. In 1988, the South China Sea is believed to have accounted for 8% of world fishing catches, a figure that has grown since then. There have been many clashes in the Philippines with foreign fishing vessels (including China) in the Philippine Economic Zone. China believes that the value in fishing and oil from the sea has risen to a trillion dollars.The area is also one of the busiest shipping routes in the world. In the 1980s, at least 270 merchant ships used the route each day. Currently, more than half the tonnage of oil transported by sea passes through it, a figure rising steadily with the growth of Chinese consumption of oil. This traffic is three times greater than that passing through the Canal and five times more than the Canal.2011 agreementOn 20 July 2011, the PRC, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, the ROC and Vietnam agreed to a set of preliminary guidelines which would help resolve the dispute.() The agreement was described by the PRCs assistant foreign minister, Liu Zhenmin, as an important milestone document for cooperation among China and ASEAN countries.( Some of the early drafts acknowledged aspects such as marine environmental protection, scientific research, safety of navigation and communication, search and rescue and combating transnational crime, although the issue of oil and natural gas drilling remains unresolved.See also*of the Paracel Islands*Yellow Sea conflictReferencesExternal Links* Clive Schofield et al., From Disputed Waters to Seas of Opportunity: Overcoming Barriers to Maritime Cooperation in East and Southeast Asia (July 2011)* Rising Tensions in the South China Sea, June 2011 Q&A with Ian J.

Iowa_and_St._Louis_Railway
The Iowa and St. Louis Railway was a project envisioned by several Route employees in 1900 to take advantage of the development of coal mining investments in northern Missouri and southern Iowa. The Iowa and St. Louis project had humble beginnings, resulting in the construction of a branch line of railroad southward in Iowa from a point on the Rock Island called Summit (near present-day Centerville, Iowa) southward into Missouri toward locations such as Connelsville and Novinger. There, the Iowa and St. Louis Construction crews came into conflict with managers of the east to west line running through Novinger, then (1900) known as the Omaha, Kansas City & Eastern Railway ( an affiliate of the City, Pittsburgh & Gulf Railroad). Eventually, the Omaha, Kansas City & Eastern investors took note of the business potential of the Iowa & St. Louis and began to purchase financial interests in the company, taking control in 1901. The Gates-Keefe-Lambert Syndicate of St. Louis and Chicago were controlling interests in the Iowa & St. Louis (19011903). Thereafter, the railroad was sold to the Burlington System (1903) shortly after the Omahha-Kansas City line was declared bankrupt. The Iowa and St. Louis was eventually brought into the Burlington system in 1903, and was operated as an off-branch of the Quincy, Omaha & Kansas City railroad Co. The line was eventually extended south of Novinger into more coal fields in Adair County, Mo. The line construction stopped at Mercyville, Mo., a few thousand feet short of intersecting the Sante Fe Mainline through northern Missouri. The line was built predominantly of 66 lbs. rail or lighter, and was operated by small steam engines. Freight on the line was always mostly coal, coming from underground mines at Connelsville, Mendota, Yarrow, and Youngstown in Missouri, and in the Coal City and Exline area in southern Iowa. Other business included a cucumber pickling plant at Worthington, Missouri, and farm shipments from Livonia, Worthington, and from the Elmer, Mo. area. Passenger service was also available on the line into the 1930s. One off-branch from the line existed, called the Adair County Railroad, the local name for this line was the Spur Up Billys Creek. The decline of the Iowa and St. Louis Railway was rapid. As public subsidies for highways and busses/trucks became substantial in the 1920s, the freight and passenger business were quickly drained away from the Iowa & St. Louis. Coal mines became difficult to operate in the area due to mine flooding and the costs of pumping excessive water, and due to thin seams of coal. Higher labor costs were a product of mine unionization activity, but in fairness to the miners, the jobs were dirty, hazardous and under-paid when one considers the lengthy hours worked and the accident rates. The line was abandoned in part in 1936 from Novinger north to Sedan, Iowa, and the remainder of the line was abandoned south of Novinger in actions before the Commerce Commission in 1942 and in 1950.(See: Johns, Michael R. with Ralph L.

Society_of_Colorado_Pioneers
The Society of Colorado Pioneers was formed in 1872 to recognize and support the first Anglo American settlers in Colorado.  The organization originally only for men, spun off a womans auxiliary group and later a sons group.  In 1943 the Society of Colorado Pioneers was consolidated into the womans group and became the Pioneer Men and Women of Colorado.MembershipThe Society of Colorado Pioneers was established to recognize pioneers who came to Colorado before 1861:  Men could become full, dues-paying members.  Women, who were exempt from dues, could become honorary members.(Society of Colorado Pioneers, Denver Public Library.)Those who settled by 1858 were truly pioneers: The early pioneer came to a silent wilderness.  He took hold of the territory in the raw. He had nothing by his hands, his energy and his courage to start a new civilization in the wilderness.  In 1859 and 1860 people began arriving in the thousands to settle in the mountains, mining camps or valleys.  After 1860 trails were blazed and evidence of civilization had emerged, like newspapers, schools, churches, businesses and other forms of society.(Hill, 157-158.)HistorySociety of Colorado Pioneers:The Society of Colorado Pioneers was founded by men to recognize and assist pioneers who arrived prior to 1861, when the area was part of the Kansas territory.  The Society was formed on January 16, 1872 and incorporated on July 14, 1884.  The first president was Hiram P. Bennett and the first elected chairman was Anselm H. Barker.  From 1894 to June 1939 the Society was located at Curtis and 15th in the Charles Block building  and then at Glenarm and 17th streets the Johnson Building.( Pioneer Women:In September 1889 the Womans auxiliary was organized with 14 members, partly to help meet the Societys goal of assisting pioneers in need.  It grew to 150 members in 1894, when it was incorporated.  In 1934 it was reincorporated as the Pioneer Women of Colorado.((Hill, 159.) Society of Sons of Colorado:Sons of pioneers could become members starting in 1906, but were not eligible to any office in this Society, as long as there is a sufficient member in the present society to fill the respective places.  There were some exceptions, depending on the responsibility but the limitations resulted in Society of Sons of Colorado establishment in 1906.(  Society of Sons of Colorado published a monthly magazine called The Trail: A Magazine for Colorado starting June 1908.(Bishop, 24.)  Restrictions for sons of pioneers were removed within the Society of Colorado by 1921.( Consolidation to The Pioneer Men and Women of Colorado:In February 1943 the Society had decided to consolidate with the Pioneer Women of Colorado and renamed the organization The Pioneer Men and Women of Colorado; The last meeting of the Society of Colorado Pioneers was held on March 27, 1943.( Notes  References * * *

Joshua_Thomas_Noble_Anderson
Joshua Thomas Noble (Noble) Anderson (J T N Anderson) (18651949) was an engineer practising in Melbourne, Australia, and New Zealand during the difficult times in the Depressions of the 1890s and 1930s, but still practised innovative engineering in these periods.Early career and migration to AustraliaAnderson, known commonly by his middle name Noble, was born in Ireland in 1865, and graduated in engineering and arts. Following short engineering engagements in Ireland, he came to Victoria in 1889, undertaking his first engineering in Victoria in connection with the Weir. He then took up a lectureship in mechanical engineering at the of Melbourne, where he met Monash.Monash & AndersonIn 1894 Monash and Anderson set up a consulting partnership, which lasted from 1894 to 1902, designing and contracting engineering works. After a meeting with Frank Gummow of Sydney in 1897, Anderson negotiated an agreement for the firm to became the Victorian agents for reinforced concrete using the Monier patents and won several contracts for bridges using the technology and he and Monash concentrated on building concrete bridges.(Joshua Thomas Noble Anderson (1865-1949), Engineer A Biographical Sketch by Professor Brian E. Lloyd, Transactions of Multidisciplinary Engineering, IEAust, Volume GE23 1999)Move to New ZealandAnderson moved to New Zealand in 1902 after the company failed financially.(Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, Technology in Australia 1788-1988, Online edn, Australian Science and Technology Heritage Centre, Melbourne, 3 May 2000)Anderson was appointed as engineer with the Dunedin (New Zealand) Drainage Board in 1902 and continued to 1906. He then returned to Victoria to take up a post as Shire Engineer and engineering consultant for several local councils in different parts of Victoria. In the 1920s he acted as engineering consultant to Burley Griffin, on the design of the Cotter Dam and water supply system for the new capital at Canberra.(JOSHUA THOMAS ANDERSON, CIVIL, MINING & MECHANICAL ENGINEER) Later he was Consulting Engineer to the City of Richmond. He joined the  Institute of Engineers in 1890, and was President 1900-2 and in 1919. He joined the IEAust as a Corporate Member in 1926.

This vessel was built at Paisley, on the Clyde, by Messrs. Fullerton and Co., and measures 165 tons register, carrying 420 tons coal under hatches, on a draught of only ten feet. This was the most important item in the instructions of the directors in sending for a vessel that could convey or bring from Morpeth, on the Hunter River, a large cargo on a given draught, and they have been most fortunate in securing a suitable craft in so short a time. In appearance the new steamer is a very fine wholesome vessel, having good ends, with a moderately flat floor. She is reported an excellent sea boat, and her outward passage speaks for itself with respect to her speed. The engines, which are on the compound surface condensing principle, are of 45 horse power , they are exceedingly strong but are so compact that they appear lost in the well ventilated and spacious engine room, but, although small in appearance, they are most effective, and can with ease drive the ship ten knots per hour on the small consumption of 3 1/2 tons per day She left England with 336 tons of coal, and has now on board about 40 tons, and has been under steam seventy eight day. These facts speak for themselves, and show that the Merksworth is all that could be desired. She is supplied   with two steam winches worked by a small donkey engine, which is placed in one corner of the stokehole, and she can work three hatch ways at once. The cabin accommodation, necessarily only on a limited scale, but quite sufficient for the requirements of her officers. The machinery is in perfect working order, and, with the exception of cleaning the hull, the vessel is ready to commence work at once. With reaped to her passage, we learn that she left Cardiff on December 2, steaming for the of Good Hope. The Equator was crossed at. Longitude 10 W, and she carried along S E. track to TableY Ey, which was reached on the 12th January. Having watered, etc, she left again on the 18th January, and ran down her easting on a parallel between latitude 39 and 42 S, with moderate winds and weather, passing the meridian of Otway on 21st instant. She has been under steam the whole voyage, which has been accomplished in 85 days (from pilot to pilot).(The Sydney Morning Herald Friday 26 February 1875)Career for the Anvil Creek Company Colliery at Morpeth February 1875 to July 1876 The Vessel started trading between the Hunter Coal Fields and Sydney with her first trip from Morpeth describedIn a late issue we stated that the berth at the Queens Wharf, Morpeth, was being prepared for the reception of steam colliers. On Sunday night the Merksworth, the first of these, arrived at Morpeth, and commenced to load Anvil Creek coal on Monday morning at six oclock. She cleared for Newcastle in the evening with 284 tons on board. The Merksworth, we are informed, belongs to the Anvil Creek company (The Maitland Mercury & Hunter River General Advertiser Thursday 5 August 1875 )The vessel had several hardships during a passage from Wollongong to Melbourne The steamer Merksworth, which arrived at Melbourne yesterday, from Wollongong, had a protracted passage, and during it the vessel was more than once in anything but a pleasant position for those who were on board. She left Wollongong on the 12th, and on the 14th a tremendous gale set in attended with a high cross sea, in which she laboured heavily, and shipped a great deal of water. A fearful sea struck the steamer till half-past 8 a.m., and brought it and the ventilators down on the deck. The steam-whistle also got damaged, and the steam escaped out of the boilers. The vessel then became unmanageable, and large bodies of water got down through the flue and ventilators to the stoke-hole. At 4 p.m. Captain Owen managed to get the vessel before the sea, and with the valuable assistance Mr. Miller, the chief engineer, the cover of the steam heater was placed over the flue, and one of the ventilators was used as a funnel. By 6 a.m. steam enough was obtained to enable the Merksworth to get into Bay where she anchored at 4 pm. on the 14th, and left again on the 15th, rounding Howe at 9 p.m. on that day. At 2 a.m. On the 17th another muzzier in the shape of a hard south-west gale was encountered, and, there being a high sea on, great quantities of water were shipped, and little or no headway was made. At 8 a.m. Captain Owen bore up for shelter under the Howe, and rounded the Cape at 2 p.m. but as the weather then abated he again made a made for Melbourne. At 6 p.m., however, the weather broke out with increased fury, and in consequence of the strong head wind and sea, and the air-pump being out of order, the steamer put back, to Twofold Bay, and anchored there at 2 p.m.After repairing the pump another start was made at 3 a.m. on the 18th, and fine weather prevailed until 1pm. on the l8th, when a heavy gale  from the NW sprung up off Promontory, and at 5pm. the. Merksworth put into Waterloo Bay, where she sheltered. Until 7 pm and then resumed her passage, cleared the fines and made every preparation for hard steaming. Phillip heads were entered at 1p.m. on Tuesday (The Sydney Morning Herald Thursday 29 June 1876 )The Vessel was then sold to the Bulli company for 11,500 in July 1876 (The South Australian Advertiser Wednesday 26 July 1876 )Career for the Bulli Coal Company July 1876 to March 1893 The Merksworth then mainly moved Coal from Bulli through to Sydney often in partnership with the WonioraIn December 1878 the vessel and its crew became involved in industrial actionThe Seamens Union Committee report that the seamen and firemen of the Bulli Coal Co.s steamers Woniora and Merksworth struck work yesterday, in consequence of the Companys hulk being taken alongside the A. S. N. Co.s steamer Wentworth, with the intention of supplying that vessel with coal. It was also rumoured, last night that the crew of the steamer Havilah had left that vessel, because she had been taken alongside the A. S. N. Co.s steamer Brisbane. The Woniora left Sydney for Bulli yesterday with a Chinese crew.(The Sydney Morning Herald Tuesday 24 December 1878 )In Early October of 1880 the vessel became involved in the rescue of the steam launch Lightning (35ft. long, and between 6ft. and 7ft. beam ) the Lightning had been purchased from River, Bay, for service on the River Derwent in Tasmania and when the Lightning was leaving Botany Bay the vessel was abandoned. The Lightning was then later picked up by the Merksworth off Botany Heads, and towed back into the Bay and then later towed the Lightning to Sydney to claim large salvage.(The Mercury Monday 11 October 1880 )A Day after this incident the steam collier Merksworth ran on to the South Reef in Jackson at night, and received some damage causing the vessel to be beached at Watsons Bay, and then refloated and towed into dock for repairs.(The Maitland Mercury & Hunter River General Advertiser Tuesday 12 October 1880 )During March of 1881 the ship steward, James McKellar was taken to the Infirmary suffering from injuries to his head, received through falling down the after-hold. After the accident McKellar did not appear to be much injured, but the next day as the vessel was about to go to sea, the master deemed it advisable to have him removed as he was considered as very dull in his manner.(The Sydney Morning Herald Tuesday 8 March 1881 )During December of 1882 William Miller, the master of the vessel pleaded guilty, and was fined 5 and costs for failing to stretch a tarpaulin so as to prevent the coal from falling into the harbour between the vessel and the Potosi from which coal was being loaded on to.(The Sydney Morning Herald Saturday 9 December 1882 )Just 7 months later the Master William Miller was again having legal issues as he was summoned by John Hammar a former crew member. Miller received a fine of 10s , and 27s 6d costs, for not supplied the former crew member with a proper discharge thus preventing him from shipping on another vessel (The Sydney Morning Herald Wednesday 25 July 1883 )In January of 1887 a large strike began to take hold in the Illawarra coal mines and the vessel was used to convoy workers from Sydney to help break the strike at the mineFill out more info on the Illawarra coal strikeIn April of 1887 the Merksworth was involved with a slight Collision with the Illawarra at Robertson Basin whenThe Illawarra was .lying at her usual berth, loading for Sydney, and with a good number of passengers and friends were on board, when the Merksworth, in ballast, entered, the basin. Whether .the engines were not stopped in time or the vessel failed to answer her helm is not known, but the Merksworth instead, of slowing forged slowly ahead and struck the Illawarra on the forward sponson, which was crushed and caused a dent in one or two plates. The Merksworth was moving so slowly that it was thought that she would come to a standstill before approaching the Illawarra, but she had just enough way on to cause the damage described. Had the impetus been a little more the Illawarra would have been crippled.(The Sydney Morning Herald Friday 29 April 1887 )The Merksworth was placed up for auction in February 1889 but was passed in (The South Australian Advertiser Friday 22 February 1889 )As the vessel failed to sell the Bulli Coal Company the sent the vessel in to be refurbished with Both engines and hull have been carefully examined and thoroughly repaired. She has also been fitted with a new steel boiler 10ft 3in in diameter and 9ft 6in long. It weighs 15 tons, and was tested by the Government engineer to 140 lb per square inch. The whole of the work, including the construction of the boiler, has been carried   out by Messrs Grant Brothers, of Pyrmont, New South Wales, in the most creditable manner. The Merksworth was taken for the usual official trial, under steam yesterday, and resulted in attaining   an average speed of 9 1/2 knots with 70 lb steam 25 vacuum, the engines doing 80 revolutions. Mr Hamilton, the companys manager, and Mr Pollock, the superintending engineer, warmly complimented Messrs Grant on the efficiency of the work done and Mr Cruickshank also ex pressed himself as being highly satisfied. The ship is now (both in hull and machinery) in good seagoing order.(The Sydney Morning Herald Saturday 19 October 1889 )During this refit a boilermaker named Thomas Harrison, aged 21 years, residing in Wentworth Park-road, Glebe, New South Wales, was working at the side of the steamer, cutting rivets, when a piece of iron flew off and destroyed the sight of his left eye.(The Sydney Morning Herald Friday Tuesday 1 October 1889 )In January of 1893 whist delivering Coal to Nouma the Merksworth picked up the crew of the Peerless which had becalmed on 4th January, nine miles outside the reef and the current then sent the Peerless onto the reef, and after doing everything possible to save her, the crew of the Peerless took the boats.(The Sydney Morning Herald Friday Thursday 19 January 1893 )The Merksworth was sold as part of the liquidation of the Bulli Coal Company in March 1893 ( The Sydney Morning Herald Friday Tuesday 7 March 1893 )Career March 1893 to Sinking On the 29th of June 1896 The iron collier Merksworth collided with Bridge in Sydney and sustained considerable damage.She had discharged part of her coal cargo, and was endeavouring to go through the swing bridge when, owing to being light right at the stern, through the discharge of coal from the after hold, she became unmanageable and crashed into the bridge. The forward part of the steamer was badly damaged and the whole fore compartment was flooded. But for the forward bulkhead, which prevented the water getting into the hold, the vessel would have foundered. As it was she had to be berthed, and the remainder of her cargo is now being discharged.(The West Australian Tuesday 30 June 1896 )1896 Collision with the Ferry Manlythumb|250px|The Steamship Manly II that colided with the MerksworthFriday the 18th of December 1896, The Ferry Manly struck a sliding blow with the collier Merksworth which commenced to promptly start sinkingBetween 1 and 2 p m yesterday the steam collier Merksworth, bound from the Wallarah Coal Companys mine, laden with coal, was heading up the harbour making a course for Millers Point or somewhere about there, where she usually gets orders as to what wharf or ship she is to discharge her cargo at, when she met with a disastrous collision. She had rounded Bradleys Head, and was making an inside course to pass Pinchgut. Following her came the Manly Beach Companys new steamer Manly, one of the fastest ferry steamers in the harbour, and soon after passing Bradleys these two steamers, presumably under complete control, came so close that the one hit the other what is technically known as a sliding blow That graceful act proved sufficient for the struck ship to almost immediately sink, and cause an almost miraculous escape of her crew. It would, in the absence of the official reports and the official inquiry which the Marine Board must hold, be improper to speculate as to which ship was the offender. The fact remains that the well-found steam collier the Merksworth received such injury as ended her career for the time being in her particular sphere of usefulness. The accounts given by some of those who were aboard the Merksworth differ in minor details, though they are unanimous in that they were ahead until the nose of the Manly was poked into the midship part of their ship, smashing the bridge and some of the upper works It came as a surprise, and after realising that they had been struck nobody suggested that the blow was serious until the hissing caused by the inrush of water below into the boiler room was heard, and it came in quickly, for before the Merksworth could reach Kirribilli Point she was doomed, and the best that could be done was done under the circumstances, namely, head her for the nearest land and jam her head there, thus saving risking the lives of the men The other steamer, Manly, was by that time well up tho harbour on her way to the Manly wharf They hit us on our starboard side, said one of the crew of the Merksworth, and we didnt think there was much in it, but she has a projecting propeller head, and that must have rammed us underneath And that is the accepted theory of the cause of the sinking of the MerksworthAll were silent on the ferry-boat when official reports were asked for, but the passengers were less disposed to be reticent The thing was all done in a moment, said one  There was some whistling and singing out, but the hit was not a loud one, and we really thought the other boat was but little damaged Imagine when, after arriving in the city, we heard that the collier had sunk We had no idea of such a. thing As to who was in the right or the wrong I should be sorry to say Naturally we were a bit scared, and there was some excitement, but nothing very, sensational  On being seen by a reporter, the master of the Manly declined to make a statementThe steamer Merksworth lies a little to the westward of the entrance to Mosmans Bay Her stem is sticking a few feet above water on rock The stern is in eight fathoms on a sandy bottom A foot or so of her mizzenmast was visible yesterday afternoon, and a little more of the foremast, but the top of her funnel was at least 15ft under water A lot of boats were out in the evening to inspect the place in which the steamer sank, and, judging from the rugged formation of that part of the harbour, the idea forces itself on ones mind that it was a case of touch and go, of beaching or sinking in deep waterThe water police were quickly on the scene Inspector Hyem, in reply to an inquiry, said  It was lucky there were no lives lost We brought ashore eight of the crew, the captain and four others remained by the wreck The men brought their baggage, and they saved the Merksworth cat, s which seemed to have been a sort of pet on boardThe Manly, the new Steamer which originally was built for the now Co-operative Company and the name changed subsequent.) from Emancipator to Manly, was so little damaged that she continued her timetable service throughout the remainder of the day at the company s office it was stated that tile damage would he covered by 5The steam collier Merksworth was once a crack steamer on this coast carrying mails and passengers. like many other well-built ships, when she became a bit old her place was taken by younger, larger, and more imposing steamers she was launched at Paisley, Scotland, 22 years ago, an iron steamer of 270 tons, 10 horsepower nominal, and is now owned by the Wallarah Coal CompanyThe prime policy on the Merksworth is hold by the South British Insurance Company, with re insurances()The Vessel was then salvage over the next 6 weeks with some 300 tons of coal have been recovered from the ships holds, by divers sending up the coal from the after part and grab buckets being used for the fore hold.Three lifting slings were placed under the steamer by Captains Banks and Colonna () the vessel was refloated and taken to the Sutherland dockCaptain T. A. Capurn, of the harbour steamer Manly, had his certificate suspended for three months owing to the collision with the collier Merkswerth in the harbor () Shipwreck Event Maitland Gale Sinking Add more information Wreck Site & Wreckage The pilot steamer left from Newcastle and course took a N.E. half N. course, and when abreast of the spot where the Adderley was wrecked only last year the Merksworth was sighted drifting steadily but surely towards the fatal beach.THE VESSEL FOUNDERS - A few moments later, whilst those on board the pilot steamer were debating the best course to pursue, the Merksworth foundered. Suddenly she shipped one of those big green seas, and it was evident that she was doomed. The breakers dashed furiously over the stern, she gave a heavy lurch, and sank stern first. For a moment she assumed an almost upright position, only her bows being visible, and then she completely disappeared from sight into 10 fathoms of water. The Merksworth foundered in less than a minute after shipping the seas. Although it was very evident that the collier had been abandoned it was deemed prudent to make assurance doubly sure, and the lifeboat was towed in a circle round the scene of the disaster with a view to rescuing anyone who might perchance be aboard. A strict lookout was kept on all sides, but no one rose to the surface.SCENE OF THE DISASTER. The spot where the Merksworth founded was  about 10 miles in a northerly direction from  Nobbys, and about one and a quarter mile from the beachalmost abreast of the scene of the wreck of the Adderley. Had she continued to drift for half an hour longer she would have gone ashore on that portion of Stockton Beach between the scenes of the wrecks of the Adderley and Fitzroy (1897). Notwithstanding the rough weather the Galatea only occupied 1 hour in reaching the scene, and the time at which the collier foundered is given as 10.15 a.m..(The Sydney Morning Herald Monday 9 May 1898 )The Adderley was variously described as ashore at either on Stockton Beach, about 15 miles from Newcastle() or had the vessel proceeded six miles further north she would have struck the rocks at Morna Point(dateMonday 26 April 1897) Coincidently The Mareeba  also came ashore 11 year later close to the scene to where the barque Adderley was driven ashore, The Mareeba bound to Sydney, was towed past the very spot and then came to grief(dateSaturday 1 August 1908) Post Sinking Just 12 weeks after the sinking of the vessel and the death of Robert McIndoe his wife gave birth to a daughter at her residence, 37 Merriman street, Millers Point on the 11 of August, 1898 (dateWednesday 17 August 1898) While in September 1952 the sole survivor of the ship diedHe was Mr. Johan Simon Johanson, 82. He leaves a son and daughter. The storm caused 40 deaths, 29 of them among the crew and passengers of the steamer Maitland, and 11 of the Merksworths company. Many other small steamers and sailing ships were wrecked, blown ashore, or swept hundreds of miles off their courses.Mr. Johanson drifted in a lifeboat with other members of the crew for 24 hours after they abandoned ship. Exposure and exhaustion killed most. Mr. Johanson was cast ashore on Stockton Beach with two other seamen, both of whom died soon afterwards(dateWednesday 3 September 1952)  See also BooksSpecific to the sinking *Destination Never Reached New South Wales Shipwrecks by Max Gleeson 2004 ISBN 0975117807 pages 115-123 http://www.maxgleeson.com/ Further reading Online DatabasesNational Shipwreck Databasehttp://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/heritage/nsd/nsd_list.plAustralian Shipping - Arrivals and Departures 1788-1968 including shipwrecks http://www.ozships.net/ozships/Encyclopaedia of Australian Shipwrecks - New South Wales Shipwrecks http://oceans1.customer.netspace.net.au/nsw-main.html Other Online sourcesHistoric Australian Newspapers, 1803 to 1954 http://newspapers.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/home Books*Wrecks on the New South Wales Coast.

Water_resource_policy
This article is about water resource policy, its institutions, the policy making processes and major subdivisions rather than implementation or hydrology, irrigation, geography, fisheries management, implementation, the management of specific water projects or the purchase, ownership and conveyance of water law|water rights. Water resource management is the implementation of policy and is usually carried out over smaller political, spatial, and geographical domains than policy. It includes policy for regions, catchments, shared or transboundary water resources, and inter-basin transfers,Policy is a cause of management practices, but best management practices are identified, evaluated, modified and disseminated by policy making bodies(http://www.gwptoolbox.org/index.php?optioncom_tool&id1).  These policy issues may be subdivided by various means, but broadly concern either the identification, annexation, procurement, maintenance, protection, preservation, expansion of water supply and protection of its quantitative degradation through evaporative loss, water main breakage, waste or constraining qualitative degradation through direct pollution. Supply isnt just about water production, it is also about distribution infrastructure ( TakaDu p. 9 ) Technical issues of the worlds aging water infrastructure also includes origination and dissemination of best practices to deal with metering, control systems, and pressure management.Much of policy discussion involves management of competing interests in supply and polluting uses by and between different user classes, with some commentators projecting resource wars as demand exceeds supply throughout most of the globe. ( Halcrow p. 27 & etc) User classes of interest to policy making institutions and policy advocates include domestic, industrial, mining and agricultural facilities.(http://www.ecolex.org/ecolex/ledge/view/RecordDetails;document_Law%20on%20Water%20Resources%20Development%20(Law%20No.%2011%20of%201974)..html?DIDPFDSIjsessionid7DA28E1500FB24F295BD6F41E7070924?idLEX-FAOC001336&indexdocuments)Water resource policy issues are receiving increasing attention. ( name Halcrow http://www.futurewecreate.com/includes/0614Global%20Water%20Security%20PSC%2019%20Oct%20rev1.pdf)It is widely believed that water policy is entering a period of more or less permanent crisis,(http://www.gwp.org/Global/The%20Challenge/Resource%20material/IWRM%20at%20a%20glance.pdf) at least in some regions, and the chilling spectre of worldwide crisis at some point in the future.(http://www.voanews.com/english/news/usa/arts/Fight-for-Water-Hits-Crisis-Levels-Worldwide-118423974.html)Given the complexity of international law, national sovereignty and forecasted water shortages, attention is increasingly focused on various approaches to this complex subject matter.(http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20023193561.html) Organizations such as the Global Water Policy Project have sprung up to promote awareness and prod government and NGOs into heightened awareness of the problems.(http://www.globalwaterpolicy.org)Various jurisdictions at all levels from international down to small water districts regulate water resources to protect drinkability and agricultural uses from water pollution. Advanced industrial countries typically develope stringent rules which are disseminated worldwide through aid agencies and international agencies such as various departments of the United Nations. Within the developed nations, some localities have more highly developed water regulatory policy analysis, making and implementation bodies in place, due either to general social and ideological concerns or familiarity with specific, often problematic water quality problems.Global water resource policy objectives (overview)Planning is viewed as a means to* to address the raw need for water quantitatively* to protect water supply quantity* to regulate conflicts about water access and quality particularly to prevent possible political or military conflict.(In nations of all classes, conflict between urban and agricultural uses are expected to intensify, creating policy making challenges of increasing complexity.)

From Global Policy Forum)* to protect vulnerable populations from threats such as flooding and mosquito vector activity.* navigable water policy* use of waters as dwelling space (houseboats)* conversion of water resources into energy (hydro-electric)* extraction of food from water resources (fishing, aquafarming)* extraction of minerals including petroleumInstitutional participants Multilateral/UN A few high points in multilateral initiatives are as follows:The 1977 Mar del Plata United Nations Conference on Water was the first intergovernmental water conference, leading to the 1980 Declaration of the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade by the UN General Assembly.(http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/index.php?id92)The United Nations Environmental Program is a key institution housing water resource policy making agencies and disseminating best practices worldwide. This activity occurs at global, regional and national levels. This role has been enhanced by landmark policy directives:* UN General Assembly Resolution 3436 (XXX) Agenda 21* 1997 Nairobi Declaration on the Role and Mandate of UNEP and* 2000 Malm Ministerial Declaration adopted at the First Global Ministerial Environment Forum.(http://www.unep.org/law/)* At Earth Summit 2002 governments established targets for 2015 to improve access to safe drinking water. (http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/globalassess/en/ Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment 2000 Report )* In 2007 the World Bank developed a report series on Environment and Development (World Bank|Series on Environment and Development.|http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWAT/Resources/Env_Flows_Water_v1.pdf)which thereafter (2009)reported on Environmental Flows in Water Resources Policies, Plans, and Projects(Environmental Flows in Water Resources Policies, Plans, and Projects|World Bank|Series on Environment and Development.|http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWAT/Resources/Env_Flows_Water_v1.pdf) Bilateral Treaties between nations may enumerate rights and responsibilities. For instance, a treaty between Poland and Germany, An Agreement to establish cooperation on water resources management provides:*supply of drinking water of good quality,*protection of surface water,*supply of water to agriculture,*fight against water pollution. (http://www.ecolex.org/ecolex/ledge/view/RecordDetails;document_Agreement%20between%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany%20and%20the%20Republic%20of%20Poland%20on%20cooperation%20on%20water%20resource%20management.html?DIDPFDSIjsessionid7DA28E1500FB24F295BD6F41E7070924?idTRE-151959&indextreaties)The Permanent Court of International Justice adjudicates disputes between nations including water rights litigation.(http://www.ecolex.org/ecolex/ledge/view/SearchResults;DIDPFDSIjsessionid7DA28E1500FB24F295BD6F41E7070924?indexcourtdecisions&indexHitsParamtreaties%3A406&indexHitsParamdocuments%3A9769&indexHitsParamcourtdecisions%3A256&indexHitsParamliterature%3A2486&querywater&sortFieldscore) Non-profit NGO policy advocacy organizations Non governmental organizations may have consultative status at the UN. One such NGO is the World Water Council, an international multi-stakeholder platform established in 1996 to act at all levels, including the highest decision-making level...in protection, development, planning, management and use of water in all its dimensions...for the benefit of all life on earth. It was an outgrowth of the 1992 at the UNs International Conference on Environment and Development in Dublin and at the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit. The Council itself is mow based in the City of Marseilles.( Their website explains its multi-stakeholder basis as due to the fact that authority for managing the worlds fresh water resources is fragmented amongst the worlds nations, hundreds of thousands of local governments, and countless non-governmental and private organizations, as well as a large number of international bodies.Subsequently, in 1994, the International Water Resources Association (IWRA) organized a special session on the topic in its Eighth World Water Congress held in Cairo in November 1994, leading to creation of the World Water Council. (Ibid) Business water resource policy initiatives The World Business Council for Sustainable Development has engaged stakeholders in a process it refers to as in its H2OScenarios engaged in a scenario building.In June 2011 in Geneva, the Future of Water Virtual Conference, hosted by Dow Chemical, exchanged view on sustainable water issues. Notable presented included Peter Bell of Harvards Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations and David Abraham, CEO of ClearWater Initiative. Other sponsorships included Scientific American and Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company, a media firm. Issues raised included* water infrastructure monitoring,( name Takadu http://www.futurewecreate.com/includes/0615Water_Price_Innovation_Scarcity_TaKaDu.pdf) global water security, potential resource wars, (http://www.futurewecreate.com/includes/0614Global%20Water%20Security%20PSC%2019%20Oct%20rev1.pdf) interaction between water, energy, food and economic activity, the true value of distribution portions of available water and a putative investment gap in water infrastructure. ( name Halcrow)(http://www.futurewecreate.com/) It was asserted that climate change will impact scarcity of water but the water security presentation emphasized that a combined effect with population growth could be devastating.(Halcrow) Identified corporate water related risks include physical supply, regulatory and product reputation. (Halcrow p 23)This forum indicated policy concerns with* trade barriers* price supports* other subsidies** treatment of water as a free good creates underpricing of 98% of water ( Takadu p.2)* need to intensify debate* need to harmonize public/private sectors( Halcrow p 28)Structural constraints on policy makers Operational water management implements policy. These policies are implemented by organizational entities created by government exercise of the police power of the state. However, all such entities are subject to constraints upon their autonomy.(Poulantzas, Nicos. Political Power and Social Classes. NLB, 1973 (orig. 1968).) These constraints originate in the legitimacy demands of their constituents and also the conflicting constraints originating from  global and regional international entities, national government and state or provincial policy instruments such as treaties, laws, regulations and contracts.(^ Habermas, J. and Derrida, J. February 15, Or What Binds Europeans Together: A Plea for a Common Foreign Policy, beginning in the Core of Europe in The Derrida-Habermas Reader ed. Thomassen L. The University of Chicago Press: Chicago Ill. Pp. 270-277. P.302) These factors affect ownership and control of water resources all the way down to the level of municipalities and special districts for flood control and allocation of water rights in accordance with local water law.  In many localities, structural limitations on policy making and resulting implementation snarls lead to failed policies.  (Collapse of an Industry: Nuclear Power and the Contradictions of U.S. Policy (Cornell Studies in Political Economy)John L. Campbell)Jurisdictional limitationsSubject matter and geographic jurisdiction are distinguishable.(Blacks Law Dictionary) Jurisdiction is limited by geographic political boundaries as well the limits imposed by enabling legislation.In some cases, legislation targets specific types of land uses (wilderness,agricultural,urban-residential, urban-commercial, etc.) A second level of jurisdictional limitation exists in terms of the subject matter which any given agency is authorized to control such as flood control, water supply and sanitation, etc. This creates a situation where regulatory authority is fragmented and thus policy analysis at a higher level is in demand in order to coordinate and identify gaps. Policy consistency requirements * Consistency with national regulations* Consistency with the interests of other lawful authorized users who engage in permitted or unpermitted practices which may utilize excessive water or degrade water quality.Overlapping jurisdictions and conflict of lawsIn typically water challenged province in a developed nation, the number of water regulatory agencies at the provincial level alone is substantial, not counting  county, city and special districts:* Environmental Protection Agency (State/EPA) Jurisidictional problems Overlapping jurisdictions may pass legislation which creates conflict of laws. For interest, recent changes in California law intended to reduce air quality problems from shipping has been interfered with by Federal legal changes intended to reduce the cost of shipping. ( www.santabarbaraindependent.com|July 2, 2011) Example of various overlapping water agencies* Coastal Commission* Coastal Conservancy* Department of Fish & Game* Department of Water Resources* Environmental Resources Evaluation System (CERES)* Ocean and Coastal Environmental Access Network (OCEAN)* Resources Agency Wetlands Information System*State Water Resources Control Board(http://www.megalaw.com/ca/top/cawater.php)**The Water Quality Control Policy for the Enclosed Bays and Estuaries of California is published by the State Water Resources Control Board as guidelines to prevent water quality degradation.  The policy is revised as needed.(State Water Resources Control Board Water Quality Control Policy for the Enclosed Bays and Estuaries of California (1974) State of California)* Public Health Departments conduct water sampling for bacterial and viral contaminants* Water districts control service to residential, commercial, industrial and institutional water consumers NGO to government difficulties Government secrecy is an ongoing problem as bureacratic ineptitude and illicit, privately profitable arrangements are shielded from public view. In some nations there are provisions for press and other NGO access but costly lawsuits may be required to exercise these rights.Typical information access issue As reported on the non partisan Civil Society Institute website, a  2005 Congressional study on water supply impact of American production is apparently being suppressed as it has become the target of a Freedom of Information Action (FOIA) litigation filed by the Civil Society Institute (CSI) vs the Department of Energy (DOE) and U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu.(Website of the Civil Society Institute|June 23, 2011|http://www.civilsocietyinstitute.org/media/062311release.cfm) Issues of concern to policy makers Flood controlWater can become a natural disaster in the form of coastal or inland manifestations. These include tsunami, hurricane,cyclone, rogue wave and storm surge or floods originating from terrestrial water - bursting dams, rivers overflowing their banks. Planning and prevention of floods is a part of water resource policy which is separated from ordinary water resource management designed to allocate supply and provide for sanitation.Invasive species controlInvasive species have become a serious problem in many areas. For instance, the Great Lakes of the US are threatened by carp and parts of the Western US by invasive mussels.Multi-jurisdictional issuesOne jurisdictions projects may cause problems in other jurisdictions, causing untold grief to all concerned. For instance, Monterey County California controls a body of water which acts as a reservoir for San Luis Obispo County. Who pays for measures to restrict growth of Quaaga Mussels? The down stream jurisdiction will face expensive damage to their piping systems if things get out of control, but boaters in the upstream jurisdiction will infect the lake if they are not subject to education and enforcement programs, which cost money. Similar examples abound.FreshwaterWater supply Surface and groundwater Surface water and groundwater have often been studied and managed as separate resources, although they are interrelated.(United States Geological Survey (USGS). Denver, CO. Ground Water and Surface Water: A Single Resource. USGS Circular 1139. 1998.) There are three recognized classifications of groundwater which jurisdictions may distinguish: subterranean streams, underflow of surface waters, and percolating groundwater.(http://www.blm.gov/nstc/WaterLaws/california.html) Policy makers freshwater constituenciesDrinking water and water for utilitarian uses such as washing, crop cultivation and manufacture is competed for by various constituencies:* residential* Agriculture. Many rural people practice subsistence rain fed agriculture as a basic livelihood strategy, and as such are vulnerable to the impacts of drought or flood that can diminish or destroy a harvest.

The sea is also a venue for shipping and for extractive exploitation for oil and minerals which creates a need for resource regulatory policy to protect the foregoing values from detrimental effects.Detrimental practices of concern to regulatorsPollution from shippingBallast water, fuel/oil leaks and trash originating from ships is a growing concern in terms of water pollution in addition to other concerns. Sources may include.* cruise ships* tankers* bulk cargo carriersBallast water may contain toxins, invasive plants, animals, viruses, and bacteria.Pollution from extractionOil rigs and undersea mineral extraction creates a host of regulatory and resource management problems as demonstrated by high profile oil spills such as Deepwater Horizon. Also, decommissioning of such operations presents policy challenges. Rigs to reefs is a proposal which has as yet failed to reach consensus. Californias Tranquillon Ridge project met its demise in the aftermath of Deepwater Horizon, and was controversial as environmentalists covenanted with the oil industry to open Californias waters up to offshore drilling in exchange for early termination of existing Federal oil leases. Sanitation and water quality issues Surface water (runoff)  and wastewater discharge Such regulatory bodies as exist cover designated regions (http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/waterboards_map.shtml) and regulate piped waste water discharges to surface water which include riparian and ocean ecosystems. These systems of review bodies are charged with maintenance maintaining a healthy aquifer for purposes of wilderness ecology (wildlife habitat,drinking water, agricultural irrigation and fisheries. Another area of regulatory attention, which may or may not be housed within the same regulatory structure, includes storm water discharge which tend to carry fertilizer residue and bacterial contamination from domestic and wild animals. (http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/ciwqs/who_is_regulated.shtml) They have the authority to make orders which are binding upon private actors such as international corporations (http://www.dailybreeze.com/news/ci_17612147) and do not hesitate to exercise the police powers of the state.  Water agencies have statutory mandate which in many hurisdictions is resilient to pressure from constituents and lawmakers in which they on occasion stand their ground despite heated opposition from agricultural interests(http://www.montereyherald.com/local/ci_18314090?nclick_check1)On the other hand, the Boards enjoy strong support from environmental concerns such as Greenpeace,Heal the Ocean and Channelkeepers.(http://www.facebook.com/notes/heal-the-ocean/hilary-spoke-to-regional-water-quality-control-board-today/10150089482817928)Water quality issues or sanitation concerns reuse or water recycling and pollution control which in turn breaks out into stormwater and wastewater. Stormwater runoff control policy Surface runoff is water that flows when heavy rains do not soak (infiltrate) soil; excess water from rain, meltwater, or other sources flowing over the land.  This is a major component of the water cycle.(Robert E. Horton, The Horton Papers (1933))(Keith Beven, Robert E. Hortons perceptual model of infiltration processes, Hydrological Processes, Wiley Intersciences DOI 10:1002 hyp 5740 (2004)) Runoff that occurs on surfaces before reaching a Channel (geography)|channel is also called a Nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint source. Such sources often contain man-made contaminants, the runoff is called nonpoint source pollution.  When runoff flows along the ground, it can pick up Soil contamination|soil contaminants including, but not limited to petroleum, pesticides, or fertilizers that become discharge (hydrology)|discharge or nonpoint source pollution.(L. Davis Mackenzie and Susan J. Masten, Principles of Environmental Engineering and Science ISBN 0-07-235053-9)( Adapted for this section, including citations herein, from open source CCL 2.0 main article at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormwater) At a policy level, political groups aggregate at such policy making entities as will hear their claims. Thus, in democratic jurisdictions with relatively open access to citizen participation, agricultural interests, developers, fish and wildlife groups, and environmentalists will compete for policy maker attention and for implementation of their preferred policy options. (http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/instream_flows/docs/not_wdm070111.pdf) Wastewater Wastewater is water which has been discharged from human use; water that has been adversely affected by anthropogenic influence. ( Section adapted from main topic Wikipedia article at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater CCL 2.0 Originating editor TakuyaMurata) The primary sources are discharge from the following sources:* domestic residences,* commercial properties,* industry,* agriculturePotential contaminants exist in varying concentrations and new ones are found on an ongoing basis}. Sewage is technically wastewater contaminated with fecal and similar animal waste byproducts, but is frequently used as a synonym for waste water. Origination includes cesspool and sewage outfall pipes, some of which are unpermitted . Water treatment policy Water treatment is usually a matter of implementation however it is subject to multiple overlapping jurisdictional constraints which limit the governmental autonomy ( Poulantzas, Nicos.

VIOLIN_vaccine_database
The Vaccine Investigation and OnLine Information Network (VIOLIN) is the largest wet-based vaccine database and analysis system (). VIOLIN currently contains over 2,700 vaccines or vaccine candidates for over 170 pathogens. The vaccine information in the database is collected by manual curation from over 1,600 peer-reviewed papers. Different from most existing vaccine databases, VIOLIN focuses on vaccine research data. Different types of information is curated, including vaccine name, license status, antigens used, vaccine adjuvants, vaccine vectors, vaccination procedure, host immune response, challenge procedure, vaccine efficacy, adverse events, etc. All vaccine information in the VIOLIN vaccine database is supported by quoted references. The data generated by a curator is published only after a careful review and approval by a vaccine domain expert.     In addition, VIOLIN includes many vaccine analysis programs. For example, VIOLIN includes Vaxign (http://www.violinet.org/vaxign), the first web-based vaccine design program based on the strategy of reverse vaccinology (). Vaxign has been tested in different pathogen models, including uropathogenic E. coli and Brucella spp.VIOLIN also maintains the official web page for the development of community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) (http://www.violinet.org/vaccineontology). VO is a formal biomedical ontology in the domain of vaccine and vaccination. VO is targeted for vaccine data standardization and integration, and supporting automated reasoning. VO has been shown to enhance vaccine literature mining ().External links*Official siteReferences

Campus_of_Michigan_Technological_University
thumb|300px|Campus view from Mont RipleyTechnological Universitys campus sits on 925 acres (374 ha) on a bluff overlooking Portage Lake.Campuses and buildings The main Michigan Tech campus is located mainly on US 41 in Houghton, Michigan. It is the safest campus in Michigan, and the third safest in the United States according to Readers Digest.() Many of the buildings are built up, as opposed to short and wide, which reduces the size of the campus. Michigan Tech also maintains the following areas:*Ford Forestry Center and Research Forest in Michigan*Keweenaw Research Center at the Houghton County Airport near Hancock (site of vehicle testing, the Winter Driving School)(http://www.mtukrc.org/)*Portage Lake Golf Course in Portage Township*Ripley ski hill in Michigan*The Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI) in Ann Arbor*Former UPPCO Building in Houghton(http://www.admin.mtu.edu/urel/news/media_relations/662/)*Several forest areas including: Swedetown Tract, Nara Property, Dow Tract, and Wilkinson Tract*A small campus near Delhi, India, opened in 2003. In addition, the offices of the Michigan Tech Fund are located in the Citizens Bank Building in Hancock.(http://www.admin.mtu.edu/rbb.html) Other office areas are at the UPPCO building in Houghton. Faculty are involved in several education programs, with clients such as General Motors. The Portage Lake Golf Course opened for play in April 1902.  In 1945 the members could no longer support the needs of the course and sold it to Michigan Tech for the amount of one dollar.  Since then many different improvements have been made such as the addition of another nine holes in 1969.  Then in 1984 the new clubhouse was constructed in place of the original clubhouse.  In 1996 a sprinkler system was installed to modernize the course and keep it playable.  The Portage Lake Golf Course is located only a few miles from the Michigan Tech campus on US-41. Academic buildingsChemical Sciences and Engineering BuildingThe Chemical Sciences and Engineering Building, Chem Sci for short, was completed in 1969 and originally housed the Chemical Engineering, Chemical, Metallurgy, Biological Sciences, and Humanities departments. It replaced the second oldest building on campus, the materials processing laboratory, which had housed the shops for several engineering departments. Since the building has existed, it has had only a few accidents, the most notable two being a ventilation problem causing lead fumes to build up in the labs and the explosion of a batch of volatile chemicals being used in a polymer synthesis process which nearly killed a research assistant, Michael Abbott. Chem Sci was built for easy modification of key systems in order to keep up with the needs of the lab facilities. One example of this is the design of the ventilation system, which was placed on the outside of the building and covered in the same red brick as the rest of the structure for easy access during renovations.(Michigan Technological University Archives & Copper Country Historical Collections Vertical File: Buildings-Chemical Metallurgy) Dow Environmental Sciences and Engineering BuildingMichigan Technological University proposed to begin the construction of an environmentally friendly building in the summer of 1996. The academic and research programs had grown tremendously, so MTU needed to expand. The building would not only be a valuable upgrade to the students of MTU, but also to the environmental engineering students, geology, biology, and forestry programs. The primary goal of the building was to help all MTU graduates become environmentally literate, providing leadership for a sustainable future. The building became known as the Dow Environmental Sciences and Engineering Building. The estimated cost of the Dow building was around $44 million. MTU was not able to cover the entire cost of the construction of the building, so they needed to find other sources of income. On May 12, 1993 the Michigan Governors Office announced that they would be able to contribute $30 million to the project. This meant that MTU needed to fund the other half of the costs. Much of the funds to build the Dow building came from donations. MTU is a public university, so many of their buildings are funded by donations made by alumni, companies, and anonymous funds. The Dow building currently houses the biology learning center, an exterior solar space- by setting the building back, designers created a courtyard to screen northern winds, making it 10 degrees warmer in all seasons, natural lighting and ventilation, and a rooftop greenhouse for biology research. All of these innovations were a part of the environmentally friendly way of construction. Most, if not all of the faculties offices are faced with windows to create natural light. This helps the university to not only save money, but to help reduce their carbon footprint.(Michigan Technological University Archives & Copper Country Historical Collections Vertical File: Buildings-Dow) The Electrical Energy Resource CenterCenter and campus sign on US 41The EERC is home to both the Department of Electrical Engineering and Michigan Tech Telecom services.The EERC was built starting in 1974 and opened in 1976, with energy in mind throughout the design.  At the buildings groundbreaking in 1974, R.L. Smith (president of Michigan Tech at the time) described the buildings intended use in terms of energy, stressing the importance of educating the next generation of engineers to learn to use and transport energy efficiently.(Smith, RL. Electrical Resources Building Groundbreaking Ceremony.  Event Program, 1 February 1974. Vertical File: Buildings - EERC.  MTU Archives and Copper County Historical Collection.) At the time of its construction, the EERC was described as having a strikingly modern design (Electrical Resources Center Started.  Michigan Tech Alumnus, March/April 1974. Vertical File: Buildings - EERC.  MTU Archives and Copper County Historical Collection.) by some and basically cement, brick, glass and steel(Construction progresses on Michigan Tech High Rise.  Daily Mining Gazette, 15 August 1975. Vertical File: Buildings - EERC.  MTU Archives and Copper County Historical Collection.)  by others.  The building was designed to be energy efficient, hence the lack of large windows on the east and west faces (windows are a major source of heat loss).In building the EERC, several previous buildings were demolished including Sperr Hall and Hotchkiss Hall Only part of Hotchkiss Hall was demolished to build the EERC and the rest was brought down after equipment and personnel had moved into the EERC.( The Seaman Mineral Museum, named in honor of Professor Arthur Edmund Seaman who was the head of the Michigan Tech geology department from 1899-1928,(News from Michigan Tech, 1961. Print. Vertical File, Michigan Tech University Archives.) was located on the fifth floor of EERC building in Michigan Tech until 2011.() Before the EERC building was constructed, the museum was housed in Hotchkiss Hall.(Vast Mineral Collection at Tech, Daily Mining Gazette, February 4, 1987. Print. Seaman Museum Vertical File, Michigan Tech Archives.) The museum opened in its current location on June 17, 1976.(From Farm Boy to World Energy Leader Walker Cisler to Give Dedication Address at MTU, Michigan Tech Today, June 15, 1976. Print. EERC Vertical File, Michigan Tech Archives.) The museum displays the importance and beauty of minerals and its significance to development of Michigan over 150 years ago. The museum also educates people about the value of mineralogy and geology, and helps promote a better understanding of the need to protect specimens.(State of Michigan 11 Apr. 1990. Print. The House of Representation & the Scuate, Vertical File, Michigan Tech University Archives.) In 2011, the museum moved out of the EERC to near the Technology Development Complex on campus.Kanwal and Ann Rekhi HallAlso known as Rekhi Hall, this building is the home of the MTU Computer Science department. Funded by the donation of Kenwal and Ann Rekhi the facility opened in 2005. Providing several new classrooms and research laboratories the facility is considered state of the art. Kenwal Rekhi is a Michigan Tech Alumni from the class of 1969. R.L. Smith Mechanical EngineeringEngineering Mechanics BuildingThe R.L. Smith Mechanical EngineeringEngineering Mechanics Building (also known as the MEEM) is semi-famous for being the second tallest building in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The buildings first floor interior consists largely of The Fishbowl, a large, glass-enclosed computer lab, mainly for Mechanical Engineering students. U.J. Noblet Forestry and Wood Products BuildingOriginally built in 1967, the U. J. Noblet Forestry and Wood Products Building was expanded in 2000 with the addition of Horner Hall and the Hesterberg Atrium.  The building is constructed mostly of wood, including wood murals that reflect the subject taught by the School of Forest Resources and Environmental Science. A Rhizotron is also housed in this building that allows undergraduates to complete non-invasive studies of underground processes that involve root systems, decomposition, organisms, and bacteria.  The Rhizotron is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service research station located on campus.Non-academic buildingsStudent Development ComplexThe Student Development Complex (S.D.C.) was built in 1980. The gun range was built as part along with the rest of the S.D.C. in 1980. Built to handle any cartridges that have a muzzle velocity of up to   per second, the range is also used for archery shooting.(personal email from Zach Simpson, President,Competition Rifle Team) Today, there are three organizations that operate out of the range: the Pistol Club (MTU and Pratical), the Competition Rifle Team, and the Archery Club. There are also several P.E. and ROTC classes that use the range. Michigan Tech hockey is currently played in the SDC.  However Tech used to play at the Amphidrome. Unfortunately the Amphidrome burnt to the ground in 1927.  In its place the New Amphidrome was built in 1928, the New Amphidrome has been renamed to the Dee Stadium.  Tech continued to play at the Dee Stadium until the MacInnes Student Ice Arena was built in 1972. Advanced Technology Development ComplexThe Advanced Technology Development Complex (A.T.D.C.) was built in 2004. It is a  building that houses the Ford Student Design Center, the Keweenaw Research Centers dynamometer, and lease space for business start-ups.() The Ford Student Design Center gives students in the Enterprise and senior design programs shop space to put ideas into practice. Residence halls and apartments*Douglass Houghton Hall, commonly called DHH, is the smallest and oldest residence hall at Michigan Technological University. It was built in 1939 when the schools enrollment was reaching 800 and the surrounding community could no longer accommodate the population increase. Douglass Houghton Hall was the first residence hall constructed on the Michigan Tech campus. It was completed in 1939, over 40 years after the campus opened. The hall was called the Tech Dormitory for its first year, but was then renamed after Houghton, one of the first geologists in the area.(Nordberg, Erik. Douglass Houghton Hall. Alumnus from the Archives (2004): 30-31.) The symmetry of the building was compromised in 1943 with the war-time construction of the tower, which since has been retrofitted to house the majority of the elevator mechanism.  The hall originally housed 200 students, but in 1948 an addition was built on to the buildings east side to house an additional 175 students when, once again, the schools enrollment increased.(Dorm Addition to House 175; Ready in April. Daily Mining Gazette Houghton 24 Mar. 1948.)  The hall was built using materials from the local area.  Included in this was copper used to build the roof as well as handmade light fixtures.  Solid oak paneling was also used for the interior.(Douglas Houghton Hall, An Historical Perspective.http://www.housing.mtu.edu/housing/historical_documents.html) Douglass Houghton Hall was an all mens hall until the early seventies when it became the second residence hall at Michigan Tech to become coed.(Hooker, Chuck. DHH Goes Coed...? The Lode Houghton 18 Feb. 1971.) *Wadsworth Hall is a coed dormitory that currently houses approximately 1,100 students. When the dormitory was first built it could only accommodate 356 people, but two additions have been made to the building since its opening. The dormitory was built in 1955 and is named after Dr. Marshman E. Wadsworth, who was president of Michigan Tech from 1887 to 1898. Wadsworth Hall is commonly referred to by its residents as Mother Wads and others as Wads.(Tech dorm named after Dr. Wadsworth. The Week That Was 22 June 1956) Wadsworth Hall was renovated in December 2003 and the project was completed in the fall of 2005. The renovation of Wadsworth Hall cost around $31.3 million. The project updated all the plumbing and electrical wiring throughout the building. It also updated the layout of the building to give the students more privacy, a better community bathroom, and kitchenettes where students could study, cook, and socialize.  The renovations also resulted in an updated cafeteria; the layout was changed from one long line of food to an open-market type of cafeteria, which reduced waiting in line for food.(Fosnes, Kelly. New Wads unveiled Mining Gazette 21 November 2005) *McNair Hall has 650 rooms and the complex consists of three buildings; East McNair, West McNair, and a connecting dining services building. It was the third dormitory built, opening in 1968. It was originally named the Co-ed Hall, as its intent was to attract more women to the predominantly male university. The name was later changed, in 1993, to McNair Hall, after the second president of Michigan Tech.() *The Daniell Heights Apartments, often referred to as The Heights, were built in the early 1960s to provide living space for staff, faculty and students on campus.  Located behind Hillside Place, this large complex holds 350 apartments.  It is funded completely by its residents and offers a relatively inexpensive housing option.() As of Fall 2010, with the completion of Hillside Place, Daniell Heights is used primarily for graduated student, faculty, and staff housing. *Hillside Place was completed in Summer 2010. This six-story building houses four students per apartment, with individual rooms for each resident.  There is a common kitchen and living area, with two bathrooms inside every apartment. It serves graduate and undergraduate students who have completed at least one year at Michigan Tech.  Its amenities include a fitness center and lodge that has indoor and fireplaces and serves as an area for students to socialize.  It is located behind McNair Hall and Wadsworth Hall() Because of a very large incoming class in 2008, the Franklin Square Inn, a Western located in downtown Houghton, housed approximately 60 students through a two-year agreement with Housing and Residential Life.(http://www.housing.mtu.edu/fsi/) The completion of the construction of Hillside Place for the fall 2010 semester removed the need for this additional off-campus housing. The residence halls each have a council representing the students of that hall. The councils are: the Wadsworth Hall Student Association (WHSA), the McNair Hall Association (MHA), and the Douglass Houghton Hall Council (DHHC). The Inter-Residence Hall Council (IRHC) consists of members from all of these hall councils, as well as several at-large members, and represents all of the residents to the campus and community.Campus networkThe campus network at Michigan Tech is a continually evolving entity trying to keep up with the technology curve.  At its heart is an MX960 Ethernet Services Router from Juniper Networks.  This switch provides 10 gigabit ethernet connectivity for the backbone of the network.  Storage is handled by a 100 terabyte network-attached storage/storage area network (NAS/SAN) array.  Junos software is the primary software used for configuring the network.(http://www.juniper.net/us/en/local/pdf/case-studies/3520268-en.pdf) For students, there are two main networks in addition to whatever networks might be used in a computer lab.  The residence halls and university owned apartments have CAT5 ethernet connections running to every room.  These are part of the Resnet network.  There is also a wireless network (called Rovernet) that covers most of every building on campus.  Both of these networks require a login name and password provided by the university upon enrollment to connect to them.  The computer labs for the various departments run on their own networks and require the same login and password as Resnet and Rovernet but will only grant access to students registered for a class in that department or taking a major in that department.  University email is provided by Zimbra and again uses the standard login.  Along with standard email Zimbra also provides limited online document storage (in addition to a networked private H drive that all students have) and a built-in chat system.References

Cumborah,_New_South_Wales
Lightning RidgeCumborah is a small rural village in north-western South Wales, Australia, in Shire, near the opal fields of Lightning Ridge. Cumborah is about 36 km west of the Highway, and is served by the commercial centres of Lightning Ridge and Walgett which is 48 km to the south-east. The road through Cumborah is main route to the nearby Glengarry, Grawin and Sheepyard opal fields. Other prospectors also search nearby for agate, fossils, petrified wood, topaz and other semi-precious stones. The village is almost surrounded by mulga and cypress scrubland.PopulationIn the 2006 census Cumborah and the surrounding region had a population of 492 persons, 63.6% were males and 36.4% were females, including 33 indigenous persons and 386 persons born in Australia (78.5%). Their main form of employment was in sheep, beef cattle and grain farming (42.9%) followed by non-metallic mineral mining.(HistoryIn 1896 Cumborah was proclaimed a town and the local police station operated from 1898 until 1934. A small mail receiving office opened in 1892; this was upgraded to a post office in 1898 which was closed in 1963. The village had a provisional school from 1899 to 1903 and a public school from 1904 until 1943. A telephone office opened in 1901 and a manual exchange in 1912. By 1915 Cumborah had five telephone subscribers that could only contact Walgett or Dangar Bridge. From 1917 it was possible to telephone other local towns. Early entertainment in Cumborah was provided by participating in or watching cricket, horseracing, sports days and tennis.()In the 2006 Census there were 315 occupied private dwellings in Cumborah and the surrounding area: 80.0% were separate houses and 20.0% were other dwellings.(References

Morgan_Mansion
 refnum  79001867()The Morgan Mansion is a historic residence in and the current city hall of Wellston, Ohio, States.  Built in 1905,( it was the home of one of Jackson Countys leading industrialists, T.J. Morgan, and it has been designated a site.(Owen, Lorrie K., ed.  Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places.  Vol. 2.  St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999.)Morgan entered the iron and coal business in Wellston in 1884, when he established the Wellston Coal and Iron Company.  By 1905, he had become sufficiently wealthy to commission the design of his home from leading Columbus architect Wilbur Mills.(  Mills design was a brick building with a stone foundation, an asphalt roof, and elements of stone and iron.(Morgan Mansion, Historical Society, 2007.  Accessed 2011-06-21.)  Rather than being of a single style, the two-and-a-half-story house is a mix of Jacobethan and Spanish Mission Revival architecture.  The various structural elements combine to make the Morgan Mansion more architecturally significant than any other building in the city.(  Morgan himself died just three years after the house was erected.(Hull, Arthur M., and Sydney A. Hale, eds.  Coal Men of America: A Biographical and Historical Review of the Worlds Greatest Industry.  Chicago: The Retail Coalman, 1918, 468.)Thirty years after Morgan arranged for its construction, the house was purchased by the city of Wellston and converted into its city hall, a purpose that it continues to serve to the present day.(  In 1979, it was listed on the Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and its place as the home of a leading local citizen.(  It is one of three National Register-listed buildings in the city, along with the House, the home of another prominent mining executive,( and the Wells House,( the home of the citys founder.(State Board Recommends 10 Ohio Nominations to the National Register Of Historic Places, One To State Registry Of Archaeological And Historic Landmarks, Historical Society, 2008-12-08.

Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Wiesenburg
thumb | 240px | Wiesenburg Castle in Saxony gave its name to this branch of the ducal familyThe House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Wiesenburg was one of the many side-lines of the house of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg.  Although the members possessed the title and rank of a Duke, they only had inhertiance rights in Schleswig-Holstein and held no sovereign lands. Background The founder of the line was Philip Louis (16201689).  He bought the 1664 the District of Wiesenburg in the Erzgebirgskreis in Saxony with all its villages from Elector John George II of Saxony, but without sovereign privileges.  He invested in the mining industry in Schneeberg and Neustdtel. Initially, it appeared to be a failure, but in the 1670s he made large profits and became a wealthy minig entrepreneur.  In 1675, Philip Louis sold Castle, which he had renovated, with the surrounding land for  to his eldest son, Frederick (16511724), who served as an imperial lieutenant general in Hungary.  In 1686, Philip Louis bought Oberkotzau in Franconia from Margrave Christian Ernst of Brandenburg-Bayreuth.  He died in 1689 in Oberkotzau.His son Frederick was unhappily married with of Legnica-Brieg (16521707) until she divorced him in 1680.  He sold Wiesenburg in 1723 to his only son Leopold (16741744), who sold it on shortly after Fredericks death.  King II of Poland bought the castle in 1725 for .  Duke Leopold had reverted to Catholicism, and married Marie Elisabeth von und zu Liechtenstein (16831744).  He was a secret Imperial Councillor and Knight of the of the Golden Fleece (Nr.648).  He had five daughters and no male heirs.  The line of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Wiesenburg died out with Duke Leopold.

Brynmawr_and_Blaenavon_Railway
|}The Brynmawr and Blaenavon Railway was a railway line in Wales, within the historic boundaries of Brecknockshire and Monmouthshire, originally built in 1866 and immediately leased to the and North Western Railway to transport coal to the Midlands via the Heads of the Valleys line. The line was completed in the late eighteen sixties and the LNWR were operating passenger trains over the line by 1872. Eight years later it was extended to meet the Western Railway at Abersychan & Talywain. Here the line carried on down the valley through Pontypool Road Station to the coast at Newport. In 1922 the LNWR was grouped into the Midland and Scottish Railway. In later years the line saw a variety of GWR locomotives operating from pit to port, however the railway retained its LNWR infrastructure up until the very last days before its closure.From the turn of the century the line served mining activity centred on several pits and collieries. The branch served several collieries between Brynmawr and Waunafon. The first of these was the Waun Nantyglo colliery, which was situated a little east of a tramway which later carried the B4248 Brynmawr to Blaenavon Road. The connection was removed by 1925. As Waunafon was approached on a facing branch to the left was built, leading to Clydach colliery, but these had gone by 1915, to be replaced by New Clydach Colliery sidings. Vestiges of these remained until 1950. Some 300m south of Waunafon station a branch, built in 1870, veered to the West to serve the Milfraen Colliery. The space between the single platform station at Waunafon and the branch was occupied by a series of loops and sidings. In 1913 a small platform, called Garn-yr-Erw halt was built just north of the Whistle Road Bridge. This halt had no timetable for passengers as it was used only by miners.By 1938 Milfraen Pit had ceased production having exhausted its own coal reserves, the branchline that served it was removed in 1937. The line was closed to passengers, not during the Beeching Cuts which befell the GWR route to Blaenavon Low Level, but in 1941 due to the exigencies of the World War. Blaenavon shed closed in 1942 and eventually goods also ceased in 1954. The line was retained for wagon storage until 1953, and around 1950, a temporary siding was laid in connection with opencast workings on the Blorenge, branching east roughly at the point where the Milfraen Colliery branch had previously branched west. The declining situation continued through the 50s, then Varteg Hill subsequently closed in 1964 leaving Big Pit as the primary exporter of coal left. The once double track to Pontypool was then singled in June 1965. Although passenger and goods traffic had long ceased to Brynmawr the track was re-laid by the NCB to just south of Waunavon station again during the 1970s for the Black Lion Disposal Point washery. Locomotives The passenger services were operated by the GWR & the freight services by the LMS. An impressive variety of locomotives operated over the years on this line, including: *LNWR 0-6-2 Webb Coal Tanks*LNWR 0-8-4 Beames Tanks*GWR 0-6-0 Pannier Tanks*GWR 2-8-0 Class 42xx heavy freight locomotives*GWR 2-8-2 Class 72xx heavy freight locomotivesIn its BR days the line was solely operated as a mineral line although several specials operated passenger trips over the line in the late 1970s, leading to several unusual visitors :*Class 37 (the mainstay of the line in terms of motive power)*Class 25 (often double headed)*Class 31 (special trains)*Class 20 (special trains)*Class 45 (special trains)*Class 101 DMU (special trains)*Class 116 DMU (special trains) Closure and preservation Although the track along the whole route to Brynmawr was finally lifted in July 1961, the section from Blaenavon to Pontypool was still in use for coal trains from other local mines until Pit finally closed in 1980. The line from Cwmbran was dismantled right up to outside Blaenavon High Level station whilst the washery and other colliery buildings which were all but demolished during 1987. Much of the railway today has now become part of the National Cycle Network Route 46.In 1980 a heritage railway movement was started, and is now operated exclusively by volunteers who form the and Blaenavon Railway Company (1983) Ltd. and its support group the Pontypool & Blaenavon Railway Society. The society started running trains in the same year and have continued continuously for over twenty five years. The railway did not increase in track size for a quarter century after its opening, but increased as a going concern, with a larger number of volunteers, a larger amount of operational rolling stock, and more definite plans for the railways future. The Pontypool Blaenavon Railway Company was then granted an Order under the Transport and Works Act to extend and operate the line. In May 2010 the railway was extended towards the town of Blaenavon, the nearest town to the railways headquarters a distance of roughly a mile and a quarter, to the site of the former Blaenavon High Level station the London and North Western Railways once-terminus station in the town.Eventually, restoring and reopening the entire existing route from Brynmawr station to Pontypool Wainfelin marks the long term goal and aspirations of the society.

Anne OTate is able to perform such analysis and can process sets of up to 25,000 PubMed records.() DescriptionOnce a set of articles has been identified using Anne OTate with its PubMed-like interface and search syntax, the set can be analysed and words and concepts mentioned in specific fields (sections) of PubMed records can be displayed in order of frequency.() Fields which Anne OTate can display in this manner are:    Topics (MeSH) This option may help to identify possible Subject Headings  (known as MeSH terms, but called Topics by Anne OTate) for a subject for which no corresponding subject heading or entry term (cross-references to preferred MeSH term) exists or where PubMeds automatic mapping process (identifying a MeSH term and including it in a search formulation) fails. Searching for instance for articles on Knowledge Transfer (for which no correspnding MeSH or entry term exists) will retrieve a set of some 530 studies in PubMed (as of August 2011); Anne OTates analysis suggests that MeSH terms like Diffusion of Innovation or Information Dissemination may be suitable additional concepts to retrieve a more sensitive (comprehensive) set of references. This method of identifying possible MeSH terms is not available on PubMed. AuthorsThis option may help with identifying authors who have written frequently about a given subject, or may help with identifying possible experts or peer reviewers      JournalsIdentifying journals which publish papers on the subject under investigation may assist with selecting suitable journals to consider for manuscripts or for detailed scanning for relevant articles (hand searching()) not found by the search on PubMed.Other fieldsAuthor affiliations (addresses) and the years of publication can also be analysed.  Important words from titles and abstracts which may ... have more frequent occurrences in the result subset than in the MEDLINE as a whole, thus they distinguish the result subset from the rest of MEDLINE ()  can be identified and help with further refining a search on PubMed.()()() History Anne OTate (a pun on the word annotate) was developed by Neil R Smalheiser and a team of researchers from the of Chicago. It is part of the Arrowsmith Project, which developed tools such as Arrowsmith proper, a text-comparison application(), Adam, a database of medical abbreviations,(), and Author-ity (an author-disambiguation tool),() Compendium, a list of text mining tools, and Anne OTate. The Project is based on research led by R. Swanson at the of Chicago ()which hosted the original tool.()Further research was led by Neil R. Smalheiser at the of Illinois at Chicago, with funding from the Institutes of Health.()Other PubMed text-mining applicationsA wide range of text-mining applications for PubMed have been developed, () using their own interface, such as GoPubMed, ClusterMed, or PubReMiner. Only Anne OTate uses PubMeds standard interface, search syntax, and some of its functionality. References  External links *Anne OTate*PubMed Home Page*Medical Subject Headings Fact Sheet*

AD_OPT,_division_of_Kronos
AD OPT is the airline crew planning division of the U.S.-based multi-national human capital management software and services company Incorporated.() HistoryAD OPT was founded in 1987 by Franois Soumis and four other operational researchers from the decision analysis research group, GERAD, and the CRT (Centre de Recherche sur les Transports/ Research Center on Transportation) in Montreal, Canada. Originally, they worked on developing truck itinerary management software for mining companies.() It was only later that the company concentrated on developing software to manage crew planning (Altitude) and shift worker schedules (ShiftLogic).In 1999, the company was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) under AOP.With ShiftLogic, they later expanded their horizons into other industries including manufacturing, hospitality, and transportation, among others. In 2001, AD OPT purchased Total Care Technologies to include staff scheduling in the healthcare industry to their product list.()In 2004, AD OPT Technologies Inc. was acquired by Kronos Incorporated. This acquisition was part of Kronos expansion into the field of employee scheduling optimization.()  Kronos Workforce Management software that schedules hospital employees and AD OPTs ShiftLogic scheduling engines were going to be merged to create a more efficient product.()Today, AD OPT s operational research team maintains close ties with GERAD and its teams by funding some of their research projects in the aviation scheduling domain.() Crew Planning OptimizationThe goal of crew planning optimization is to solve for the best solution at the lowest cost to the airline. In other words, airlines would like to increase their productivity while minimizing crew costs and improving, as much as possible, crew quality of life. In order to plan their monthly schedules, airlines must consider operational limits, including but not limited to: country requirements, airport regulations, union rules and collective agreements. Before the era of technology, this process was completed by hand by a team of crew planners. Often they just attempted to make all their flights fit with the number of employees that were available. Crew planning optimization was then implemented to take all of the limits and some of the crew preferences into account. Using Research (OR) to develop mathematical tools, the optimizers build highly cost-efficient pairings and then assign these pairings in an efficient manner to the crew members (both in the cabin and cockpit). This technological advancement has proven to be an important cost-reducing tool for airlines and has significantly improved crew quality of life.AD OPTs Altitude Suite is composed of:* Altitude Insight* Altitude Pairing* Altitude PBS* Altitude Rostering* Altitude BLISS Optimization TechnologyThe software is powered by GENCOL, a general purpose column generation algorithm owned by AD OPT, designed to solve airline scheduling problems.() The column generation allows the software to produce real-life scheduling solutions by solving large-scale complex optimization problems.()  AD OPT was the first company to use column generation technology to solve what is considered to be the most complex of optimization challenges:  Airline Scheduling.GENCOL is built around a shortest path with resource constraints algorithm. The column generator (or sub problem) shares information with the master problem. Together, with other optimization algorithms, such as the decomposition algorithm, these components drive optimization. AD OPTs master problem component is generic and allows the software to use different engines to produce the dual information needed by the generator. In many cases, Cplex engines are used, but also use heuristics.() Because column generation does not produce integer solutions, the scheme is embedded in a Branch and Cut/Bound framework. The framework defines an interface to branching methods that compete to make fractional solutions more integral. Each method evaluates what it can do on a given relaxed problem and the best one gets to modify the problem.() The role of the master problem is to find the optimal solution to the current restricted problem. The sub problems are used to verify if the master problem is optimal and to generate the variables that could potentially join the master problem.() Crew pairing Altitude PairingIn pairing, the goal of the optimizer is to increase productivity and minimize operational costs while maximizing operational efficiency. Its task is to pair flight legs that comply with all airline rules, contract agreements and government regulations into pairings deemed legal by these standards. A pairing is a block of one or several days of work, including periods of duty time and rest time.The solver takes into account the number of crews at each base, costs of hotels, per diem rates, deadheads and other business costs to optimize the pairing set.() Crew rosteringThe goal of crew rostering is to feasibly assign all the pairings planned during the planning period. All pairings must adhere to operational constraints as well as crew preferences to a certain degree, depending on the type of scheduling.Altitude PBS, Rostering and BLISS are different flavors of rostering systems.() Altitude PBSAltitude Bidding System (PBS) uses AD OPTs web based iBid crew interface to gather crew requests and optimize these with the solutions from Altitude Pairing. This approach is widely used in North American airlines. The bidding process accumulates a bidding score for each employee. The system then uses the optimizer to assign a schedule that yields the highest possible score to each employee. The optimizer also takes into account all pre-assigned activities, such as vacation or training periods, of the crewmembers.The system uses the following rules in solving the problem. Each employee schedule must:# be feasible, legal and conform with government rules and the collective agreement;# ensure that the set of residual pairings can feasibly be covered by junior crew members schedules;() Altitude RosteringThis method is very similar to PBS. It also uses the iBid interface to gather crew preferences. However, instead of attributing the highest score to the most senior crewmember, the optimizer aims for the highest global satisfaction score. It is based on a fair share, or equity model. This approach is widely used in European airlines. Altitude BLISSIn Altitude BLISS, or Bidline Integrated Scheduling System, the optimizer does not build schedules for each individual employee, but instead builds anonymous bidlines. Bidlines are monthly schedules that, again, satisfy all airline rules, contract agreements and government regulations.  The schedules are built and optimized following a set of recipes.  Recipes are a combination of instructions/preferences such as weekends off, regularity in day of week departure, pairing ID, time of day, length of pairings, etc.  Airlines will also tend to build recipes around what the crewmembers like.  This approach has been largely replaced by PBS as the latter takes the crew preferences into account before rostering starts. However it is still employed by some North American airlines.Once the bidlines are constructed, they are published to the crewmembers. The employees will then bid on the lines that they prefer. At the end of the bidding period, the optimizer will assign the lines according to seniority.() Manpower planning Altitude InsightAltitude Insight, formerly known as Altitude Manpower Planning (MPP), is a tool that enables airlines to plan crew requirements, months or years in advance. Airlines can also use the forecasting capabilities to run what-if scenarios to see the impact in crew hiring of potential aircraft purchases or the opening of a new destination or base.()Crewmembers can manage their career progression by bidding for open positions. Through the iBid Crew Interface, Altitude Insight also processes crewmembers equipment and promotional bids.  Altitude Insight also includes the Just In Time Training optimizer module. Just In Time Training plans out efficient crew training schedules so that airlines can manage which crewmembers need training for promotions or to new positions. Often, these promotions, which can result from new aircraft purchases, are accompanied by a salary increase as soon as training is complete. It is therefore not cost efficient to train employees as soon as the position is accepted. Altitude Insight takes into account the salary increases, all infrastructure costs, and the preplanned activities of all employees to be trained and constructs the training schedule that will be the most cost efficient and disrupt operations the least. Altitude VBSAltitude Vacation Biding System (VBS) integrates with AD OPTs other software to manage crew vacation time. VBS takes into account the vacation time of each employee, and their vacation requests taken from iBid to grant vacations. iBidThe iBid Crew Interface is a WEB application that enables crew members to input their scheduling requests from anywhere in the world. Using 2.0 technology, it has a multi-tab design and desktop application-like behavior so crewmembers can start using the Crew Interface with minimal prior training. In this interface, crew members enter their preferences and can view bid popularity.Bid popularity shows more junior employees what more senior employees are requesting the most. This enables them to get an idea of the likelihood of being granted the pairings or days off that they desire. This technology makes it easier for the crewmembers to bid more successfully. FRMSIn 2011, in order to support the introduction of FRMS (fatigue risk Management System) requirements as described in ICAO annex 6() and government laws such as the US HR 5900,() AD OPT entered a partnership with CIRCADIAN. CIRCADIAN provides 24/7 workforce performance and safety solutions for businesses that operate around the clock, through consulting expertise, research, and software tools, CIRCADIAN helps organizations reduce the inherent risks and costs of their extended hours of operations.()CIRCADIANs Alertness Simulator (CAS) conducts root analysis and investigation of fatigue. This enables the end-user to view the data on AD OPTs interface.() Airlines will be able to verify how crewmember alertness will be impacted by their flight schedules through AD OPTs planning interfaces.() ClientsSome of AD OPTs clients include:()* Air Canada* easyJet* Emirates Airlines* Etihad Airways* FedEx* Qantas Airways* South African Airlines* United Airlines* UPS* US Airways External links* AD OPT* Kronos Incorporated References

Ernest_of_Bavaria_(15001560)
 burial_place  FrauenkircheDuke Ernest of Bavaria (born: 13 June 1500 in Munich, died: 7 December 1560 in Glatz) was Administrator of the dioceses of Passau and Salzburg and pledge Lord of Glatz. Background and education Ernest was a member of the Bavarian noble Wittelsbach family. He was the third son of Duke Albert IV of Bavaria-Munich and his wife Kunigunde, daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III.In 1506 Albert issued a Primogeniture Act, stipulating that Bavaria should remain undivided. The result was that his two younger sons Louis and Ernest were excluded from the government.  Louiss parents decided that he should follow an eclessiastical career instead.  After Albert died in 1508, the Bavarian court historian Aventinus was entrusted with providing Ernest with a suitable education.   Ernest and Louis travelled to Italy, here he worked in Pavia and attended lectures from teh famous legal scholar Jason Magnus.  Ernest also travelled to Paris and to Saxony with of Malentein, who later became Bishop of Seckau.In 1515 Louis enrolled at the of Ingolstadt.  He soon became a member of Sodalitas Ingolstatiensis, a literary society founded by Aventinus, after a suggestion by the Humanist Celtis. Administrator of Passau With the support of Emperor Maximilian I the brothers William and Louis,succeeded in 1514 to have Ernest appointed Coadjutor of Bishop Frschl of Marzoll in Passau. The papal confirmation the appointment on 28 Januar 1517.Although Ernest had not been ordained, he was appointed Administrator of the Diocese of Passau after the death of Bishop Frschl in 1517.  Nevertheless, he did not give up his claim to the co-regency in the Duchy of Bavaria-Munich. His hereditary claims were supported by Archduke of Ferdinand I.  The issue was finally settled in 1534 by the Treaty of Linz between the royal houses of Habsburg and Wittelsbach.  In 1536, Ernest gave up his claims, in exchange for a severance payment of .As administrator of Passau, Ernest turned against the followers of Luther and against the Anabaptists.  In 1522, he participated in the Provincial Synod in am Inn and in 1527 he took part in the conference in Salzburg.  In 1524 he joined an alliance between the South German bishops, the dukes of Bavaria and the Archduke Ferdinand to enforce the of Worms.  On his instigation, the Reformer Kaiser was handed over to the secular authorties in 1527 and burned at the stake in Schrding, then part of the district of Burghausen.  In 1532, Ernest was present at the imperial Diet in Augsburg and in 1532 in Regensburg.As an entrepreneur, Ernest participated in Bohemian mines and traded in precious metals. He carried out transactions to Vienna, Prague, Leipzig and Antwerp, and maintained close relations with the South German trading cities. Administrator of Salzburg In accordance with the agreement from 1516, the brothers William and Louis sought to ensure that Ernest would be the next person to rule the Archdiocese of Salzburg.  In 1525, the made an agreement with the Salzburg chapter whereby Ernest was appointed coadjutor of the archbishop of Salzburg as compensation for the Bavarian help in the Peasants War.  The chapter duely proposed his appointment to the Pope, who rejected the proposal.  To enable a new appointment procedure, Ernest resigned from his position as administrator of the diocese of Passau.After the death of Bishop Lang von Wellenburg of Salzburg, Ernest was elected as administrator of Salzburg by the chapter on 21 April 1540.   The Pope confirmed his election on 21 May of that year, subject to the condition that within ten years, Ernest should be ordained as a priest or otherwise he would have to abandon the archdiocese. He took possession of the diocese on 12 October 1540.In Salzburg, like before in Passau, Ernest was lenient towards the Protestant movement.  Perhaps an understanding of the intellectual and social causes of the Reformation may have played a role. He contributed little to the intellectual and spiritual revival of Catholicism; he recognized, however, the social and economic developments of his time.  He attended the Diet of Regensburg in 1541 and held provincial synods in 1544 and 1553.  He was a capable admininstrator: he brought order to the countrys finances and introduced administrative reforms.  Like in Passau he loved economic enterprises. He was involved in Alpine mining, cattle and grain trade, and at dealing in coins.Even as Archbishop-designate Ernest delayed his ordination.  In his will, dated 25 September 1550, he explained that he had never intended to become a priest.  He repeatedly asked the Pope for dispensation of the higher orders, but this was finally denied in 1554.  The Pope presented him with the choice of being ordained immediately or resignation.  Ernest opted to resign and on 16 July 1554 he left to his successor, of Kuenburg. Pledge Lord of Glatz When the end of his ecclesiastical career loomed, Ernest purchased the of Glatz from III of Pernstein in 1549.  In 1549, Glatz was considered part of Bohemia.  Included in the purchase was the of Hummel, which Ernest gave to his son Eustace on 10 December 1549.  Eustace was his illegitimate son, until he was legitimized as a noble descendant of Ernest by Pope III in 1550.  In 1546, Ernest was accepted by the Estates of Bohemia as a landed subject.Ernest settled permanently in Glatz in 1556.  He did not resume hist former economic and business activities.  Although he no longer held an ecclesiastical office, he committed himself to the Reformation and in 1558, he and Emperor Ferdinand I, called a synod.  The primary aim of this synod was to test the beliefs of the clergy.  A questionnaire had been developed by the Cistercian abbots John of Grssau and Leonhard of Frstenfeld.Ernest also reformed the administration of Glatz, employing qualified officials, whom he had brought with him from Salzburg and Bavaria.  He expanded the castle of Glatz.  His purchase of Glatz included the privilege to mint coints, so he started minting coins showing the lion on one side and the coats of arms of Palatinate-Zweibrcken, the of Bavaria and the of Glatz on the other side.To round off his possessions, Ernest purchased in 1556 the East Bohemian Lordships of nad Knnou, Castle, Pottejn,(Ondej Felcman: esk koutek v Kladskm Hrabstv - Jeho esk koeny a nsledn vztahy k eskmu sousedstv, in: esk koutek v Kladsku. Kladsk sbornk, supplement 5, Hradec Krlov, 2008, ISBN 978-80-903509-8-4, p. 28, remark 13) Solnice and ernkovice.Ernest died in 1560 and was buried in Glatz.  A short time later, however, his body was transferred to Munich and buried in the Wittelsbach crypt in the Church of Our Lady.  The pledge lordship of Glatz was inherited by his nephew Albert V, who sold it to Maximilian II in 1567.

William_Snell_Chauncy
William Snell Chauncy (11 August 18203 July 1878)(CHAUNCY, William Snell b: 11 AUG 1820 in Addlestone, Chertsey, Surrey, England d: 3 JUL 1878 in Goulburn, New South Wales, Australia) was an English civil engineer responsible for a number of important engineering works including the first steam railway  opened in Australia.Early life and workWilliam Snell Chauncy was born in Addlestone, Chertsey, Surrey, England in 1820. He married Anna Cox at St Michael & All Angels church, Berkshire on 7 July 1840. Chauncy initially worked with architect and surveyor, William Mullinger Higgins, on the design of a new grandstand for Ascot Race Course.(Margaret Hardwick Hardwick Genealogy)In 1840 Chauncy and Anna migrated to Australia on the ship the  Appoline  arriving on 22 November in Adelaide where they had family, including a half-brother Philip who as assistant surveyor of Western Australia, may have been in a position to recommend Chauncy for engineering work.(The Australian venture was short lived and Chauncy set off back to England in 1844 via South Africa, but the birth of their second child Sophia Mary on board ship, caused him to delay at the Cape of Good Hope, where he obtained work supervising the construction of 300 miles of roads and several bridges. By 1846 he had moved to Ireland and was assistant engineer of roads in Mayo. The family, however, stayed in West London.  In about 1848, William was appointed assistant engineer on the London to Dover Railway, under Cubitt.(Return to AustraliaIn 1849 William wrote a pamphlet for prospective emigrants to Australia, evidently based on his personal experience.(A guide to South Australia, being a descriptive account of the colony addressed to intending emigrants, and containing the latest authentic information. London, E. Rich, 1849. by William Snell Chauncy, nearly four years resident in that province. SOUTH AUSTRALIAN FACSIMILE EDITIONS  No. 47 Public Library of South Australia Adelaide 1962)  Possibly connected to this was his return to Adelaide on the of Wellington in the same year.(Wednesday November 7th, 1849: the ship Duke of Wellington, 560 tons, Miller, Master, from London and Plymouth. Passengers: W.S. Chauncey Esq., Civil Engineer, lady & four children) The South Australian Railway Committee had commissioned W.S. Chauncy to report on a possible railway line from from Adelaide, north to the copper mining town of Burra, but by the time he had completed about 84 miles of the survey, a more effective route through Port Wakefield had supplanted the northern line.(South Australian gazette and colonial register (30 August 1850, p. 4)) However, he completed surveying the Adelaide to Port Adelaide Railway line and in 1851 surveyed a road for the Central Board of Main Roads from South Australia to Wellington Ferry on the River, which although officially named the South Eastern Road,  is generally known as Chauncys Line.((Place Names of South Australia)First Australian railwayIn about 1851 he moved to Victoria where a rush boom had created new opportunities and by 1853 the family was residing at Sandridge near Melbourne. William was appointed as chief engineer of the Hobsons Bay Railway company in Melbourne, Australia preparing designs and supervising contracts for the first steam railway to operate in Australia in 1854. However, he resigned the engineership of the line under a cloud as the work he had carried out on the railway pier had proven useless. He was replaced by James Moore.()Chauncy also gave evidence to the select committee inquiring on the railway gauge in 1853 (Votes and proceedings of the Legislative Council during the ..., Volume 3 By Victoria. Parliament. Legislative Council) and the inquiry into roads and railways in 1854.(Victoria: Internal Communication. Report of the Commissioners Appointed to Enquire into the Best Mode of Providing for the Internal Communication of the Colony. 1854)Around this time Chauncy also wrote another pamphlet How to Settle in Victoria using the pen name Rusticus.(Chauncy, W. Snell How to settle in Victoria : or, Instructions on the purchase and occupation of the land, with observations on gardening and farming : the growth of the vine and other fruit trees ; the nature and quality of the Australian soils and on the use of manures ; to which is added a rural calendar, description of the climate, and other useful information. Slater, Williams and Hodgson, Melbourne, 1855.)Move to New South WalesIn 1856 William took up a position as district surveyor in Belvoir in north east Victoria (Belvoir was later changed to Wodonga). His work appears to have involved crown land surveys, including Belvoir itself,(Part of the Township of Belvoir with suburban lands adjoining Murray District W. S. Chauncy, Assis.t Survy.r, April 1st 1868; Public Lands Office, Melbourne, May 18th 1858 W. Collis, Lithographer Victoria.

Chauncey, Asst Surveyor, May 3rd 59 ; lithographed at the Crown Lands Office, Melbourne, 29 August 1859) In 1861 he supervised  the erection of the first road bridge over the River between Wodonga and New South Wales. His sixteen year old daughter, Sophia had the honour of cutting the ribbon at the opening ceremony.(In 1868 Chauncy was appointed  road superintendent at New South Wales with one of his responsibilities being improvements to the main Sydney to Melbourne Road (now the Hume Highway).  He died in 1878 of gastric fever. Chauncy had  evidently been very popular with his fellow officers, contractors and workman who erected a befitting monument to his honour at Goulburn Cemetery.(References*Memoirs of Mrs. Poole and Mrs. Chauncy, Philip Lamothe Snell Chauncy

History_of_rail_transport_in_Angola
:This article is part of the of rail transport by country seriesFile:Contrato Williams.JPG|thumb|Caricature by Herminio showing the Scottish mining engineer Robert Williams, a contract in his pocket, giving Portugal a railway line in Lobito.The history of rail transport in Angola began during the nineteenth century, when Angola was a colony of Portugal.  It has involved the construction, operation and destruction of four separate, unconnected, coast-to-inland systems, in two different gauges.  Operations on three of those systems have been largely restored; the other system has been closed.BeginningsPlans to develop Angola by constructing railway lines existed from 1887.  Two years later, the Railway () (LuandaVianaLucala) was built and opened in the north of the colony, at the initiative of a private railway company.  By 1909, that line had been extended eastwards to Malanje as a state railway.  Later, a branch line was built from Zenza do Hombe to Dondo.The second significant line, the Railway (Portugese: Linha de Momedes) (later the Namibe Railway) (Portugese: Caminho-de-ferro do Namibe), was built as a state railway, in  gauge.  The Momedes Railway connected the port city of Momedes (now Namibe), in the south of the colony, with the inland town of Menongue. In 1910, part of this line was opened.  Other sections were later opened to Dongo and Cassinga before the entire line was completed.Benguela RailwayThe Railway (Portugese: Caminho de Ferro de Benguela) was completed in 1912, to link the two port cities of Lobito and Benguela with Huambo. This line, in central Angola, included an approximately  long railway portion, with gradients of up to six percent.By 1929, the line had been extended to Dilolo, now in the Republic of the Congo, to enable the copper deposits in the Congolese province of Katanga to be transported to the Atlantic ports. Together with other railway lines, this extended line yielded an almost continuous railway route to es Salaam, in what was then Tanganyika. Only two sections on the  route were required to be negotiated by ship.  Later, it was possible to reach the Mozambican port of Beira by rail.The Benguela Railway proved to be most important railway line in Angola.Other colonial linesA fourth railway line to connect the Angolan inland with a port was built later, in  gauge, and linked Amboim with Gabela. Porto Amboim is on the coast between Luanda and Lobito. The Porto AmboimGabela line was managed by the Luanda Railway.Additionally, some branch lines were built, such as a  gauge railway from Lubango, on the Moamedes Railway, to Chiange.  This branch line made Lubango one of Angolas few rail junctions.Another colonial development was the regauging of the Moamedes Railway in the 1950s, from  gauge to gauge ().Post independenceOn 11 November 1975, Angola became independent. By then, the civil war had already begun.  The civil war lasted until 2002, and brought rail traffic in Angola almost to a standstill. As early as 1975, the Benguela Railway was no longer functional. Several lines, such as the Porto AmboimGabela line, were later closed down permanently.In 2005, passenger traffic resumed on the LobitoCubal section of the Benguela Railway, and freight traffic was reinstated between Lobito and Huambo.  In 2007, commuter traffic began operating once again in Huambo.See also*of Angola*transport in AngolaReferences*External linksin Angola#Geschichte

History_of_radiation_therapy
The history of radiation therapy or radiotherapy can be traced back to experiments made soon after the discovery of x-rays (1895), when it was shown that exposure to radiation produced cutaneous burns. Influenced by electrotherapy and escharotics  the medical application of caustic substances  doctors began using radiation to treat growths and lesions produced by diseases such as lupus, ulcer, and epithelioma.( Radiation was generally believed to have bactericidal properties, so when radium was discovered, in addition to treatments similar to those used with x-rays, it was also used as an additive to medical treatments for diseases such as tuberculosis where there were resistant bacilli.(( Additionally, because radiation was found to exist in hot spring waters which were reputed for their curative powers, it was marketed as a wonder cure for all sorts of ailments in medicine and quack cures. It was believed by medical science that small doses of radiation would cause no harm and the harmful effects of large doses were temporary.(The widespread use of radium in medicine ended when it was discovered that physical tolerance was lower than expected and exposure caused long term cell damage that could appear in carcinoma up to 40 years after treatment.( The use of radiation continues today as a treatment for cancer in therapy, where it is applied with strict safety precautions.Early development of radiotherapy (18951905)When the imaging properties of x-rays were discovered, their practical use for research and diagnostics was immediately apparent, and soon their use spread in the medical field. X-rays were used to diagnose bone fractures, heart disease, and pthisis. Inventive procedures for different diagnostic purposes were created, such as filling digestive cavities with bismuth, which allowed them to be seen through tissue and bone.(Discovery of the therapeutic potential of radiationDuring early practical work and scientific investigation, experimenters noticed that prolonged exposure to x-rays created inflammation and, more rarely, tissue damage on the skin. The biological effect attracted the interest of Lopold Freund and Schiff, who, only a month or two after Rntgens announcement, suggested they be used in the treatment of disease.( At approximately the same time, Grubbe began experimenting in Chicago with medical uses of x-rays.( Escharotics by this time had already been used to treat skin malignancies through caustic burns, and electrotherapy had also been experimented with, in the aim to stimulate the skin tissue.The first attempted x-ray treatment was by Despeignes, a French physician who used them on a patient with stomach cancer. In 1896, he published a paper with the results: a week-long treatment was followed by a diminution of pain and reduction in the size of the tumor, though the case was ultimately fatal. The results were inconclusive, because the patient was concurrently being given other treatments.( Freunds first experiment was a tragic failure; he applied x-rays to a naevus in order to induce epilation and a deep ulcer resulted, which resisted further treatment by radiation. The first successful treatment was by Schiff, working with Freund, in a case of vulgaris.  A year later, in 1897, the two published a report of their success and this provoked further experimentation in x-ray therapies.( Thereafter they did a successful treatment of erythematosus in 1898. The lesion took a common form of a butterfly-patch which appeared on both sides of the face, and Schiff applied the irradiation to one side only, in order to compare the effects.(Within a few months, scientific journals were swamped with accounts of the successful treatment of different types of skin tissue malignancies with x-rays. In Sweden, Stenbeck published results of the first successful treatments of ulcer and epithelioma in 1899, later that year confirmed by Sjgren.( Soon afterwards, their findings were confirmed by a number of other physicians.(The nature of the active agent in therapeutic treatment was still unknown, and subject to wide dispute. Freund and Schiff believed it to because of electrical discharge, Tesla argued they were because of the ozone generated by the x-rays, while others argued that it was the x-rays themselves. Teslas position was soon refuted, and only the other two theories remained. In 1900, Kienbck produced a study based on a series of experiments that demonstrated that it was the x-rays themselves. Studies published in 1899 and 1900 suggested that the rays varied in penetration due to according to the degree of vacuum in the tube.(Niels Finsen and phototherapythumb|350px|right|The Finsen hospital lamp, 1900. The projecting tubes can be adjusted so as to permit the focusing of the light, which is directed through a hollow lens thats kept pressed down upon the part under treatment. The nurses and patients are wearing dark glasses to protect the eyes from the light.Finsen, a Faroese-Danish physician, had by that time already pursued interest in the biological effects of light. He published a paper, Om Lysets Indvirkninger paa Huden (On the effects of light on the skin) in 1893. Inspired by the discovery that x-rays could have therapeutic effects, he extended his research to examine directed light rays. In 1896, he published a paper on his findings, Om Anvendelse i Medicinen af koncentrerede kemiske Lysstraaler (The use of concentrated chemical light rays in medicine). Finsen discovered that lupus was amenable to treatment by ultraviolet rays when separated out by a system of quartz crystals, and thereafter created a lamp to sift out the rays. The so-called lamp became widely used in for phototherapy, and derivatives of it became used when experimenting with other types of radiotherapy.( Modifications were made to Finsens original design, and it found its most common forms in the lamp and lamp .By 1905, it was estimated that fully 50 percent of the cases of lupus were successfully healed by Finsens methods.( Fisen was soon awarded a Nobel prize for his research.Rntgenotherapythumb|325px|left|X-ray apparatus used for treatment of epithelioma of the face, 1915. The tube is in a localizing shield; and a perforated sheet of metal is securely fashioned to the surface by adhesive plaster.(From initial therapeutic experiments, a new field of x-ray therapy was born, referred to as rntgenotherapy after Rntgen, the discoverer of x-rays. It was still unclear how the x-rays acted on the skin; however, it was generally agreed upon that the area affected was killed and either discharged or absorbed.(By 1900, there were four well established classes of problems that were treated by x-ray, based on a set of five classes initially outlined by Freund: 1. in hypertrichosis, for the removal of unwanted hair; 2. in the treatment of disease of hair and hair follicles in which it was necessary to remove hair; 3. in the treatment of inflammatory affections on the skin like eczema and acne; 4. and in the treatment of malignant affections on the skin in cases like lupus and epithelioma.((Additionally, x-rays were successfully applied to other appearances of carcinoma, trials were done in treating leukemia, and because of the supposed bactericidal properties, there were suggestions it could be used in diseases such as tuberculosis. Experiments were also done using x-rays to treat epilepsy, which had previously also experimentally been treated with electrical currents.(Further development and the use of radium (19051915)Because of the excitement over the new treatment, literature about the therapeutic effects of x-rays often exaggerated the propensity to cure different diseases. Reports of the fact that in some cases treatment worsened some of the patients conditions were ignored in favor of hopeful optimism. G. Piffard referred to these practitioners as radiomaniacs and radiografters. It was found that x-rays were only capable of producing a cure in certain cases of the basal cell type of epithelioma and exceedingly unreliable in malignant cancer, not making it a suitable replacement for surgery. In many cases of treatment, the cancer recurred after a period of time. X-ray experiments in pulmonary tuberculosis proved useless. Aside from the medical profession losing faith in the ability of x-ray therapy, the public increasingly viewed it as a dangerous type of treatment. This resulted in a period of pessimism about the use of x-rays, which lasted from about 1905 to 1910 or 1912.(Radium therapy thumb|275px|right|Small tubes containing radium salts are strapped to an womans face to treat what was either lupus or rodent ulcer, 1905.(Soon after the discovery of radium in 1898 by Curie, there was speculation in whether the radiation could be used for therapy in the same way as that from x-rays. The physiological effect of radium was first observed in 1900 by Walkhoff,( and later confirmed by what famously known as the Becquerel burn. In 1901, Becquerel had placed a tube of radium in a waistcoat pocket where it had remained for several hours; a week or two after which there was severe inflammation of his skin underneath where the radium had been kept. Besnier, a dermatologist, examined the skin and expressed the opinion that it was due to the radium, leading to experiments by Curie which confirmed it. Besnier suggested the use of radium for therapy along the same purposes as x-rays and ultraviolet rays.Becquerel for this purpose loaned some radium to Danlos of the hpital St.Louis in Paris in 1901.( Danlos successfully treated a few cases of lupus with an admixture of radium and chloride. Further trials of radium therapy began, though at a much slower pace than did those using x-rays because radium was expensive and difficult to obtain.Methods of applicationthumb|250px|left|Glass applicators for radium emanation, 1918.(thumb|200px|right|Illustration showing a tube for applying radium salts, 1918.(Radium was soon seen as a way to treat disorders that were not affected enough by x-ray treatment because it could be applied in a multitude of ways in which x-rays could not.( Different methods of applying radium had been tested, which fell into two categories: the use of radium emanation (now referred to as radon), and the use of radium salts.One method using emanation was through inhalation, where it was mixed with air. Radium inhalation had been most studied in Germany, where regular inhalation institutes were established, and the goal was to target the lungs. That was done either to treat lung diseases, like tuberculosis, or to be absorbed through the surface of the lung to the blood, where it could circulate through the body. It was claimed that the beneficial effects produced by radium water baths were the result of inhalation of the vapors.(Another method of treatment was to condense the emanation at liquid air temperature on substances such as vasoline, glycerine, and lanoline, to apply externally to the part affected; or on quinine, bismuth, subnitrate, and arsenic, to be consumed or applied internally.( Radium emanation was also passed into glass or metal tubes or flat glass-tight applicators and applied in the same way as radium tubes. In other cases was also deposited on metal points or flat surfaces of metal using electrical devices, which had the same level of radioactivity as the parent radium, but lasted a shorter duration. One way of treatment was to then drive the deposits of radioactive material into tissue using galvanic current. It was also a method of applying radium emanation to a specially designed applicator constructed to suit the needs of the patient, who could later take it home.(Dilute solutions of radium salts were also made, meant to be used internally. Patients would be prescribed regular dosages. More rarely, the salts were also suspended in liquids to be injected in subcutaneous treatments, which could be applied locally to affected tissues. That was considered the most expensive method, because the radium used was irreparably lost.( Like with radium emanation, solutions of free radium salts were also placed in tubes; in this case, the tubes were made from platinum. In metal tubes, the radium could be employed in a number of ways: externally; to the interior of the body in places like the mouth, nose, esophagus, rectum and vagina; and into the substance of a tumor through incisions.(Radium bathsIn 1903, the discoverer of the electron, Thompson, wrote a letter to the journal Nature in which he detailed his discovery of the presence of radioactivity in well water. Soon after, others found that the waters in many of the worlds most famous health springs were also radioactive. This radioactivity is due to the presence of radium emanation produced by the radium that is present in the ground through which the waters flow. In 1904, Nature published a study on the natural radioactivity of different mineral waters.( Inspired by this, using preparations of radium salt in bath water was suggested as a way for patients to be treated at home, as the radio-activity in the bathwater was permanent.( Radium baths became used experimentally to treat arthritis, gout, and neuralgias.Rntgenotherapy vs. radium therapyX-rays and radium were noted by physicians to have different advantages in different cases. The most marked effects produced with radium therapy were with lupus, ulcerous growths, and keloid, particularly because they could be applied more specifically to tissues than with x-rays.( Radium was generally to be preferred when a localized reaction was desired, while for x-rays when a large area needed to be treated.( Radium was also believed to be bactericidal, while x-rays were not. Because they could not be applied locally, x-rays were also found to have worse cosmetic effects than radium when treating malignancies. In certain cases, a combination of x-ray and radium therapy was suggested. In many skin diseases, the ulcers would be treated with radium and the surrounding areas with x-rays so it would positively affect the lymphatic systems.(Tuberculosis and iodo-radium therapyAfter using radium in the surgicial treatment of tuberculosis, researchers including Augustin and de Szendeffy soon developed a treatment using radioactive metholated iodine, which was patented under the name dioradin (formed from iodine and radium) in 1911. Application of this treatment was referred to as iodo-radium therapy, and involved injecting dioradin intramuscularly. It seemed promising to the developers, because in several cases, fever and hemoptysis had disappeared.( Inhalation of iodine alone had been an experimental treatment for tuberculosis in France between 1830 and 1870.(Commercialization, quackery, and the end of an era (19151935)thumb|275px|left|Advertisement for a scientifically developed radiation emanation activator.( This particular device is suggested for use by Augustus Call in a textbook on post-graduate medicine.(Widespread commercial exploitation of radium only began in 1913, by which time more efficient methods of extracting radium from pitchblende had been discovered(( and the mining of radium had taken off.(Commercial productsthumb|200px|right|Advertisement for Revigator from the 1930s.Image:Tho-Radia-IMG 1228.JPG|thumb|200px|Tho-radia powder, based on radium and thorium, according to the formula of Dr Alfred CurieRadium had commonly been put into bath salts, waters, and muds was in low-grade preparations, due to the expense, and their usefulness in curative solutions was questioned, since it had been agreed upon by physicians that radium could only be used successfully in high doses.( It was believed that even radiation emanation at higher doses that were useful would cause no harm, because the radioactive deposits were found to have been absorbed and released in urine and waste within a period of three hours.(Radiation emanation activatorsRadium emanation activators, apparatuses that would apply radium emanation to water, started being produced and marketed. Scientifically constructed emanators were sold to hospitals, universities, and independent researchers. Certain companies advertised that they would only give them out to others on a medical prescription( and would guarantee the strength of radium in each dose. Many products which imitated emanation activators were more broadly marketed to the public. One such product was the Revigator, a radioactive water crock.  A dispensing jar made of radium-containing ore, the idea was that radon produced by the ore would dissolve in the water overnight. It was advertised:  Fill jar every night. Drink freely . . . when thirsty and upon arising and retiring, average six or more glasses daily.  The Medical Association (AMA) was concerned that the public was being fleeced by charlatans. In response, the AMA established guidelines (in effect from 1916 to 1929) that emanators seeking AMA approval had to generate more than 2 Ci (74 kBq) of radon per liter of water in a 24-hour period. Most devices on the market, including the Revigator did not meet that standard.(Patent medicinesMany other quack cures and medicines were sold on the market. Radithor, a solution of radium salts, which was claimed by its developer J. A. Bailey to have curative properties. Many brands of toothpaste were laced with radium that was claimed to make teeth shine whiter, such as Radioactive Toothpaste. Ostensibly, this would be because the radium would kill the bacteria in a persons mouth. One item, called Degnens Radio-Active Eye Applicator manufactured by the Radium Appliance Company of Los Angeles, California, was sold as a treatment for myopia, hypermetropia, presbyopia and heterophobia. Face creams and powders were sold, with names like Revigorette and Tho-radia. It was also sold as a supplement to smoking cigarettes. Companies also marked radioactive pads and compresses for the treatment of illnesses.(Joachimsthal radium spa hotelIn light of the supposed curative properties of radioactivity, a spa was opened up in Joachimsthal, the place at which Madame Curie gathered some of her original samples of radium from spring waters. Radon inhalation rooms were set up, where air tubes carried the gas up from a processing tank in the basement; the visitor would then use it through an inhalation apparatus. Baths were set up which were also irradiated, and irradiated air was also filtered through a trumpet like pipe for inhalation.(Public health concernsConcerns about radium were brought up before the States Senate by California Senator D. Works as early as 1915. In a floor speech he quoted letters from doctors asking about the efficacy of the products that were marketed. He stressed that radiation had the effect of making many cancers worse, many doctors thought the belief radium could be used to cure cancers at that stage of the development of therapy was a delusion  one doctor quoted cited a failure-to-success rate of 100 to 1  and the effects of radium water was undemonstrated.(Around the start of the 1920s, new public health concerns were sparked by the deaths of factory workers at a radioluminsecent watch factory, later referred to as the Girls. In 1932, a well-known industrialist, Byers died of radiation poisoning from the use of Radithor, a radium water guaranteed by the manufacturer to contain 2 Ci of radium.( Cases sprung up of the development of carcinoma in patients who had used conventional radium therapy up to 40 years after the original treatments.(Robley D. Evans made the first measurements of exhaled radon and radium excretion from a former dial painter in 1933. At MIT he gathered dependable body content measurements from 27 dial painters. This information was used in 1941 by the Bureau of Standards to establish the level for radium of 0.1 Ci (3.7 kBq).Coutard methodAt the International Congress of Oncology in Paris in 1922, Coutard, a French radiologist working with the Curie, presented evidence that laryngeal cancer could be treated without disastrous side-effects. Coutard was inspired by the observations of Regaud, who found that a single dose of x-rays sufficient enough to produce severe skin damage and tissue destruction in a rabbit, if administered in fractions, over a course of days, would sterilize the rabbit but have no effect on subcutaneous tissues.(By 1934, Coutard had developed a protracted, fractionated process that remains the basis for current radiation therapy.( Coutards dosage and fractionation were designed to create a severe but recoverable acute mucosal reaction. Unlike previous physicians, who believed that cancerous cells were more effected by radiation, he assumed that the population of cancerous cells had the same sensitivity for regeneration as normal cells.( Coutard reported a 23% cure rate in the treatment of head and neck cancer.( In 1935, hospitals everywhere began following his treatment plan.(Radiation therapy today (1935)thumb|350px|left|Axesse Radiation therapyTreatments of cancer by x-ray today generally follows Coutards fractionated process, while radiated rods are used in brachytherapy.The three main divisions of radiation therapy are beam radiation therapy or teletherapy, brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy, and systemic radioisotope therapy or unsealed source radiotherapy. The differences relate to the position of the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources. The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or applicator is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the applicator after the applicator is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel. therapy is a special case of external beam radiation therapy where the particles are protons or heavier ions. Intraoperative radiation therapy or IORT is a special type of radiation therapy that is delivered immediately after surgical removal of the cancer. This method has been employed in breast cancer (TARGeted Introperative radiation therapy or TARGIT), brain tumors and rectal cancers.Radioactive idiodine, as developed in 1911, survives today primarily in the treatment of thyrotoxicosis (hyperthyroidism) and some types of thyroid cancer that absorb iodine. Treatment involves iodine-131 (131I), or radioiodone, an important radioisotope of iodine.Notesrefs()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()References* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  (jstor stable link)

Neolithic_flint_mines_of_Spiennes
map_caption  Location in BelgiumThe Neolithic flint mines of Spiennes are Europes largest and earliest neolithic mines, located close to Walloon village of Spiennes, southeast of  Mons, Belgium. The mines were active during the mid and late Neolithic (4400-3000 BC). The site and its surroundings were added to the UNESCOs list of World Heritage Sites in 2000.DescriptionIt is well known for its  flint mines,() which are on the list of UNESCO Heritage Sites since 2000. The entry on the list describes them as the largest and earliest concentration of ancient mines in Europe and cites the level of human technological development they demonstrate as justification for their inclusion.()The mines cover some 100 hectares of downland near Mons in Belgium and are interesting for showing the transition between opencast and underground mining for the flint nodules. The nodules were extracted using deer antler picks. The stones were then knapped into rough-out shapes of axes, and finally polished to achieve the final state.The rough-outs were traded over a wide area, and were often polished at their destination. Polishing strengthens the final product, making the axe-head last longer. The axes were used initially for forest clearance during the early Neolithic period, and for shaping wood for structural applications, such as timber for huts and canoes.Other sitesThe site is comparable with Graves and Cissbury in the Kingdom, which were also sources of flint. Other hard rocks were used for making polished axes however. There are many locations in Britain where fine-grained igneous or metamorphic rocks were collected from screes or mined opencast, then roughed out locally before trading on to other parts of the country. Examples include the axe industry, Penmaenmawr and Tievebulliagh.See also* Cissbury* Flint* Graves* axe* CultureReferences;Citations;Bibliography* C. Guillaume, Ph. Lipinski & A.

Ruby_Murders
The Ruby Murders is the popular name for three separate incidents involving the deaths of six American citizens at or near the town of Ruby, Arizona. The first incident occurred in February 1920 when Mexican bandits, described at the time as Villistas, robbed and killed the two owners of the Ruby Mercantile. A second attack happened fourteen months later in April 1921 when again, Mexican outlaws killed the stores owners and robbed the place. Two of the bandits were arrested for the crime but they briefly escaped custody in July 1922, after killing another two men, which led to the largest manhunt in the history of the Southwest.(Sherman)(http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-ruby.html)MurdersThe town of Ruby was established in Valley during the 1870s and was a haven for rustlers and other criminals for most of its Old West history. A typical town of the era, Ruby was very small and its one store was the sole business other than mining. The store, called the Ruby Mercantile, was built sometime in the late 1880s and was also the office when it opened in 1912. In 1914 the mercantile was purchased by Philip C. Clarke who later built a larger store a short distance from the original. This second building was an adobe structure, the remains of which have been preserved. Clarke felt the town was so dangerous that he kept either a pistol or a rifle in each room of his house and the store. Due to the outbreak of the Revolution in 1910, and the towns close proximity to the international border, Ruby was harassed by bandits and rebels on many occasions. Rebels loyal to Villa, a famed border bandit and revolutionary, were active throughout the Mexican territory opposite of the Arizona border. The area was one of the hardest hit during the civil war which fueled the lawlessness. By 1920 the town was declining and still considered quite dangerous, the inhabitants were instructed to be heavily armed at all times.(http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-ruby.html) Finally in January 1920 Clarke sold the mercantile to John and Alexander Frazer before moving his family to the nearby settlement of Oro Blanco. Less than two months after the Clarke family left, on February 27, 1920, the Frazer brothers were found dead in the store. Alexander was found lying on the floor near the register. He had been shot twice, one bullet wound was found in Alexanders head and the second in his back. John was found nearby, he was still alive but unconscious, having been hit in the left eye by one bullet. He died though five hours later without regaining consciousness. An investigation by police found that the bandits had robbed the place and cut the wires for the towns only telephone, which was located in the store. The police discovered two sets of footprints around the store and also learned from the townspeople that two unknown Mexicans had been seen in the area. A local rancher reported that two of his best horses and eight of his cattle had been stolen at or near the same date, making the police assume the incidents were related.  The Nogales newspaper Weekly Oasis  said the tragedy is nothing new over there. In the wild and rugged region south from the Mountains and the Bear Valley region, there has been always a harbor for a bunch of desperate characters, whose depredations have been felt by American cattlemen and ranchers through many years.(http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-ruby.html)A posse was sent south along the bandits trail but they failed to catch up with the suspects, several men were later arrested for the crime but ultimately none of them were charged and the outlaws went unpunished. The second incident occurred in April 1921 following the transfer of the mercantiles ownership to a Mr. and Mrs. Frank Pearson, who lived in the store itself, with their three daughters. Mr. Pearson was warned of the previous killings, and the situation of the Mexican bandits, though he felt that a second attack on the store was unlikely to happen. However, on the morning of April 26, Frank and his wife Myrtle took a horseback ride into the surrounding hills and while doing so they spotted a group of seven Mexicans riding towards the town. The two thought that the Mexicans would likely want to visit the mercantile so they rode back to Ruby to service them. When the bandits entered the store they asked for tobacco and as soon as Mr. Pearson turned around to get it, the Mexicans drew their pistols and fired into the mans back. Pearson was mortally wounded by two bullets but he grabbed his pistol under the counter and fired three shots wildly before dying.(http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-ruby2.html) After that the murderers turned their attention to Myrtle who had five gold teeth. First one bandit shot Myrtle in the neck to stop her from screaming and then he knocked out her gold teeth with a pistol butt. She was then shot a second time in the head and killed. Franks daughter Elizabeth was also grazed in the arm but other than that the three young girls were left unharmed. The Mexicans ended the affair after they emptied the safe and destroyed the telephone, for a second time. They then rode out of town yelling and firing their guns in the air. When the Mexicans were gone the Pearson girls fled eight miles away to the nearest neighbor. This time when authorities were called for and ambulance was sent from Nogales which treated Elizabeths wounds. Meanwhile, a large posse of citizens and lawmen began searching the surrounding desert. A States Army biplane, from the garrison at Nogales, was also dispatched to participate in the search and it became the first aircraft to be used for a manhunt in the history of Arizona. A $5,000 bounty, dead or alive, was also placed for each of the seven Mexicans, partly due to the fact that the gang was suspected of being responsible for the first robbery. A few months later, authorities heard rumors that two men in a Sonora cantina had bragged about being responsible for robbing the Ruby Mercantile.(http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-ruby2.html) American police investigated the claim but it wasnt until April 1922 that any arrests were made. By chance an Arizona sheriff, at a cantina in Sasabe, Mexico, overheard the conversation between the bartender and a customer. The bartender was trying to sell five gold teeth he had acquired sometime earlier by an outlaw named Manuel Martinez. When the deputy saw the teeth, he was sure they belonged to Myrtle so he bought them and took them back to the United States. Martinez was known for associating with a Mexican named Placidio Silvas, who lived near Oro Blanco. The two were eventually arrested without incident and put on trial for murder in May 1922, both were found guilty of murder by the court of Santa Cruz County. Martinez was sentenced to be hung and Silvas received a sentence of life in the state prison at Florence but on July 13, while the two prisoners were being transported in a police car, they managed to break free from their handcuffs, with a file, and then bludgeoned Sheriff George White and Deputy L. A. Smith with a wrench. The police car was found later that day, rolled into a ditch near Continental with the bodies of White and Smith nearby. White was killed but Smith was still alive and taken to a hospital where he died of his wounds.(http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-ruby3.html)The men who found White and Smith trailed the outlaws across the Rita Mountains but they lost track of them near Ruby due to the monsoon. The Arizona public was shocked about this latest double homicide so over 700 volunteers, from the Pima, Pinal, Cochise and Santa Cruz counties formed posses for the largest manhunt in the history of the Southwest. Initially the Martinez and Silvas evaded the search parties but six days after escape search dogs uncovered a blood stained file which put authorities back on the bandits trail. That same day Martinez and Silvas were found hiding under some brush in the Tumacacori Mountains, about seventy miles from the site where the two had escaped custody. The two Mexicans were re-tried in court and found guilty again but the Mexican Consul appealed the courts decision and obtained a writ, which delayed the case, but finally the Supreme Court intervened and the matter was settled. Martinez was sentenced to death and executed by hanging on August 10, 1923. Silvas was put into prison at Florence and he later escaped in 1928, never to be seen again.(http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-ruby3.html)See also*Massacres*Colorado, Arizona*War (1910-1918)References*

George_Gund_(philanthropist)
 children  George III, Agnes, Gordon, Graham, Geoffrey, LouiseGeorge Gund II (April 13, 1888  November 15, 1966) was an American banker, business executive, and real estate investor who lived in Ohio in the early and middle part of the 20th century.  A philanthropist for most of his life, he established George Gund Foundation in 1952 and endowed it with most of his $600 million fortune at his death.Early lifeGunds grandfather, Johann Gund, was born in 1830 in Brhl am Rhein in the independent country of the Duchy of Baden (now part of Germany).(Haller, p. 216.) The family emigrated to the United States in 1848 and settled in Illinois, but in 1854 moved to Crosse, Wisconsin.( There his grandfather founded the John Gund Brewery.( His father, George Frederick Gund, was born in LaCrosse in 1856 and later managed the Gund Brewery.( His father moved to Seattle, Washington, founded the Seattle Brewing and Malting Company, became a director of two banks, and then returned to the Midwest to move his family to Cleveland in 1897.(Musson, p. 34.) His father bought the Jacob Mall Brewing Company, renamed it the Gund Brewing Company, and made a large fortune investing in banking, mining, and real estate.(George Gund, Jr. (as he was then known) was born to George Frederick and Anna Louise (Metzger) Gund( on April 13, 1888.(Committee on the History of the Federal Reserve System. Biographical Master File. Papers from the Committee on the History of the Federal Reserve System. United States Federal Reserve System. 1954. Accessed 2011-08-04.) He was a student at the University School of Cleveland from 1897 to 1905.( He entered University, and received his A.B. in 1909.( Toward the end of his Harvard education, he simultaneously enrolled in the Business School, and graduated in the schools first class in 1909.(Haller, p. 58.)  He moved to Seattle and took a job as a clerk with the Seattle First National Bank, but moved back to Cleveland when his father died in 1916.(Van Tassel and Grabowski, p. 445.) But when World War I broke out, he enlisted in the States Army and served in the Intelligence Division.(Foundation Reporter, p. 446.)Business career and deathAfter the start of in the United States in 1920, Gund was forced to close his fathers brewery in Cleveland.( But during the war, Kaffee HAG, a German corporation, was stripped of its assets in the United States. Among its subsidiaries was Sanka, the company which manufactured decaffeinated coffee.  Gund purchased Sanka in 1919, then sold it to Kellogs in 1927 for $10 million in stock.(Davis, p. 277; Musson, p. 59.) Gund also took over management of the Gund Realty Company in Cleveland and invested his money in numerous ventures.( During the depths of the Great Depression, he purchased large amounts of stock at very low prices.(George Gund, 78, Banks Chairman. New York Times. November 16, 1966.) Gund studied husbandry at State University from 1922 to 1923.( He made many trips to California and Nevada, often staying there for many months at a time, and became interested in a possible political career in Nevada.(Gund, p. 56.) He purchased a large cattle ranch in Nevada,( but on May 23, 1936, he married Jessica Laidlaw Roesler.(Gund-Roesler. New York Times. May 24, 1936.) She was the granddaughter of Bedell Laidlaw, the founder of one of the first investment banking houses in New York City, Laidlaw & Company.(Van Tassel and Grabowski, p. 479.) Gund purchased a large home in Beachwood, a wealthy suburb of Cleveland,( and the couple had six children: George III, Agnes, Gordon, Graham, Geoffrey, and Louise.(Rutherford, p. 51.)In 1937, Gund was elected a director of the Cleveland Trust Company (a savings bank established in 1896),( and was named president in 1941.( He was made chairman of the board of trustees in 1962.(Bank Elevates Officers. New York Times. February 7, 1962.) Under Gunds leadership, by 1967 the bank had more than $2 billion in assets,( making it the 18th largest bank in the United States. Gund also served on the board of directors of another 30 national and multinational corporations.(Keele and Kiger, p. 155.) But despite the urban nature of his work, Gund never lost his affection for the Old West.

In 1952, Gund established The George Gund Foundation.(American Library Association, p. 588.) His will bequeathed the bulk of his $600 million fortune to the foundation.(Gund served on the Board of Overseers of Harvard University, was a trustee of Kenyon College, and was a member of the advisory lay board of directors of Carroll University.( He also served two terms on the Advisory Council of the Fourth Federal Reserve District in the mid-1950s.(Renamed to Advisory Council. New York Times. December 24, 1953.)A number of buildings and places are named for Gund, due to his philanthropic generosity.

Economy_of_Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa
The economy of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province of Pakistan, is the 3rd largest in the country. Pakhtunkhwas share of Pakistans total GDP has historically comprised 10.5%, although the province accounts for 11.9% of Pakistans total population, rendering it the second-poorest province after neighboring Balochistan. The part of the economy that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa dominates is forestry, where its share has historically ranged from a low of 34.9% to a high of 81%, giving an average of 61.56%.() Currently, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa accounts for 10% of Pakistans GDP,() 20% of Pakistans mining output() and since 1972, it has seen its economy grow in size by 3.6 times.()After suffering for decades due to the fallout of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, today they are again are being targeted for totally a different situation of terrorism.Agriculture remains important and the main cash crops include wheat, maize, Tobacco (in Swabi), rice, sugar beets, as well as various fruits are grown in the province.Some manufacturing and high tech investments in Peshawar has helped improve job prospects for many locals, while trade in the province involves nearly every product. The bazaars in the province are renowned throughout Pakistan. Unemployment has been reduced due to establishment of industrial zones.Numerous workshops throughout the province support the manufacture of small arms and weapons of various types. The province accounts for at least 78% of the marble production in Pakistan.()References

James_M._Kellie
James M. Pothole Kellie (December 6, 1848( &ndash; 1927() was a miner and political figure in Columbia. He represented West Kootenay from 1890 to 1894, Kootenay North from 1894 to 1898 and Kootenay-Revelstoke from 1898 to 1899 in the Assembly of British Columbia.He was born in Ontario; his parents were natives of Scotland.()Kellie acquired the nickname of Pothole when he was prospecting for gold in Golden around 1884. He was convinced that there was gold to be found in two deep potholes in Canyon Creek. Kellie and his two partners eventually succeeded in diverting the creek, only to find the decaying leg of a mountain goat.()In 1889, Kellie and twelve other miners upset with taxation on their mines persuaded Robson, who was passing through by train, to stop over and listen to their complaints. The outcome was that Kellie was elected to the assembly and was able to sit on the committee drafting a new Mineral and Placer Mining Act. He later served in the cabinet as Minister of Mines.(Kellie mined quartz in the Kootenay region. In 1890, he moved to Revelstoke, where he founded the Miners Association. Kellie retired from politics in 1899 to look after his mining and lumber business interests. In 1913, he moved to Victoria.() References

Hargreaves_Review_of_Intellectual_Property_and_Growth
thumb|250px|Review cover pageThe Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth, or Digital Opportunity - A review of Intellectual Property and Growth, was an independent review of the Kingdoms property (IP) system, focusing on copyright law. Professor Hargreaves was commissioned to chair a review of how the IP framework supports economic growth and innovation in November 2010 by Minister Cameron. The review was published in May 2011 and made 10 recommendations to ensure that the UK has an IP framework best suited to supporting innovation and promoting economic growth in the digital age.() Findings of the review According to the Hargreaves review the frequency of major IP reviews in the UK indicates the shortcomings of the UK system. There have been four major IP reviews in the past six years, and of the 54 recommendations of the 2006 Review of Intellectual Property only 25 have been implemented. According to the Hargreaves review on copyright issues, lobbying on behalf of rights owners has been more persuasive to Ministers than economic impact assessments. Therefore the Hargreaves review adopted the importance of an IP framework which adapts well to change in technology and markets as guiding theme. The Hargreaves review found that IP policy making in the UK is not evidence based, a criticism that had already been made in the 1970s by the Banks Review and the 2006 Gowers Review.() In the foreword to the review Professor Hargreaves summarised what he calls David Camerons exam question as Could it be true that laws designed more than three centuries ago with the express purpose of creating economic incentives for innovation by protecting creators rights are today obstructing innovation and economic growth? According to Hargreaves The short answer is: yes. We have found that the UKs intellectual property framework, especially with regard to copyright, is falling behind what is needed.()According to the review property (IP) policy is an increasingly important tool for stimulating economic growth. However, the proliferating use of IP rights can increase IP transaction costs and prevent small innovative companies from entering the market. Digital creative industries rank third in UK exports, behind advanced engineering and financial and professional services. According to the review the further global growth of these businesses requires an efficient digital market in the UK where copyright is licensed speedily and effectively. The review noted the need for IP law to adapt to change as digital communication technology involves the routine copying of text, images and data. But finds that the IP framework has fallen behind and now acts as a regulatory barrier to the creation of new internet based businesses.() The review concludes that in order to allow the UK Property Office (IPO) to support innovation and promote economic growth on the basis of evidence,  institutional changes need to be made. It recommends that for the first time since its creation as the Patent Office, the IPO should be given an overarching legal mandate to pursue economic objectives, and the powers necessary to make evidence based recommendations to for example the UK competition authorities.()  Copyright licensing The review notes that numerous respondents to the review call for evidence made submissions on the defects in licensing, including the CBI, International, Pearson, Elsevier, UK photographers, and the Publishers Council. On the basis of these submissions the review concluded that there is a need to make it easier for large and small copyright owners to sell licences in their work and for others to buy them. Market transaction need to be faster, more automated and cheaper to establish a UK market in digital copyright where disputes are readily resolved without costly litigation. Easier cross border licensing in the EU and bulk licensing of digital content through rights management by societies could allow the UK to build its competitive advantage and become the centre for IP matters in the European time zone.() Copyright exceptions The review also urges the UK Government to take long overdue action to update copyright law in ways designed to increase consumer confidence in the way the law works. According to the review scientific and text mining techniques are prohibited by copyright law. Noting that the UK has chosen not to implement all exceptions permitted under EU law, the review draws attention to the fact that UK copyright law does not allow individuals to shift the format of a piece of music or video for personal use, to make use of a copyrighted work in parody, nor does UK copyright law allow libraries to archive all digital copyright material. Taking full advantage of the EU sanctioned exceptions would, according to the review, bring cultural and economic benefits, as well as making copyright law better understood and more acceptable to the public.() According to the review the copyright regime cannot be considered fit for the digital age when millions of citizens are in daily breach of copyright, simply for shifting a piece of music or video form one device to another. People are confused about what is allowed and what is not, with the risk that the law falls into disrepute. According to the review the UK could achieve many of the benefits of the US use doctrine by fully implementing the copyright exceptions permitted under EU law. In order to future proof copyright law so that it accommodates future technological developments and activities which do not threaten the interest of copyright owners, the UK should argue for additional copyright exceptions at EU level.() Copyright infringement On the basis of a UK and international data on the level of infringement the review found that very little of it is supported by transparent research criteria. Meanwhile sales and profitability in most creative business sectors appear to be holding up relatively well. The review concludes that many creative businesses are experiencing turbulences due to digital copyright infringement, but that at the level of the whole economy, measurable impacts are not as stark as is sometimes suggested. Existing research indicates that tougher enforcement alone will not solve the problem of copyright infringement and the review recommends that the UK Government should respond in four ways: by modernising copyright law, through education, through enforcement and by doing all it can to encourage open and competitive markets in licensed digital content to increase legitimate digital content at prices which appeal to consumers. According to the review strong online enforcement measures made possible by the Economy Act should be carefully monitored so that the approach can be adjusted in the light of evidence. The review acknowledges the importance of smaller companies to innovation and job creation and concludes that the advice and information provided to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) on IP is insufficient. The review recommends that SMEs should be given access to lower cost IP advice and for the establishment of a claims track to better resolve the many lower value IP disputes involving SMEs.()  Patents and design The review also found that the UK patent and design system needs to adapt to changing circumstances. According to the review technological developments and a very strong growth in the levels of patenting, especially in computer programs and telecommunications, has led to the emergence of so called thickets which obstruct entry to markets and hinder innovation. The growing design sector is the largest source of intangible investment in the UK economy and the emergence of 3D printing has increased the need for a thourough reassessment of IP and design.()  Recommendations * 1. Evidence: Government should ensure that development of the IP System is driven as far as possible by objective evidence. Policy should balance measurable economic objectives against social goals and potential benefits for rights holders against impacts on consumers and other interests. These concerns will be of particular importance in assessing future claims to extend rights or in determining desirable limits to rights.*2. International priorities: The UK should resolutely pursue its international interests in IP, particularly with respect to emerging economies such as China and India, based upon positions grounded in economic evidence. It should attach the highest immediate priority to achieving a unified EU patent court and EU patent system, which promises significant economic benefits to UK business. The UK should work to make the Cooperation Treaty a more effective vehicle for international processing of patent applications.*3. Copyright licensing: In order to boost UK firms access to transparent, contestable and global digital markets, the UK should establish a cross sectoral Digital Copyright Exchange. Government should appoint a senior figure to oversee its design and implementation by the end of 2012. A range of incentives and disincentives will be needed to encourage rights holders and others to take part. Governance should reflect the interests of participants, working to an agreed code of practice. The UK should support moves by the European Commission to establish a framework for cross border copyright licensing, with clear benefits to the UK as a major exporter of copyright works. societies should be required by law to adopt codes of practice, approved by the IPO and the UK competition authorities, to ensure that they operate in a way that is consistent with the further development of efficient, open markets.*4. Orphan works: The Government should legislate to enable licensing of works. This should establish extended collective licensing for mass licensing of orphan works, and a clearance procedure for use of individual works. In both cases, a work should only be treated as an orphan if it cannot be found by search of the databases involved in the proposed Digital Copyright Exchange.*5. Limits to copyright: Government should firmly resist over regulation of activities which do not prejudice the central objective of copyright, namely the provision of incentives to creators. Government should deliver copyright exceptions at national level to realise all the opportunities within the EU framework, including shifting, parody, non-commercial research, and library archiving. The UK should also promote at EU level an exception to support text and analytics. The UK should give a lead at EU level to develop a further copyright exception designed to build into the EU framework adaptability to new technologies. This would be designed to allow uses enabled by technology of works in ways which do not directly trade on the underlying creative and expressive purpose of the work. The Government should also legislate to ensure that these and other copyright exceptions are protected from override by contract.*6. Patent thickets and other obstructions to innovation: In order to limit the effects of these barriers to innovation, the Government should: take a leading role in promoting international efforts to cut backlogs and manage the boom in patent applications by further extending work sharing with patent offices in other countries; work to ensure patents are not extended into sectors, such as non-technical computer programs and business methods, which they do not currently cover, without clear evidence of benefit; investigate ways of limiting adverse consequences of thickets, including by working with international partners to establish a patent fee structure set by reference to innovation and growth goals rather than solely by reference to patent office running costs. The structure of patent renewal fees might be adjusted to encourage patentees to assess more carefully the value of maintaining lower value patents, so reducing the density of patent thickets.*7. The design industry: The role of IP in supporting this important branch of the creative economy has been neglected. In the next 12 months, the IPO should conduct an evidence based assessment of the relationship between design rights and innovation, with a view to establishing a firmer basis for evaluating policy at the UK and European level. The assessment should include exploration with design interests of whether access to the proposed Digital Copyright Exchange would help creators protect and market their designs and help users better achieve legally compliant access to designs.*8. Enforcement of IP rights: The Government should pursue an integrated approach based upon enforcement, education and, crucially, measures to strengthen and grow legitimate markets in copyright and other IP protected fields. When the enforcement regime set out in the Economy Act 2010 becomes operational next year its impact should be carefully monitored and compared with experience in other countries, in order to provide the insight needed to adjust enforcement mechanisms as market conditions evolve. This is urgent and Ofcom should not wait until then to establish its benchmarks and begin building data on trends. In order to support rights holders in enforcing their rights the Government should introduce a small claims track for low monetary value IP claims in the Patents County Court.*9. Small firm access to IP advice: The IPO should draw up plans to improve accessibility of the IP system to smaller companies who will benefit from it. This should involve access to lower cost providers of integrated IP legal and commercial advice.*10. An IP system responsive to change: The IPO should be given the necessary powers and mandate in law to ensure that it focuses on its central task of ensuring that the UKs IP system promotes innovation and growth through efficient, contestable markets. It should be empowered to issue statutory opinions where these will help clarify copyright law. As an element of improved transparency and adaptability, Government should ensure that by the end of 2013, the IPO publishes an assessment of the impact of those measures advocated in this review which have been accepted by Government..() UK Government endorsement On the 3 August the government endorsed the recommendations of the review. Plans for the implementation of recommendations The government announced that it would make arrangements to establish a Digital Copyright Exchange to facilitate copyright licensing and that the exchange would operate as a genuine marketplace independent of sellers and purchasers like amazon.com. A progress report is to be published by end 2011 and the exchange should be set up by the end of 2012. While government will not run the exchange, it will make works subject to copyright available through the exchange and will encourage public bodies to do likewise. The of State for Business, Innovation and Skills Cable announced at the 3 August press conference that a champion would be appointed to lead the work. According to the government implementing the exceptions permitted under the Directive would be beneficial and that exceptions should not be undermined by contracts. Proposals for a limited private copying exception, an exception for parody, and broader exceptions for non-commercial research and library archiving in copyright law are to be published in autumn 2011.(Managing IP ) The government announced that proposals for the commercial and cultural uses of works, works for which the copyright owner is not known or cannot be traced, would also be published in autumn 2011. Safeguards for the protection of copyright owners, such as a requirement for a diligent search, licensing at market rates and provisions for copyright owners who come forward at a later stage, are to be put in place. The government announced that it would respond to concerns about societies and in order to promote good practice minimum standards for voluntary codes would be published early 2012. A backstop power was to be made available where a collecting society has failed to introduce or meet the minimum standards. The government also committed to introducing a small claims track in the County Court (PCC), which is to be renamed the Intellectual Property County Court, for cases worth less than 5,000 ($8,000). The small claims track would be designed to provide access to the courts in straightforward, low-value disputes, and should particularly benefit small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in relation to copyright, design and possibly trade mark cases.(Managing IP )References( External links * Digital Opportunity - A review of Intellectual Property and Growth* Supporting documents to the Review* Submissions to the review call for evidence

Economic_history_of_Sweden
 1790-1815 - Agricultural revolution and protoindustrialization During the period 1790-1815 Sweden experienced two parallell economic movements: an agricultural revolution with larger agricultural estates, the crown transferring areas to private farmers, new crops and farming tools and a commercialization of farming, and a protoindustrialisation, with small industries being established in the countryside and with workers switching between agricultural work in the summer season and industrial production in the winter season. This led to economic growth benefiting large sections of the population and leading up to a consumption revolution starting in the 1820s. It also led to rapid demographic increase. 1815-1850 - Industrial revolution, regional specialization and institutional changes In the period 1815-1850 the protoindustries developed into more specialized and larger industries. This period witness increasing regional specialization with mining in Bergslagen, textile mills in Sjuhradsbygden and forestry in Norrland. Several important institutional changes took place in this period, such as free and mandatory public schooling introduced 1842 (as the first country in the world), the abolishment of a previous national monopoly on trade in handicrafts - the skrvsendet - in 1846, and a stock company law in 1848. 1850-1890 - Export growth, railroads and investment take off During the period 1850-1890 Sweden witnessed a veritable explosion in its export sector, with agricultural crops, wood and steel being the three dominating categories. Important institutional changes in this period included the abolishment of most tariffs and other barriers to free trade in the 1850s and the introduction of the gold standard in 1873, linking the Swedish krona at a fixed parity to gold. These institutional changes helped the expansion of free trade. During this period Swedens investment quota (investments/GDP) went from 5% to 10%, called take off. During this period modern economic growth, with yearly GDP growth of around 2% made its advent in Sweden. Large infrastructural investments were made during this period, mainly in the expanding rail road network, which was financed in part by the government and in part by private enterprises. 1890-1950 - Second industrial revolution During the period 1890-1930 the industrial revolution took place in Sweden. During this period new industries developed, with their focus on the domestic market: mechanical engineering, power utilities, papermaking and textile industries. The rapid expansion of these industries was clearly helped by the existence of a well functioning risk capital market: the Stockholm Stock Exchange was established in 1866, the Bank of Sweden (founded in 1668 as the first central bank in the world) in 1897 was given legal rights as the sole issuer of bank notes in Sweden and given status as lender of last resort, this making it easier to establish small independent private commercial banks, leading to an rapid expansion in the number of private banks and also to a rapid credit expansion. The private banks issued loans to start-up companies, with stocks as security. As the company was in business and showing positive business figures, the stocks were sold on the stock market, enabling the bank to lend the money to other start-up companies. The rapid credit expansion led to bank crisis in 1907, and also a property market collaps. Having imported vast amounts of foreign capital to finance its industrialization, during a 60 year period, from 1850 to 1910, Sweden was probably one of the leading debtor nations in the world by 1910. This situation would change rapidly in the coming decade. In 1914 the First World War commenced and international demand for Swedish exports of strategically important products such as steel, to be used in the armaments industry, increased rapidly. The warring nations had imposed severe limitations on trade between each other, as a neutral country, Sweden was not affected by these restrictions. The warring nations, such as the UK, to a large extent used the printing of new money as a means of financing the war, leading to inflation and thus causing the prices for Swedish exports to rise rapidly. The massive transfers of foreign money as payments for wartime Swedish exports meant that Sweden went from having been one of the most indebted nations in the world before the war, to being a net creditor after the war.Referencesekonomiska historia

Cournil
Alter Turbo.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Cournils design later turned up as a Portuguese UMM vehicle.Bernard Cournil was a French vehicle maker who progressed from improving other peoples vehicles to manufacturing his own during the late 1950s.  Rights to manufacture his design were subsequently held by a succession of businesses in Portugal after the French creator of the vehicle had disappeared from the pictureThe manBernard Cournil was born in Aurillac in April 1909.   He was a passionate engineer and, as a young man, closely involved with the de France, before returning to his native Cantal where he set up an automobile workshop business which as the next war progressed and the oil ran out, specialised in converting cars to run on wood based gazogne fuel. ()   Improving the JeepAfter the war Cournil found a stock of US built Jeeps that had been left behind, and these he adapted and maintained for agricultural use.   When Hotchkiss began to assemble Jeeps under license in France, it was a natural progression for Cournil to become a regional distributor for the Hotchkiss built Jeep, and in 1954 he went a stage further, concluding his own licensing agreement with Willys Jeep for assembling their vehicle. (      Little by little Cournil now progressed from assembling Jeeps to improving them.   Responding to a perceived concern over the robustness of the standard gear-box, Cournil substituted gearwheels derived from castings which he machined in his own workshops.   He then started looking for an engine that would be more reliable than the ones provided from Hotchkiss, initially substituting a diesel unit from Ferguson.   By the early 1960s he had decided that the Hotchkiss Jeep was insufficiently robust for the agricultural challenges of central France, and had substituted his own virtually indestructible four-wheel drive vehicle which had progressed a long way beyond the original Jeep design and which in the Mining industry acquired the soubriquet Tracteur Cournil. (   The date when Cournil is seen as having become a vehicle manufacturer in his own right lies somewhere between 1958 and 1960, and it is probably also at about this time that the business relocated from Aurillac to Saint-Germain-Laval.A series of afterlivesThe Bernard Cournil company of (Loire) progressed to vehicle manufacturing  in 1958 or 1960.   From 1977 the vehicles were produced under licence in Portugal by UMM.   The business was acquired by the Socit I.D.M.I. company in 1980 and in 1983/84 the vehicle was briefly renamed as the Autoland.   In 1985 Auverland took over the business and after this the vehicle was marketed as the Auverland.Sources and further reading* Harald H. Linz, Halwart Schrader: Die groe Automobil-Enzyklopdie.

Atlantas a Center for Health-care Newsletters. Atlanta Business Chronicle. April 21, 1995):The articles in AIDS Weekly discussed all aspects of the disease from social issues to medical research, aiming to leave nothing unreported.(   To cover emerging events and research, the newsweekly included shorts.(  Shorts explained as much as was known about currently unfolding information and events, promising that more would follow.(:Before the World Wide Web, NewsRx coordinated with the National AIDS Information Clearinghouse to provide information on the disease.(Moore, Lisa. AIDS Bulletin. US News and World Report. June 6, 1988: 83)   The CDC AIDS Weekly Infoline provided a list of upcoming AIDS seminars as well as names and addresses of over 65 AIDS periodicals published worldwide.(:The information published in AIDS Weekly came primarily from the CDC whose national headquarters was located in the same neighborhood as NewsRx.(   Though the newsweekly had no direct ties to the CDC other than as a source for information, a CDC official described the publication as highly informative. (   Other sources of information for this and other titles were the nearby University medical library and international agencies.(   Articles included summaries of peer-reviewed research, conference reports, news releases, and compilations from other health and medical organizations.(NewsRx Weekly Reports. Dialog, November 10, 2003. Web. 24 Aug 2011. ):The company upholds the principle that important medical health information belongs to the public.(   However, in the beginning, some critics feared that the AIDS virus was becoming a source of commercial income for companies, who would neglect to contribute to AIDS education and research, opting instead to make a profit.(  Some were offended by the fact that NewsRx was a non-governmental agency reporting statistics that were considered to be exclusive to the government.(Laermer, Richard. A Source of News on AIDS. Editor and Publisher September 5, 1987)   (see Controversy):In 1988, NewsRx added Cancer Weekly to the first journal on AIDS,((Ricklefs, Roger.

Waffles_(machine_learning)
Waffles is a collection of command-line tools for performing learning operations developed at Young University. These tools are written in C++, and are available under the Lesser General Public License.DescriptionThe Waffles machine learning toolkit() contains command-line tools for performing various operations related to learning, mining, and modeling. The primary focus of Waffles is to provide tools that are simple to use in scripted experiments or processes. For example, the supervised learning algorithms included in Waffles are all designed to support multi-dimensional labels, classification and regression, automatically impute missing values, and automatically apply necessary filters to transform the data to a type that the algorithm can support, such that arbitrary learning algorithms can be used with arbitrary data sets. Many other machine learning toolkits provide similar functionality, but require the user to explicitly configure data filters and transformations to make it compatible with a particular learning algorithm. The algorithms provided in Waffles also have the ability to automatically tune their own parameters (with the cost of additional computational overhead).Because Waffles is designed for script-ability, it deliberately avoids presenting its tools in a graphical environment. It does, however, include a graphical wizard tool that guides the user to generate a command that will perform a desired task. This wizard does not actually perform the operation, but requires the user to paste the command that it generates into a command terminal or a script. The idea motivating this design is to prevent the user from becoming locked in to a graphical interface.All of the Waffles tools are implemented as thin wrappers around functionality in a C++ class library. This makes it possible to convert scripted processes into native applications with minimal effort.Waffles was first released as an open source project in 2005. Since that time, it has been developed at Young University, with a new version having been released approximately every 69 months. Waffles is not an acronymthe toolkit was named after the food for historical reasons.AdvantagesSome of the advantages of Waffles in contrast with other popular open source machine learning toolkits include:* Waffles automatically takes care of many issues related to data format in order to simplify its tools.* Because it is implemented in C++, many of its algorithms are particularly fast. Also, the lack of dependency on any virtual machine makes it easier to deploy in conjunction with other applications.* The functionality included in Waffles is very broad, including algorithms for dimensionality reduction, collaborative filtering, visualization, clustering, supervised learning, optimization, linear algebra, data transformation, image and signal processing, policy learning, and sparse matrix operations.Disadvantages* Although Waffles provides significant breadth, it lacks the depth of many toolkits that focus on a particular area of machine learning. The (machine learning) toolkit, for example, provides many more classification algorithms than Waffles provides.* Waffles only has a limited graphical interface.See also* (machine learning)* RapidMiner (formerly YALE (Yet Another Learning Environment)), an open-source machine learning framework implemented in Java, fully integrating Weka* of numerical analysis softwareReferences

Informing_science
Informing science is a transdiscipline that was established to promote the study of informing processes across a diverse set of academic disciplines, including management information systems, education, business, instructional technology, computer science, communications, psychology, philosophy, library science, information science and many others. Its principal unit of analysis is the informing system, a collection of informers, clients and channels that has been designed or has evolved to serve a particular informing need. The organization created to advance the informing science transdiscipline is the Informing Science Institute (ISI), whose founder, Eli Cohen, proposed the need for field in his article Reconceptualizing Information Systems as a Field of the Transdiscipline Informing Science: From Ugly Duckling to Swan (Cohen, 1999). The ISI presently host an annual conference (Informing Science & Information Technology Education (InSITE)), publishes seven academic journals, and--through its Informing Science Press--has published for dozens of books. Both its journals and books are open access at no cost online, as well as being available for purchase in print form.HistoryInforming science came into being as a transdiscipline around 1998. During that year, two key events occured. The seminal article that defined the field (Cohen, 1999) was accepted for publication and the fields flagship journal--Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline--was launched.The theme of Cohens (1999) article was relatively simple, and resonated with many in the global academic community. In brief, he argued that many different disciplines are studying the same types of of issues: teaching programming, communicating effectively, designing systems to provide information to clients, and so forth, as illustrated in Table 1. This situation was not only inefficient from a research standpoint, but it also tended to promote research silos in which researchers from one discipline were unable to benefit from the research of colleagues in other disciplines. In the long run, he asserted that such a situation would be highly deleterious to our overall understanding of these processes. He expressed particular concern with the situation in his own research discipline, management information systems, which was already becoming fragmented and increasingly irrelevant to practice.  What Cohen proposed as an antidote to this situation was the establishment of an interdisciplinary community of researchers described as follows::The fields that comprise the discipline of Informing Science provide their clientele with information in a form, format and schedule that maximizes its effectiveness (Cohen, 1999, p. 215)During its earliest years, the informing science discipline was particularly focused on issues related to management information systems and information/library science--the fields from which many of its researchers originated. Over time, however, instructional technology became an important area of research, leading to the establishment of additional journals in the informing science in the education and instructional technology areas.In recent years, an effort has been made to further broaden the field. In 2009, the collection Foundations of Informing Science (Gill & Cohen, 2009) was published, including both seminal articles from its journals and new contributions. The collection included chapters related to economics, decision theory, political science, education, design, complexity science and mining.Currently, the informing science field is encouraging interest in research that is not necessarily related to technology. In a recent keynote address given at InSITE 2011 by T. Grandon Gill, the editor-in-chief of the journal Informing Science proposed that the field could be described as follows::Informing Science is the transdisciplinary study of systems that employ information to impact clienteleIn that same address, a number of areas meriting additional research were proposed. These included:# Greater emphasis on informing systems that evolve, as opposed to those that are are created by design# Study of informing through non-symbolic means, such as body language and music, as well as through language and the exchange of coded data# Paying greater attention to the topologies of informing systems as opposed to emphasizing Sender  Receiver communications models whose roots go back to Shannon (Shannon & Weaver, 1949)# Obstacles to informing, such as bias and heuristics, that are particularly challenging when human clients are involved# The relationship of informing systems structure and the complexity of the the message being conveyedInforming SystemsThe basic unit of analysis for informing science is the informing system. According to the original Cohen (1999) article, such systems consist of three components: an informing environment, a delivery system and a task completion system, as shown in Figure 1:The delivery system represented the combination of technological and non-technological elements that comprised the communications channel. The informing environment represented the system components of the system on the informers (senders) side. The task completion system involved the components of the system related to the client (user, receiver) of the information. This particular conception, illustrated in Figure 2, allowed the model map well to Shannons communication model.Topology of Informing SystemsWhile the basic model did, and still does, serve as a useful unit of analysis, it was pointed out that real world informing systems come in many topologies, as illustrated in Figure 3.Among the variations of systems listed are the following (Gill & Bhattacherjee, 2007, p. 19):# Sender and client components are rarely homogeneous. Rather, senders consist of complex informing environments that involve subsystems that may, themselves, be informing systems. The same can be said of clients...# Senders may be members of multiple informing systems that inform different clients. Drucker (1989), for example, refers to the inherent tension that knowledge workers experience as they divide their loyalties between profession (e.g., accounting, law, medicine) and the organization that employs them.# Multiple senders may compete to inform the same client. For example different departments(disciplines) may compete for the same set of students; doctors from different specialties may compete to diagnose the same patients, etc.# Multiple communications pathways may be utilized within the same informing system. For example, an advertising campaign may involve the use of print, broadcast and webbased media in order to reach its entire client base.# Multiple clients may be informed by the same sender, and may have to compete for that senders attention. For example, a patient may find his or her case is neglected as a consequence of the attention a doctor pays to the needs of other patients.# Clients may, themselves, serve as part of an extended informing system. For example, a company may depend heavily on word of mouth advertising to gain new clients.Construction of Informing SystemsGiven the fields origins in management information systems (MIS) research, it is not unexpected that early investigations into, and conceptualizations of, the development of informing systems tended to rely heavily on technology-based experienced. Cohen (1999), for example, viewed informing systems as having three levels:# The informing instance level, where actual informing activities took place.# The construction level, at which new informing instances were created according to the prevailing design templates.# The design level, at which new architectures for informing were realized.As examples, he proposed (Cohen, 1999, p. 217):: (1) teaching a course someone else has designed, (2) designing a course that will be taught by others, and (3) creating a new curriculum. A business example is (1) using an existing transaction processing system (TPS), (2) creating a TPS following general design rules, and (3) creating a new type of TPS.As illustrated in Figure 4, Gill and Bhattacherjee (2007) further expanded the concept with the example of academic informing systems, which can be descibed in terms of two related informing systems that share many of the same clients. The disciplinary system represents the research field with which faculty members and departments are aligned. The institutional system represents the activities of the college or university, primarily focused on informing student clients.  In subsequent publications (e.g., Gill, 2009a), informing science researchers have also begun to address the issue of how such systems can evolve, as opposed to being a pure product of design. The importance of understanding these informal processes for informing system development--even for IT-based systems--has been underscored by the rapid acceptance of technologies such as social media. There is little question that users have adapted these technologies for their own informing purposes in ways far beyond those anticipated by the original designers of the systems.Informing Science ResearchIn informing science, the term transdiscipline refers to the idea that a common problem--in this case the challenges presented by informing--may benefit from the diversity of insights and prespectives offered by multiple disciplines, sometimes referred to as the component disciplines or client disciplines of informing science. To foster such a collaboration among researchers, however, requires extending the notion of of what constitutes research. It has also led to the development of a number of parallel research streams.Extending the Definition of ResearchIn an open letter to the informing science community describing the types of research appropriate for the field, the Editor-in-Chief of Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline T. Grandon Gill made the following statement (Gill, 2009b, p. vi)::The transdisciplinary character of InformSciJ requires that we be willing to publish a broad array of contributions. In many of our client fields, most published research contributions can be characterized as either theory-building or theory-testing. While submissions of this type are, of course, encouraged, we will also consider a broader range of contributions, including::* Synthesis: An existing body of theory and observations are organized into a more cohesive whole. A literature review may fall into this category, but only if it attempts to propose a novel systematic organization for the existing literature.:* Illustration: The meaning or implications of a particular theory are explained and clarified through an illustrative example. In the business literature, for example, nearly all practitioner-directed publications use this technique extensively.:* Unexplained Observation: A rich observation, often having properties not well explained with existing theory, that is offered without serious attempt to incorporate it into theory. It is interesting to note that while research of the form I observed this but I cant explain it would be nearly impossible to publish in any social science journal known to me, such anomalous observations often form the basis for scientific revolution (Kuhn, 1970)such as the Michelson Morley experiment, which paved the way for Einsteins special relativity.: We must never forget that our transdisciplinary mission demands that we view facilitating informing across the client disciplines as an important form of research. Providing a reader in one discipline with a novel perspectiveeven if that perspective is not necessarily novel in the discipline of the authoris a necessary part of transdisciplinary knowledge creation.As a consequence of this expanded view of research, the journals and conferences sponsored by the ISI cover a very broad array of topics, research methods and styles of presentation.Research Themes in Informing ScienceAlthough much of the research in informing science does not fit within simple categories, there have been a number of themes that have captured the particular interest of researchers in the field. These include:* The nature of information and informing: Beginning with a special issue on information science research (Spink, 2000), the ambiguity associated with the use of terms such as information, data and knowledge in different disciplines has been a frequent topic (e.g., Callaos & Callaos, 2002; Knox, 2009).* The nature of complexity and its impact on informing: Efforts have been made both to define complexity more clearly (e.g., Gill & Hicks, 2006) and to better understand its impact on informing processes (e.g., Gill & Cohen, 2008).* Bridging the gap between research a practice: Launched by another special issue (Fitzgerald, 2003), this topic of why academic research is so often ignored by practice has been frequently explored (e.g. Gill & Bhattacherjee, 2007) and is one where the informing science perspective has also started to gain practice in client disciplines (e.g., Myers et al., 2011).* The impact of content delivery (e.g., multimedia, web) on informing processes: Examples include investigations of multimedia (e.g., Sharda, 2005), eLearning (e.g., Sarker & Nicholson, 2005) and adapting channels to highly restrictive informing environments (e.g., Spasic & Nesic, 2009).* Impact of bias, misinformation and disinformation on informing processes: Both theoretical and practical research has been devoted to understanding the role played by bias (e.g., Jamieson & Hyland, 2006), misinformation (Bednar and Welch, 2008; Christozov, Chukova and Mateev, 2009) and deception (e.g., Hutchinson, 2006) in informing processes.* The role of adaptation in informing system design and construction: Moving away from traditional MIS design models, such as the systems development lifecycle (SDLC), researchers have proposed drawing upon alternative metaphors, such as the double helix (e.g., Nissen, Bednar, & Welch, 2007), co-evolution (e.g., Pahl & Newnes, 2007) and approaches grounded in philosophy (e.g., Bednar & Welch, 2009).* The need to broaden approaches to research within client disciplines: Noting that positivist, empirical research methods do not necessarily yield useful results in many client disciplines, many researchers have proposed alternative approaches (e.g., Mende, 2005; Gill, 2011).Consistent with its roots in the MIS and education client disciplines, many articles published in Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline represent the types of research that might also be publishable within the client disciplines themselves. By 2010, however, the editorial policy had evolved. The Editor-in-Chief of the journal commented on the current state of policy in the following statement (Gill, 2010, p. v):: We also continue to publish work from many different disciplines and, particularly welcome, see that many of our articles represent collaborations between authors coming from different disci-plines. Such broad representation and collaboration is the lifeblood of a transdiscipline. It is all too easy for a journal to gravitate towards a particular perspective on research. It is heartening to see that the authors submitting their work to InformSciJ are resisting that tendency.: I am also happy to report that the linkage between our research and the general problem of informing has grown much tighter over the past two years. While there was a time when Inform-SciJ would publish almost any high quality submission from its contributing disciplines (e.g., MIS, education, communications, philosophy, instructional technology), that is no longer the case. Today, every article we publish identifies how its topic relates to informing. I will admit that, in the past, I have been somewhat heavy handed in enforcing that such a linkage be present. Recently, however, I have found authors increasingly taking it upon themselves to relate their findings to informing without my intervention. While the journal has missed the opportunity to publish some excellent work as a result, I am convinced that our long term interests are best served by being true to the central problem that we are studying.As a consequence of the gradual adoption of this policy, recent volumes of the journal have become both slimmer and size and more directly focused on the journals mission.Informing Science InstituteThe principal organizing body for the informing science transdiscipline is the Informing Science Institute (ISI). According to a recently published article (Murphy, 2011, p. 91): :Since its inception, it has published approximately 1,000 articles by over 1,000 authors from over 500 universities all across the globeIn that same article, the ISIs activities were described in informing system terms. These are illustrated in Figure 5.The ISI engages in a broad range of informing activities in support of the informing science transdiscipline. These include journal publications, organizing conferences, publishing books and offering services to members.JournalsThe ISI currently publishes seven journals. These are listed in Table 2. There are several common themes to these journals that have been established by the ISI. These include:* Free open access to the online version of every article is available as soon as each article is accepted for final publication and appropriately formatted* Articles are published under a Commons license, allowing others to freely use their content (with proper attribution)* Printed volumes are produced and made available for sale at the end of each year* Double blind peer review is employed. Editors are required to make mentorship of authors a high priority throughout the review process, however.The ISI family of journals is also somewhat unusual for a U.S.-based research publication in that its authorship is highly international in flavor. As shown in Figure 6, only about a third of its authors have been affiliated with U.S. academic institutions.InSITE ConferencesOne of the principal vehicles through which ISI informs its membership is through its Informing Science and IT Education conferences, held a a different location during June of every year since 2001. Attendance is typically between 100 and 160 participants. Conferences to date have been located as follows (Murphy, 2011, p. 117):* InSITE 2011 - Novi Sad, Serbia* InSITE 2010 - Cassino, Italy* InSITE 2009 - Macon, Georgia, USA* InSITE 2008 - Varna, Bulgaria* InSITE 2007 - Ljubljana, Slovenia* InSITE 2006 - Greater Manchester, England* InSITE 2005 - Flagstaff, Arizona, USA* InSITE 2004 - Rockhampton, Australia* InSITE 2003 - Pori, Finland* InSITE 2002 - Cork, Ireland* InSITE 2001 - Krakow, PolandRecent conferences have included four primary tracks (Murphy, 2011, p. 117-118):* InSITE: Connect consists of study in various locations on the transmission of information across time and across space. Connect focuses on the interrelationship between context (his-torical forces and culture) and information and knowledge transfer.* InSITE: Inform solicits papers in any area that explores issues in effectively and efficiently informing clients through information technology (IT).* InSITE: TeachIT focuses on research topics related to teaching IT, including curricular is-sues, capstone courses, pedagogy, and emerging topics in IT.* InSITE: TeLE focuses on research topics related to using IT to teach. For example, these topics include e-Learning, m-Learning, making classroom teaching more effective, and distance learning.ISI has instituted a fast track process for article submissions to InSITE conferences. After all conference submissions have been reviewed, the editor-in-chiefs of ISIs seven journals identify articles that are of particularly high quality and are also a good fit with the journals mission. Authors of these articles are then offered the opportunity to revise their submission for publication in the journal rather than in the conference proceedings.Informing Science PressThe Informing Science Press is the publishing arm of the ISI. Its catalog of books--all available online for free on Google Books and for purchase--encompass a wide range of subjects. Topics that have been published up through 2009 are summarized in Table 3.Future DirectionsAt the present time, the governing body of the Informing Science Institute is its Fellows. These Fellows traditionally meet during the InSITE conference. Among the plans recently discussed:* The development of an Introduction to Informing Science textbook, to be published in 2012, that will offer a clearer picture of the transdiscipline and its objectives* Future InSITE conferences are planned for Montreal, Canada (2012), Porto, Portugal (2013) and Wollongong, Australia (2014)References* Bednar, P. and Welch, C.

Teufelsteich
BESONDERHEITEN  The Teufelsteich was one of the oldest reservoirs in the Mountains of central Germany.It was built in 1697 near Harzgerode and Quedlinburg (in the present state of Saxony-Anhalt) for mining purposes. In 1837/38 it was raised to support silver mining.The Teufelsteich was first linked to the Harz Pond and Ditch System in 1903/04. The Kochsgraben was extended for the last time and it now ended in the catchment area of the Teufelsteich, the Siebengrund bottom. This extension was called the Graben; at the same time the section to Neudorf was drained dry. The Teufelsteich was now supplied with water from the  Lude stream and the Rdelbachgraben along with the nearby mining ponds of the Frstenteich and the Silberhtter Pochwerksteich.In 1947 the pond was used for the first time to supply drinking water. In 1985 the embankment had to be completely replaced. To do this a new dam was built 30 m below the old one and the old dam removed.The new, higher dam consists of a shale body with a clay core in the centre. The retaining capacity of the new dam is around 203,000 m greater. The reservoir now has new facilities such as a spillway, a bottom outlet, a glory hole spillway (Entnahmeturm) with service jetty, a valve house and a pump station.The impounded stream is the Teufelsgrundbach.

Cozens_Ranch_House
 refnum  88000709()The Cozens Ranch House in Colorado was built by William Cozens, sheriff of Central City after he married Mary York. Mary insisted that they leave the wild mining town, so the Cozens family relocated to Grand County, where they started a ranch in 1874. The homestead was the first in the Fraser Valley.()  The original ranch house was built of logs and expanded two years later as a stagecoach stop and post office. Six rooms were used as a hotel. At its height the ranch comprised . Mary Cozens willed the property to the Jesuits, who renamed the property Maryvale and use it as a retreat from the 1920s to the 1980s. In 1990 the ranch was restored to its late 1800s condition by the Grand County Historical Association It is operated as a museum.()The Cozens Ranch was placed on the Register of Historic Places on June 9, 1988.(ReferencesExternal links* Grand County Historical Association

Cross-border_Mining_Trail
The Cross-border Mining Education Trail (, ) from Graupen (German: Krupka) to Geising, Altenberg, Zinnwald and Cnovec (German:Bhmisch Zinnwald) to Dub (German: Eichwald) is a 40 km long mining history education trail in the upper Ore Mountains in Germany and the Republic. It links seventy sites (including museums, monuments, visitor mines, mining ponds and ditches, reclamations and tourist attractions) connected with the history of mining and settlement in this cross-border region of the Mountains. The educational trail describes the development of what was once the most important tin mining regions in Central Europe. In order to hike the trail, a walking map is recommended that contains detailed maps and short descriptions of the waypoints en route and the opening times of the museums.File:Altenberg Pinge (3) 2006-06-28.jpg|thumb|The Altenberg sinkhole, an important witness to mining history in the Eastern Ore Mountains Location The trail lies about 45 km south of Dresden on the upper slopes of the Eastern Ore Mountains. It is situated immediately on the Czech border and runs from Krupka (Graupen) via Horni Krupka (Obergraupen), the hrka (Mckenberg mountain) and Fojtovice (Voitsdorf) to Frstenau (the hiking trail counting as local border traffic). From Frstenau the path continues through Lwenhain, Geising and Altenberg to Zinnwald. Passing the old border crossing on the B 170 it runs through Cnovec (Vorderzinnwald) before returning to Krupka. On the way, the educational trail cuts through the source region of the White Mglitz river. See also *of mines in Germany References (naun hornick stezkaBergbaulehrpfad

The villainous Bilis Manger had schemed to ensure his freedom, manipulating the Torchwood Three crew. Bilis refers to Abaddon as his god.Abaddon killed all those who fell in his shadow; he devoured life. Captain Jack attempted to sacrifice himself by using his immortality to destroy the demon when it tried to absorb too much, leaving Jack dead for days but causing the monster to choke to death.Abaddon is also referred to in Twilight Streets, where Bilis reveals that Abaddon was actually an agent of the Light, sentient light particles that sought to imprison their Dark counterparts back in the rift; the energies Abaddon took from people were simply collateral damage as Abaddon gathered strength for the coming battle. Like all Torchwood spin-off media, the canonicity of these novels in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.Abaddons design is somewhat reminiscent of the Doctors foe, The Destroyer, most notably in the curved horns, long face, blue, scaly skin and animalistic snout.It is also referred to in Series 2 of Doctor Who by the Ood in the episode The Impossible Planet in terms of Beasts various aliases: Some may call it Abaddon.AbzorbaloffThis alien absorbs any living thing into its body by touch and then digests the organism.Adam SmithAdiposeThe Adipose are aliens composed of living fat, featured in the episode Partners in Crime. Their breeding world, Adipose 3, was lost, causing them to turn to Miss Foster, or Matron Cofelia of the Five Straighten Classabindi Nursery Fleet, Intergalactic Class, to create a new generation. She formulated a drug that would cause human fat (tissue) to morph by parthenogenesis into Adipose children. The process is generally harmless to the host beyond the loss of body fat; in emergencies the process can be accelerated, converting the hosts entire body, which is fatal to the host and produces ill and weak Adipose children.() The Proclamation.() forbids seeding, or breeding aliens, on a level 5 planet such as Earth. Level 5 means pre-warp capabilities, as said in Partners in crime.In the parallel universe created in Turn Left, the Adipose incident happened in America instead of the United Kingdom, as London was destroyed when the Titanic crashed into Buckingham Palace because of the absence of the Doctor (Voyage of the Damned). Over 60 million Americans (roughly 20% of the total population of the United States) were killed in this timeline as a result.In Stolen Earth and Journeys End it is revealed that the breeding planet, Adipose 3, was one of the 27 planets relocated to the Medusa Cascade by the New Dalek Empire. After their defeat, Adipose 3 and the other planets were returned to their original positions.In End of Time, an Adipose is shown in a bar along with other aliens the Tenth Doctor had previously encountered. Five Adipose figures were released as part of the first series 4 wave.AggedorAlien tumourA sentient alien tumour was shown to have grown on the brain of Owens fiance, Katie, in flashback sequences in Fragments. Attempting to operate on the young woman, all doctors present in the room were killed when the alien life form released a rapidly dissipating toxic nerve gas in self-defence. The effects of the tumour caused Katie to exhibit symptoms of early onset disease.Alpha CentauriAlzarianAncient LightsThe Ancient Lights were entities that controlled a universe before the Bang. Surviving the explosion, they endured and eventually passed their power into the human Martin Trueman, a low level middle-aged conman, in of the Stars. The Ancient Lights gave Trueman the power to control all life with an astrological sign, as well as other abilities such as energy blasts. These powers were based on ancient physics from the Lights native universe. Through Trueman, the Lights intended to enslave all life as they had done in their own universe. Luke Smiths artificial birth meant he had no astrological sign and could not be controlled by the Ancient Lights, allowing him to break Truemans hold over the people of Earth. As the Ancient Lights began to fade, Trueman (who had long believed he would have a special destiny) refused to give up his connection and became one with the Lights.AndrogumAnethanAnti-ManAquarbiLike the Greek centaur, these creatures are half-human and half-horse. In the book Pest Control, they are involved in a bitter battle with humans.Arcanus ServitorisThe Arcanus Servitoris is a secret organisation.ArcturusArgolinThe Argolin, who appeared in the Doctor story Leisure Hive by David Fisher, are the inhabitants of Argolis. In 2250, the Argolin, led by Theron, fought and lost a 20-minute nuclear war with the Foamasi. As a result of this war, the Argolin became sterile. They were long-lived, but when they neared the end of their life they aged and declined very rapidly.The Argolin who survived the war put aside their races traditional warlike ways and remade Argolis as the first of the leisure planets, catering to tourists from many worlds. They built a Leisure Hive dedicated to relaxation and cross-cultural understanding; due to radioactive fallout from the war, the Argolin planned to live in the Hive for at least three centuries. Argolis continued to struggle financially, and by 2290 faced possible bankruptcy. A rogue faction of Foamasi known as the West Lodge attempted to purchase the entire planet to use as a criminal base, sabotaging recreation facilities to encourage the Argolin to sell. The criminal nature of the offer was exposed by a Foamasi agent, aided by the Fourth Doctor and Romana.Since the Argolin were sterile, they attempted to renew their race using cloning and tachyonics, but only one of the clones, Pangol, survived to adulthood. Pangol was mentally unstable and obsessed with the Argolins former warrior culture. He attempted to create an army of tachyonic duplicates of himself, but was unsuccessful and was eventually restored to infancy through the same tachyonic technology that had created him.In appearance, Argolin are humanoids with greenish skin. Their heads are covered with what appears to be elaborately coiffed hair capped with small domes covered in beads, which fall off when the Argolin become sick or die.AridianArkanThe Arkan are a race mentioned and briefly glimpsed in Cyberwoman. They are described by Jack as being incredibly boring and mostly made of liquid, hence the cells would be a mess if they were interrogated at Torchwood. One of their leisure ships is spotted over Cardiff Bay. They are politely asked to leave Earths atmosphere via a message from Toshikos computer as they are spooking the locals.AtraxiThe Atraxi are a galactic police force, resembling eyeballs attached to crystalline structures; it is unclear whether these structures are their spaceships or the creatures themselves. These structures also appear briefly in Pandorica Opens.Attention SeekerReferred to as the Attention Seekers by Jack, these are aliens which are viewed as gods, appearing in a 2007 entry to the Torchwood website. Written in a pseudo-blog form, the Cardiffboyoboy blog story relays a young mans series of encounters with Jack Harkness during an alien invasion on the Cardiff gay clubbing scene.()The Attention Seekers are originally a race who are accustomed to worship as deities on their home, which they feed on. They travel place to place and from time to time, masquerading as gods and being worshipped by countless societies until they go out of fashion there. Finding themselves in the comparatively more secular but vain 21st century Britain, Captain Jack explains to the narrator Peter that it has been forced to assume the form of a strikingly beautiful person who draws power from all the attention drawn to them. However, rather than copulate with one man every night, Jack ambiguously describes that the creature ends up in the car park where it can get the serious devotion of a crowd, mentioning how its Odd how people still get on their knees to worship, isnt it?. Jack later explains though, that while it was originally relatively harmless in its activities, it has become increasingly hungry and thereby dangerous, so Jack is forced to kill it with a few clicks of his Time Agent Wrist-Strap, which he uses to trigger car alarms to clear the car park, and later a car explosion to kill the creature.AxonsBBandrilBaneTSJA.jpg|150px|thumb|Davey in his natural Bane form.The Bane, in their natural form, are large tentacled aliens with one eye. They appear in of the Bane and of the Bane. They exhibit some level of mind-reading abilities. Bane Mothers are particularly large and are known to eat members of their young who fail them. They are able to appear human through the use of image translators. The Bane sought to enslave mankind by getting them addicted to the soft drink, Bubble Shock!, which contained organic Bane secretion, which takes control of its human host when activated. Mrs Wormwood headed the Banes disguised human front and created the Archetype, Luke.BannermanBeesA story arc in Series 4 referred to the disappearance of bees, culminating in Stolen Earth, where it was revealed that some bees were aliens from Melissa Majoria who created a path the Doctor could follow to find Earth and the other planets stolen by the Daleks.Blade FinThe Blade Fin was a shark-like creature that prowled the waters around the flooded 23rd century London, now little more than a network of underwater tunnels codenamed Poseidon. When the Doctor and Amy land the TARDIS in Poseidon, the Blade Fin immediately attacks, attempting to ram its way into the glass tunnels. While constantly having to evade the monster, the two slowly unravell the mystery of Poseidon, which has fallen under threat from not only the Blade Fin, but also the Vashta Nerada and otherworldly radiation. They eventually discover that all the anomalies arrived at the city when the Eldridge, an American WWII-era ship which had vanished through a wormhole to another world hundreds of years ago, suddenly jumped back through into the sea several days ago. However, the ship became lodged in the wormhole and held it open, allowing the creatures and the radiation to seep through. The Doctor and Amy travel to the wreckage of the Eldridge and are able to close the wormhole; the Blade Fin is seen being dragged back to its own world, while the other anomalies disappear with it.BlathereenThe Blathereen are a family related to Slitheen, but are orange in colour and do not use skin suits. In the episode The Gift, a family of Slitheen-Blathereen landed on earth with a gift of friendship called rakweed. Mr Smith scans it and announces it harmless until Luke takes a high dose of rakweed spores and goes into a coma. Sarah Jane then confronts the Blathereen with a super soaker full of vinegar. She is captured but escapes using her sonic lipstick. Meanwhile Rani, Clyde and K9 discover that the bell destroys the spores of rakweed by drowning out the sound they make and interfering with their communication. Sarah Jane later uses this to kill the Blathereen.The BlessingIn Miracle Day The Blessing is revealed to be an antipodal geological formation connected to the Earths field running from Shanghai and Buenos Aires. Harkness theorises that it may have been caused by the interaction of Rachnos Huon particles and Silurian hibernation matrixes, though its origins are unknown. The Families are unsure of whether or not to classify the Blessing as alive or not, though it is stated to have a degree of sentience. One of its features is that it has the ability to show an approaching human the content of their own soul, which has caused some to commit suicide, others to find convinction. The Mother believed that this reaction was a result of the Blessing attempting to communicate with the Human Race.In Blood Line it is revealed that the worldwide immortality investigated by Torchwood was a result of Jacks blood being introduced to The Blessings Morphic Field. It is implied that this was a result of the Blessing interpreting The Families interference as a threat, and the subsequent immortality being a gift of kindness to humanity. Jack and Rex (who has been infused with Jacks blood) manage to reset the Miracle through exposing it to Jacks (now mortal) blood at each end of the Blessing. However, The Blessing does not Reset everything back to the way it was and, perhaps as a result of the presence of Jacks blood, brings Rex back as also immortal.BlowfishAn otherwise unnamed, humanoid, bipedal alien blowfish features in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang. The blowfish, played by Kasey, holds part of Captain Johns puzzle box. It is possible that the Blowfish was known to John. Overcome by Earths pleasures, the blowfish takes cocaine, steals a car and takes a teenage girl hostage, only to attract the attention of Torchwood and the local media,() thus leading to its eventual demise.A young blowfish appears in the episode Fragments, in flashback sequences involving Jacks first mission for the Torchwood Institute, during which Jack captures the fish for committing various crimes but is then outraged when it is shot after being captured.A blowfish and two other fish-like creatures appear in the Magazine short story The Book of Jahi. The blowfish has taken on the name Mr. Glee and has been operating as a crime boss in Cardiff for some time.Brain ParasiteA brain parasite appears in the episode Sins as an intended tool of the Tricksters brigade. According to dialogue within the episode, brain parasites are a metre long with four hooked mandibles around the mouth. They implant their larvae using these hooked mandibles, travel to the brain, and eventually cause insanity.In 1927, the Tricksters Brigade obtained a brain parasite and brought it to America, planning to infect President Roosevelt and drive him insane, which would cause him to eventually drop out of War II and change the timeline. The Torchwood Institute learned of this and sent Jack Harkness to dispose of the parasite, which he did so with the help of Angelo Colasanto.Brain of MorphotonBruydacThe Bruydac feature in the novel, Another Life. Like all Torchwood spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.The Bruydac are a race of bipedal, humanoid aliens hailing from the eponymous planet, Bruydac. They are over 7 feet tall, have broad shoulders and long, thin arms ending in thick claws. They have exposed skulls featuring a bony ridge from the bridge of their nose, to the back of their head. Their eyes are covered by heavy lids and are red and white in colour. Bruydac appear to breathe in much the same way humans do, through their mouths, with their lungs in their chest.They possess slight psychic ability, and are able to possess humans from afar with the aid of a small device inserted into the spine of the victim. When under the control of a Bruydac, a small green-grey starfish-shaped creature begins to grow in the victims stomach which, when at a certain size, is ejected through the victims mouth. If placed in water, the starfish begins to grow. When exposed to oxygen the starfish gains the ability to digest any natural material, including rubber and living tissue.Bruydac ships accept several different forms of fuel, including nuclear, and are cylindrical in shape.In Another Life a Bruydac battle cruiser is slowly pushing its way through the Cardiff Rift causing adverse weather conditions in the entire bay. If the ship were to force its way the entire way through, it would send a wave down the entire Bristol channel comparable to a tsunami. The lone Bruydac warrior aboard the ship, injured after a crash that killed the rest of his crew, is waiting to recover and for a way to power his ship so that he may return home.Butterfly PeopleA translucent humanoid who possessed the body of a 19th century prostitute named Mary was encountered in the episode Greeks Bearing Gifts. She was a member of a race which communicated exclusively via telepathic pendants, and claimed to be a political exile, sent to Earth by a teleporter now in Torchwoods possession. At one point, Mary calls herself Philoctetes, in reference to his exile on Lemnos. She gave her telepathic necklace to Toshiko, and seduced her into letting her into Torchwood to regain the teleporter.On arriving on Earth in 1812, the alien killed her guard and possessed Mary. In this form she needed to consume human hearts to maintain the hosts youth, taking one a year.(Operation Lowry: Notes from Owen) Mary threatened Tosh in order to regain the teleporter and Jack exchanged it for Tosh. However, Jack had reprogrammed the coordinates, sending Mary into the center of the Sun instead of back to her homeworld.In Sarah Jane Adventures episode of the Bane, Jane Smith helps an alien of the same race to find its way home. It is later revealed that this alien was a star poet, from Arcateen V, who gave Sarah Jane a device via which she promised to help her with her poetry whenever she needs it. Mr Smiths Alien Files on the official The Sarah Jane Adventures website described her race as Butterfly People.(BBC - The Sarah Jane Adventures - Mr Smith) The Butterfly People are also referenced in the novel in the Water (published March 2008) where they are called Arcateenians. Like all Torchwood spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series remains unclear.Mary possessed strength large enough to shatter human bones in a manner resembling a gunshot and could move at superhuman speeds, also possessing acute senses able to notice that there was something different about Jack. The poet alien in The Sarah Jane Adventures was able to fly home with some assistance from Sarah Jane Smith. Marys opinions of her human form seemed to be mixed: she disliked watching people talk using conventional speech; which was considered archaic on her home world, but she said she liked the body which she found so soft, so wicked. She also expressed a dim view of human nature, considering humans to be a race who inherently desired to invade others.A letter to Who Magazine noted Marys strong resemblance to Destrii, a companion from the magazines Doctor comic strips. The magazines editors concurred with the observation.() Later, The Torchwood Archives by Russell specified that Destrii and Mary are from the same system. Destriis home planet Oblivion along with Devos, Krant and Arcateen IV, V and VI form the Arcan system.()Butterfly Person or ArcateenianFile:Butterfly Person.jpg|150px|thumb|A Butterfly Person says goodbye to Jane Smith.Jackson witnessed Jane Smiths encounter with a star poet from Arcateen V in of the Bane. This alien gave Sarah Jane a device with which to summon her whenever Sarah Jane needed help with poetry. The same device was later used by Luke Smith to defeat the Bane. Another member of the same species, dubbed Mary, was seen in the Torchwood episode Greeks Bearing Gifts. While Torchwood showed that the race uses pendants to communicate telepathically and that they possess superior strength, speed, senses and the ability to possess humans and shapeshift, Invasion of the Bane also showed they have the ability to fly. Its assumed that most of this race are benevolent, and that Mary, the first of them to have been seen in any series related to Who, was a criminal and an outcast.Mr Smiths Alien Files on the official website described the race as Butterfly People,( although the Torchwood website uses the term Arcateenian. They are also referenced in the Torchwood spin-off novel in the Water, where they are also called Arcateenians. The Torchwood website also claims that Henry Parker from the episode Day in the Death possessed a full-length Arcateenian translation of The Fog by Herbert, which Includes the foreword from the later edition. Extensively footnoted, largely to explain planet-specific references.(BBC - Torchwood - Episodes / Episode 8 / A Day in the Death - Report) This implies that they are, at least in an academic capacity, familiar with Earth culture. Like all spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series remains unclear.CCanisianThe Canisians are a humanoid war-like race which hail from the planet Alpha Canis One. They were led by the renegade Lord, General Tannis. They first appeared in the story Comes to Time.CarrioniteThe Carrionites, as seen in Shakespeare Code, are a race of witch-like beings. The species originates from the Fourteen Stars of the Rexel Planetary Configuration. They use advanced science which appears much like magic and voodoo. The Carrionites use words to manipulate the universe and defy physics. They possess the ability to discover a persons true name; however, when attempting to name the Doctor, the Carrionite Lilith remarked there is no name, but then mentioned Roses name, apparently sensing his connection to her. In the old times of the universe, they were banished through powerful words by the Eternals.The three Carrionites shown in Shakespeare Code were Lilith, Mother Doomfinger and Mother Bloodtide. They are defeated by Shakespeare with the help of the Doctor and Martha, who helped him find the right words to defeat the Carrionites, ending with expelliarmus. The Carrionites were re-trapped in a crystal ball by this. According to Lilith, Shakespeare accidentally released Doomfinger, Bloodtide and Lilith while he was distraught over his son Hamnets death from the Black Plague.According to the audio commentary of the third season of Doctor Who, Carrionites are all female and call each other mother or sister according to their relative ages. In the novel Forever Autumn, it is revealed that they were banished for warring with a similar race, the Hervoken, who also used a science resembling magic.Cash CowA gigantic space whale featured in the episode Meat. The creature fell through the Rift, into the sea, and beached itself. In its helpless state, it was found and stored in a warehouse where it was then cut up and turned into meat to be sold to food companies. When cut up, as well as exhibiting the ability to regenerate, it also showed a visible increase in size with each regeneration. When Torchwood infiltrate the warehouse with the aim of freeing the creature, the scientists forget to inject it with sedative, causing it to flail about wildly, breaking free from its bonds. This leads Owen to ultimately inject the whale with poison, killing it out of mercy.CastrovalvanCatKindThe CatKind are felines in the future that have evolved into humanoids. They are capable of interbreeding with the humans of the future. The CatKind have hair-covered bodies, feline facial features and retractable claws. Their young resemble typical domestic kittens, with humanoid features emerging after ten months.( )In Earth, a group of The CatKind called the Sisters of Plenitude ran a hospital near the city of New New York. In Gridlock, a Cat Person, Thomas Kincade Brannigan, has a human wife and a litter of kittens.CaxtaridsThe Caxtarids are humanoids with metallic red hair and eyes, who appear in the New Adventures novels of the Living Dad and Room with No Doors, both by Orman. They come from the star system 21185, and are expert torturers. Amongst the planets they have conquered is Kapteyn 5, home of more than sixty sentient species including avians and butterfly-people.The Caxtarids were wiped out by a virus that destroyed DNA. This was created by the government to be used against the rebels. The Doctor attempted to prevent its use, but it was activated ten years after his involvement, during another rebellion.A green-eyed Lalandian, who says she is a different caste from the Caxtarids, appears in the Doctor Adventures novel I, by Orman and Blum. The same book states that the Caxtarids (or Ke Caxtari) do not deal in weapons, but do trade in people.Cell 114Cell 114, their official designation, are a race of invasionary aliens. The arm of Cell 114 featured in the episode Sleeper are Sleeper Agents, an advance guard to the main force. The Sleeper Agents are tasked with gathering intelligence. To do so, they hide on their target planet, take on the form of the planets dominant species, and absorb as much knowledge as they can to aid in the invasion. Sleeper Agents can be stationed in excess of 10 years to aid their integration into society.()To aid their hiding, they are provided with an implant able to gather information subconsciously and protect them against potential attacks. In the case of Earth, the implant is hidden in the arm of the human shell. It provides a blade weapon for use in emergencies, an impenetrable nano-metre thick body shield and a technology mask allowing vital signs to be hidden. When the Sleeper Agents first arrive, their memory is erased and stored in part of the implant to help them maintain their disguise. When the invasion is ready to take place, their memories are reactivated, overriding their human personalities and motivations.In Sleeper, the Sleeper Agents are planning to hijack 10 nuclear bombs with the aim of devastating the planet and making it easy for their race to take over.At the end of Sleeper the last Sleeper Agent left alive is asked by Jack when the others are getting to Earth; the dying Agent replies: Theyre already here.ChameleonCheetah PeopleThe Cheetah People were a group of aliens featured in the final episode of Doctor Whos original run, Survival. Like many more recent aliens, such as the Judoon and Hath, the Cheetah People strongly resembled a real animal, cheetahs. The Cheetah People were depicted as savages and had the ability to turn others into Cheetah People, including for a while the Master and Ace. The Cheetah People in Survival had been kidnapping people and taking them to their planet.In the 1996 Doctor Who film that followed the episode, it was implied by his glowing eyes that the Master retained some of the Cheetah Peoples influence.ChelonianThe Chelonians are a race of cybernetic humanoid tortoises who have appeared in various spin-off novels. The first appearance of the Chelonians was in the Doctor New Adventures novel Highest Science by Gareth Roberts. They returned in Zamper and also featured in the Doctor missing adventure Well-Mannered War; as well as in the short stories The Hungry Bomb, Fegovy, and The Body Bank, all by Gareth Roberts and published in the Who Magazine Yearbook 1995, the anthology Decalog 3: Consequences, and the Doctor Who Storybook 2008 respectively. They are also mentioned in the New Adventures books No It Isnt! and Beyond the Sun featuring Bernice Summerfield.The Chelonians are a war-like race from the planet Chelonia. They are hermaphroditic and lay eggs. Some of their cybernetic enhancements include vision and improved hearing. Chelonians consider humans to be parasites and often try to eliminate them. There is a pacifistic faction, however, and at some point following the Doctors recorded encounters with them, they took control and the society began devoting its energies towards flower arrangement. River Song listed the Chelonians amongst the races with fleets orbiting Earth in Pandorica Opens.ChimeraThe Chimera is a creature that features in the comic The Legacy of Torchwood One!. It is a regular human spliced with the DNA of an alien in an attempt to make a hybrid DNA supersoldier for the British Forces to use in the on terror. The being became uncontrollable and escaped, determined on tracking down its creator, Rupert Howarth. The Chimera can smell fear and uses this ability to track down its victims. It increases its victims fear by appearing to them as what they fear most. It is defeated by a special cocktail of drugs, hidden on the Torchwood mainframe.ChimeronChronovoreChulaChula are described in Empty Child/Doctor Dances two-parter as a race of aliens using nanogenes to heal their soldiers in war. Following Captain Jacks theft of a Chula medical ship, thousands of Blitz-era Londoners were converted incorrectly. Jacks ship was also a Chula war ship.Communication fieldA telecommunications field also known as The Light appears in the audiobook Says Hello. It is not to be confused with The Light which appear in Twilight Streets. Like all Torchwood spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.Cowled ghostsThree cowled ghosts appear in the episode Exit Wounds. The ghosts despise humanitys worship of heathen gods and carry large scythes. Despite being described as ghosts, they are completely pervious to bullets and are all three killed by Ianto and Tosh. Their leader is played by Paul Marc Davies, who portrayed the cowled Trickster in Sarah Jane Adventures and the Chieftain of the Futurekind in the 2007 Doctor Who episode Utopia.CrespallionsCrespallions are a blue-skinned humanoid alien race from the planet Crespallion. They were seen in End of the World working on Platform One.CryonCyber-ControllerThe Cyber-Controller was Lumic (the creator of the Cybermen) after being upgraded himself.CyberkingThe Cyberking is a dreadnought class ship with powerful weapons attached to each arm as well as a cyber factory in the chest cavity. It was first seen in The Next Doctor where it intended to convert Victorian London and then the Earth. In and Stone, it was revealed that the Cyberking fell through a crack in time due to the lack of any evidence of the Victorian London attack.CybermanThe Cybermen were originally a race of humanoids originating on Earths twin planet Mondas. As they implanted more and more artificial parts into their bodies, as a means of self-preservation, they became coldly logical and calculating, with emotion all but deleted from their minds. The Cybermen also have a rivalry with the Daleks.In of the Cybermen/Age of Steel of the second revived series, the Cybermen originated from a parallel version of Earth and were created by Lumic, a genius obsessed with immortality. He forcibly upgraded everyone in the parallel earth.They were created by Dr. Pedler (the unofficial scientific advisor to the programme) and Gerry Davis in 1966, first appearing in the serial Tenth Planet. They have since been featured numerous times in their efforts to conquer and convert humanity to cyborgs like themselves.CybermatsCybershadesCydershades were upgraded animals that served as slaves of the Cybermen.CyberwomanDDalek HumansThe Dalek Human race were created by the Cult of Skaro in New York in the year 1930 in of the Daleks. They were human bodies, with Dalek minds inside. The Cult was relying on a gamma strike from the sun to release the energy needed to splice the human and Dalek genomes together. However, Sec, with the Doctors help, wanted to change the process to give them emotions. The other members of the Cult of Skaro believed that Sec was no longer a true Dalek and turned on him. The Doctor held onto the spire of the State Building as the gamma strike occurred, resulting in his Time Lord DNA mixing with the Dalek Humans DNA, giving the Dalek Humans the potential for free will. Dalek Caan deemed the experiment a failure, and put all of the Dalek Humans to death.DalekDalsThe original name for the Daleks.Data GhostA data ghost is an echo of a dead humans last few moments alive. Data ghosts are the result of an imprint of a persons consciousness at the moment of their death, stored on a neural relay incorporated in Commander Lux suits. In in the Library, Data Ghosts appear at the death of Miss Evangelista and Proper Dave. Data Ghosts typically only last up to a few minutes. The Data Ghost of Miss Evangelista was saved onto the Librarys hard-drive as a result of mixed wireless signals. As a result of corruption, the version of Miss Evangelista saved in the librarys computer appeared deformed and possessed superior intelligence. Later in the episode, the Doctor preserves River Songs consciousness using his sonic screwdriver.DavrosDeathA being described only as Death appears in the episode Dead Man Walking. An entity connected to the second Resurrection Gauntlet, it manifests by using Harper as a host after Harkness brings him back to life. A strange energy the Torchwood team is unable to explain gradually overtakes him before releasing itself and taking a physical form: a skeleton shrouded in black vapour. Death then proceeds to undertake a cycle it had attempted once before in the ages when a young girl, Faith, was resurrected by the glove and brought Death into the world in a similar fashion. If Death can kill 13 people, it will walk the world forever, taking victims at random to feed its rapacious hunger. However, before it can reach its 13th victim, the already-dead Owen stalls Death for long enough that it weakens and dissipates: the same way in which Faith defeated Death in the Middle Ages. Owen then re-absorbs the energy so that he may continue living in his undead state.Death was first mentioned as something in the darkness by Suzie Costello in Keep Killing Suzie.Delta MagnanDemonDemons have appeared in Doctor Who several times. Originally in Doctor serial Dmons, in which they were specifically aliens from the planet Dmos who had come to Earth in the distant past and ingrained their existence as myth, with demon Azal summoned at the Masters will.In 2006, both the Doctor series of Doctor Who and its spin-off Torchwood expanded upon a notion of actual malicious supernatural entities existing in the Doctor Who universe. Impossible Planet introduced the Beast, a Satan-like demon remaining from the universe before our own, sealed in planet Krop Tor by the Disciples of Light. Later, in the Torchwood episode End of Days, the mysterious Bilis Manger frees Abaddon, son of the great Beast from within the Rift, where he, like the Beast, had been imprisoned since before time.Earlier in the first series of Torchwood, demonic supernatural entities, referred to by humans as fairies, were established in Small Worlds as a non-alien presence on Earth since before mankind came to exist.DestroyerDidonianDogonThe Dogon are an extraterrestrial species referred to in Shoes. They are a reptilian race with thirteen eyes, each of which grants them especially enhanced perceptions in various respects; the sixth of which is swallowed by Eugene Jones in Random Shoes and after being fatally hit by a car he is able to return as a ghost to look over his life with a fresh perspective. A few years prior to these events a Dogon ship crashed in the Humber and Dogons were subsequently dissected and investigated by Dr. Rajesh Singh under director Yvonne Hartman.A Dogon Eye was mentioned as having been purchased by Henry Parker in Day in the Death.DominatorDoovariThe Doovari are a race of aliens, mentioned on the Torchwood website, who power their spacecraft on sexual energy provided by their incredibly potent crew.()Draconian}DrahvinDrashigDroonThe Droon feature in the novel, Princes. Like all Torchwood spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.The Droon are a species of small extraterrestrial migratory insects, born from pale blue eggs about 2 inches long. Upon arrival, they take up residence in a warm and moist place, most often the sinus passages of humans where they reside in a state. At this point they are relatively harmless, only causing the host mild, cold-like symptoms. Usually, after a few months, the Droon leave of their own accord or die and, during a sneeze, get ejected without the host even knowing.However, occasionally an egg, roughly one in ten, will pupate and begin to advance to the next stage of their life cycle. When a Droon is about to hatch from its egg, it causes sudden elevations in alpha-wave patterns making it easy to judge when a Droon is about to be a threat. When a Droon hatches, it is no longer pale blue, but a dark blue, almost black, insect with long, thin limbs. In this stage of their life, they are more dangerous than their pupal stage.When the Droon are considered dangerous, Torchwood may use their Anti-Droon audio paddle to forcibly extract the Droon from the host.In Border Princes an elderly husband and wife, Mr and Mrs Peeters are infested by the Droon which have to be exterminated before they hatch.DulcianEEknodineThe Eknodines appear in the episode Amys Choice. They are a race of aliens who can inhabit human bodies, keeping them alive for a long time. The Eknodine appear as green eye-stalks that look out of their hosts mouth. The Eknodine attack by breathing a gas upon their victims that turns them to dust.The Eknodine are only seen in the fictional version of Upper Ledworth created by the Dream Lord. However the Doctor recognises them, suggesting they exist in his reality, though entities within dreams ring familiar to the dreamers, as did Mrs. Hammil, along with the entire elderly community of the fictional Upper Ledworth.ElderEntityThe Entity was a gaseous form capable of eating the whole of time and space. In an attempt to stop it, the Doctor had imprisoned it in a vase which he kept in the TARDISs Drawing Room. Amy accidentally broke the vase and released it, and it consequently attempted to devour her. The Doctor warned that he would contain it once again if it did not release her; after it obliged, he let it out into space to feed on Chronomites, tiny krill-like creatures that, after being killed, will rewind and regenerate to the moment before they were killed. This allows the Entity to feed harmlessly for eternity.EternalEveEve is a child from an unknown race of aliens most of whom were destroyed during the Time War. She is humanoid, with pointed ears and red skin, eyes and hair. Eves race can read timelines and manipulate time and have the ability to possess and control humans. In Mad Woman in the Attic, Eve was evacuated to Earth by her parents when their race was destroyed by the Daleks. Her sentient ship, Ship, crashed on a beach at Danemouth, where it ordered Harry, a funfair caretaker, to keep Eve away from civilisation for her to play games until Ship rebooted.ExxilonFFairiesCalled fairies by mankind, Harkness notes that these creatures do not actually have a name. Fairies are not alien life-forms, but have lived alongside humanity since the dawn of time, and although mankind has ascribed positive, friendly aspects to them, Jack insists that they are dangerous. Their exact nature is unclear, although Jack vaguely describes them as part myth, part spirit world and part reality jumbled together, mixed with old moments and emotions, all moving backwards and forwards through time and seen only out of the corner of ones eye.Fairies and children are linked, and Jack says that fairies were once children, taken from various time periods stretching millennia into the past. These children are the Chosen Ones, who the fairies protect and avenge if harm comes to them, until the time that they claim the children for their own. The fairies require these children in order to continue their races existence.In Small Worlds, fairies are seen in two forms: one a small, glowing humanoid form with butterfly-like wings and the other a much larger, more monstrous form. They are also undetectable by technology, and can appear and disappear at will. They also have control of the elements, able to create sudden gales or rainstorms and direct them with pinpoint accuracy. It is also said that they can make great storms, wild seas, and turn the world to ice.A common method of killing their victims is to steal their breath, asphyxiating them by clogging their throats with rose petals. Their ability to move back and forth in time is demonstrated by the appearance of Jasmine, a Chosen One taken in the present, in fairy form in a 1917 photograph.Jack speculates that fairies may be part Mara. However, his noting of Mara as the origin of the word nightmare and their ability to steal the breath from their victims suggests that he is referring to the Mara of Germanic/Scandinavian mythology. It is unclear whether any reference was intended to the Mara of the Who stories Snakedance and Kinda. Bailey, writer of Snakedance and Kinda, was a practising Buddhist and named Doctor Whos Mara after the Buddhist demon Mara.()Throughout Torchwood Declassified, they are referred to interchangeably as maras, shades and fairies.() In the Torchwood websites Alien Autopsy featurette, they are described as demonic fairies.(BBC - Torchwood - Torchwood Declassified - Autopsy Room )Fish PeopleFlesh:Not to be confused with GangersThe Flesh were a group of human clones used by the Sisters of Plenitude for the development of cures for the people of New Earth. They were initially seen incarcerated in pods, but after their release by Cassandra, they began infecting patients in the hospital. Cured of their diseases by the Doctor, they were established as a new form of humanity.FoamasiThe Foamasi are an intelligent, bipedal race of reptiles resembling humanoid chameleons who appeared in the 1980 Doctor story Leisure Hive by David Fisher. The races name is a near-anagram of the word mafioso. The Foamasi fought and won a 20-minute nuclear war with the Argolin. They communicate by means of chirps and clicks, translated by an interpreting device held in the mouth. Although they became mostly a peaceful race from having learned the error of their ways from the devastating war, a renegade faction called the West Lodge exists and frequently attempted to arouse hostilities between the two races.After their victory, the Argolins home planet of Argolis was officially owned by the Foamasi government. Two saboteurs from the West Lodge tried to force the Argolins to sell them the Leisure Hive, so they could use it as a new base. They were thwarted by a group of Foamasi, one claiming to be a member of the Foamasi government, who used a web-spewing gun to ensnare them and return them to their home planet. Some Foamasi disguise themselves as humanoids by fitting into skin-suits which are smaller than the Foamasis own bodies.A Foamasi assassin appears in the Doctor Adventures novel Placebo Effect by Russell. In this novel, it is explained that the Foamasi can fit into disguises smaller than their bodies because their bones are hollow and collapsible.Forest of CheemThe Forest of Cheem is a race of sentient, bipedal trees that are direct descendants of the Old Earth Trees. The trees were sold to the Brotherhood from the Panjassic Asteroid field, who experimented on the trees, and, after hundreds of years the trees grew arms and started walking. Eventually, the entire race of Trees got on their Barkships after they heard the Great Calling, travelling through space for five thousand years. The word cheem means tree in the forests language.(Doctor Who Adventures, Issue 21, 17 -30 Jan 2007) Members of the Forest of Cheem appear in the Doctor episode The End of the World by T Davies. According to the Doctor, they are of huge financial importance due to their land holdings and forests on various planets; and they have roots everywhere.The Forest respect all forms of life, but neither respect nor understand various technologies such as computers. They were aware of the Lords and their fate in the Time War. The Doctor Who Annual 2006 classifies them as one of the higher species who were aware of the course of the Time War and its history-changing effects and also states that they were mortified by the bloodshed.The group of Trees seen on Platform One was led by Jabe Ceth Ceth Jafe (named in Doctor Who: Monsters and Villains), and also included Coffa and Lute. Coffa and Lute appear again in the comic strip story Reunion of Fear in Who - Battles in Time #6.FuturekindThe Futurekind are a barbaric humanoid race with pointed teeth and primitive language skills, who appear in the 2007 episode Utopia, set in the year 100 trillion when the universe is coming to an end. The human survivors describe the Futurekind as what they may become if they do not reach Utopia, though that seems to be just a myth. The Futurekind are aggressive towards normal humans and hunt them for food.GGENIEIn the Books novel Stone Rose, the GENIEs (Genetically Engineered Neural Imagination Engines) are artificial life forms developed by a scientist working in artificial reality. They resemble a cross between a small dragon and a platypus ensconced in a box, and are capable of altering reality and perception according to peoples desires, whether spoken or thought. Lacking free will, they are thus compelled to grant wishes, potentially causing disruption when in the presence of human beings.GangersThe Gangers (a truncation of Doppelgnger) are made from fully programmable material called the Flesh, used to hold the consciousness of a human worker. They were used as a work gang mining aid. After a storm caused them to fully develop personalities (in Jennifers case, fuse with her progenitor), they openly rebelled against their human progenitors on the island. After they were brought to life, they developed unique abilities like being able to stretch out parts of their body, or become a large deadly monster. They could look human with some effort, but really had smooth unnatural skin. The Flesh made a Ganger of the Eleventh Doctor with a Ganger of his companion, Amy Pond, secretly replacing the original, for predominantly the first half of the thirty-second season. A Ganger of her infant, Melody Pond, was used to fool Amy, in Good Man Goes to War.GarmGastropodThe Gastropods, as seen in Twin Dilemma are a race of giant slugs who kidnapped two maths geniuses to pilot their planet into a sun, creating an explosion that will scatter their eggs across the universe.GaztakGee-Jee FlyAn insect native to the planet Varos.Gel GuardGelthThe Gelth appeared in the Doctor episode Unquiet Dead. They were a new race of alien villains that the Doctor and Tyler encountered in the 2005 series. They were the first element of the new series that attracted attention for being too scary. Following complaints, many of which were made by UK, the BBC stated that in future, episodes of that nature would be forewarned by a statement of may not be suitable for under 8s.The Gelth are blue gaseous life-forms. They claimed to have lost their corporeal forms as a consequence of the Time War, though later actions by the Gelth put the truth of this statement in doubt. They arrived on Earth via the spacetime rift at an undertakers house in Cardiff in 1869. Their forms could not be maintained in Earths atmosphere without suspension in a gaseous medium. They proceeded to take possession of recently deceased corpses and in gas pipes common to era households. When they are possessing these corpses, they look close to being ordinary humans (provided that the corpse has yet to enter the autolytic stage of decomposition), with only two fundamental differences: their irises vanish or turn white, and blue veins are clearly visible on their ghastly pale skin. Gelth make an unearthly shrieking noise for an unknown reason, particularly when theyve possessed someone.Claiming to be on the verge of extinction, the Gelth convinced the Doctor to aid their entrance to Earth via Gwyneth, the undertakers servant girl who had developed psychic powers due to growing up near the rift. The Gelth actually numbered in the billions and intended to take the Earth by force, and to use its murdered population as vessels for themselves. The Gelth were thwarted when Gwyneth sacrificed herself, blowing up the building and sealing the rift. Whether all the Gelth that came through the rift perished is unclear.In of Ghosts, Rose asked whether ghostshifting Cybermen might have been Gelth, which the Doctor stated was not the case.Giant MaggotGiant Spider of Metebelis 3GondGorgonGorgons are a parasitic race that resemble ethereal snakes, based on the mythological Gorgon. In of the Gorgon, three members of this species visited Earth through a portal that was opened by a specific talisman. Once there, they remained on the planet for three thousand years, following the loss of the talisman. In order to remain hidden, they formed a sisterhood of nuns that protected them from the human world. Two members of their kind were slain, one by a Greek hero and another by Professor Edgar Nelson-Stanley and his wife, Bea. A single Gorgon remained to look for the talisman, which Bea gave to Luke Smith, who in turn gave it to his adoptive mother Jane Smith.Gorgons inhabit other species and move to successive hosts as each grows weak and dies in order for them to survive. Gorgons attack by means of a process resembling rapid fossilisation, which gives the appearance that the victim has been turned to stone. The Gorgons are native to the planet Gorgos, 100 million light years from Earth.GraskeA Graske is a member of a race of diminutive aliens from the planet Griffoth. They are able to transmat through time and space, abducting individuals out of their own time and replacing them with their own kind in disguise as their victims. A disguised Graske can be identified by an occasional green glow in its eyes.An unnamed Graske appears in the interactive Doctor Who episode of the Graske and the Proms special episode Music of the Spheres.Krislok is a Graske who first appeared in Sarah Jane Adventures episodes Happened to Sarah Jane? and Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith. He became a servant of the Trickster after it saved him from dying, but later gained his freedom.A Graske makes a cameo appearance in an alien bar in End of Time.Great VampireThe Great Vampire is one of the many Vampire lords. It is the last of its kind, the rest of them having been killed by being shot with large metal spears launched by spacegoing warships known as bowships. The Doctor killed the last one with one of the scoutships from the lords tower, actually a grounded space vessel.GroskeGroske look like Graske but are blue. They first appeared in of the Doctor, where they were seen working for UNIT. One of the Groske later saves Clyde, Rani and Santiago. They also talk like the Graske.Groske can detect artron energy (claiming it smells), and dislike the Graske.GuardianHHaemo-gothIn Pandorica Opens, Haemo-goths are the only creatures gathered at Stonehenge, mentioned by River Song, which did not appear in any previous written or television adventure of the Doctor.HaemovoreHaemovores appeared in the Doctor story Curse of Fenric by Briggs. Vampiric creatures that fed on blood, they were the end result of human evolution in a possible far future, caused by millennia of pollution. As part of his final game against the Doctor, the entity known as Fenric transported the most powerful Haemovore, called the Ancient One, through time to Age Northumbria. There it waited, trapped beneath the Sea for centuries, occasionally drawing victims into the water and transforming them into Haemovores.Soon after the transformation, victims appeared much as they did in life, except for elongated fingernails and a corpse-like pallor. Later they became deformed blue-grey humanoids covered in octopus-like suckers. The Ancient One was the least human in appearance; in its own time, it was the last living thing on Earth.During War II, Fenric released the Ancient One. Fenrics plan was that the Ancient One was to release the toxin which would pollute the world and thus create its own future.The Haemovores had the ability to hypnotically paralyse their victims so they could feed and drain them of blood. Not all of their victims were turned into Haemovores, although the selection process was never explained. The Haemovores were impervious to most forms of attack, surviving being shot at close range by a gun at one point. They could be destroyed in the traditional vampire-killing fashion of driving a stake through their chests. They could also be repelled by their victims faith, which formed a psychic barrier, like the Doctors faith in his companions, Aces faith in the Doctor, Captain Sorins faith in the Revolution, and even the Reverend Wainwrights failing faith in God.Ultimately, the Seventh Doctor convinced the Ancient One to turn against Fenric, and it released the toxin within a sealed chamber, destroying itself and Fenrics host. Whether this means that the future the Ancient One came from was averted is not clear, although the Doctor seemed to think so.HandbotsThe Handbots were programmed to help the citizens of Apalapucia with their kindness. Their medicine however would kill any aliens from the outside world. Should the patient refuse to be injected with medicine, the Handbots would crack open their blank faces to shoot out a needle. If the patient dodges the needle, other Handbots then were teleported to help inject the patient. In Girl Who Waited, the TARDIS landed on the planet Apalapucia who was under quarantine due to the outbreak of Chen7, a virus that can kill anyone with two hearts within a day, specifically Apalapucians and the Doctor himself. Pond, who was under quarantine, was chased by the Handbots who tried to give her their kindness.HathAliens that appear as tall, roughly humanoid creatures with fish-like heads, who can breathe in air via the employment of apparatus fitted to their faces that incorporates a canister of green liquid. They are intelligent, emotional creatures  one formed a friendship with Jones, and saved her life at the cost of its own. They seem sentient and while they do not speak a language intelligible to humans, the two races planned to colonize the planet Messaline together. However, they later turned on each other  before their eventual reconciliation, thanks to the Doctors intervention.The Monster Files feature states that the Hath joined and assisted early human space colonisation.(, The Monster Files)The Hath returned for a cameo appearance in the second part of End of Time, where they are seen in an alien bar, and they are seen briefly in The Eleventh Hour in a clip illustrating the Doctors role as protector of the Earth, suggesting that they have visited the planet at some point prior to 2010.HitchhikerA parasitic alien which resides in a human host. Hitchhikers are harmless and may release endorphins into the blood, creating a sensation of euphoria in their hosts.HoixA Hoix features in the episode Exit Wounds; the first time its name has been mentioned on screen, having previously been seen in the Doctor Who episode & Monsters two years before. Owen distracts it by feeding it cigarettes stating that it lives to eat.A Hoix was also mentioned in the novel Twilight Streets.Hop PyleenBrothers from the exalted clifftops of Rex Vox Jax who invented and are copyright holders of Hyposlip Travel Systems. They were guests aboard Platform One to see the Earthdeath spectacle.HordaCarnivorous creatures that crawl on the ground of Leelas World.Heavenly HostKiller androids that resemble Christmas Angels. They are most notably seen in Voyage of the Damned but have also had roles in other serials leading up to Voyage.IIce WarriorInvincible VampireThe so-called Invincible Vampire is listed by Owen Harper on the Torchwood website as being among the people and creatures cryopreserved at Torchwood Three. The specimen reconstitutes itself when dusted; freezing is the only way to stop it.()IsolusThe Isolus is an alien species, a tiny spore-like creature which travels through space, first appearing in the 2006 episode Her. In that episode, one of them was separated from the swarm and the creature wound up on Earth, inhabiting a young English girl named Chloe Webber. The Isolus was confused by Chloes fears of her father and, acting through her, trapped neighbourhood children in Chloes pencil drawings. The Isolus released Chloe when the Doctor showed it the love the human race could produce in the events just before the Summer Olympics. An Isolus is a creature of intense emotion and its sheer need to be together that keeps them alive. In their featuring episode, the Doctor states that, on average, they have a family the size of around 4 billion.JJacondanJagarothThe Jagaroth are an ancient and extinct race of aliens introduced in the Doctor serial of Death. The Doctor remarked that the Jagaroth were a vicious, callous, warlike race whom the universe wont miss. The story reveals that life on Earth moved from being acids in a soup to functioning cells because a Jagaroth space ship exploded on earth 400 million years ago. (Due to an error by production, it should have been 4,000 million years, or 4 billion years ago.)The sole surviving Jagaroth, Scaroth, manipulated human civilisation to advance the species technologically, in an effort to eventually create a time machine which he could use to prevent the initial explosion.JagrafessThe Jagrafess was a large, slimy, creature that attached itself to the ceiling of floor 500 on Satellite Five. It wanted to control the Earth through the use of a news station. The Jagrafess could not survive in extreme heat and was killed after one of the reporters purposely channelled the heat towards floor 500. It had a human servant called the Editor, who called it Max after its full title: the Mighty Jagrafess of the Holy Hadrojassic Maxarodenfoe.JixenJixen are a race of turtle-like warriors which first appeared in the K9 episode Regeneration. They are in a war against the Merons which has gone for centuries across the galaxy. They are able to use sonar type movement that makes them look like theyre shuddering and can emit a sonic wave when they use their high pitched battle cry which renders their enemies defenceless.(K9 Official - Monsters - www.k9official.com)JudoonThe Judoon are galactic alien police resembling rhinoceroses that work for the Shadow Proclamation. They appeared in the series 3 story, of the Judoon, in pursuit of a Veil life form known as Androvax that escaped from a crashed Judoon prison transport. They have relatively low intelligence levels but possess sophisticated technology such as H2O Scoops that are capable of lifting large buildings and Thermal Guns that are able to disintergrate targets.The Judoon first appeared as a major alien in the Doctor Who episode, and Jones as well as the episodes Stolen Earth.KKVIThe KVI are a Russian organisation who feature in the novel Trace Memory. In Russian, KVI stands for Komitet Vnezemnih Issledovanij, or The Committee For Extraterrestrial Research. The chapters in which they feature are set in 1967.KaledThe Dalek were originally Kaled, from the planet Skaro.KarfelonKastrianKindaKorvenThe Korven were green-skinned humanoids with large, wing-like ears, two horns on their heads and four horns on their chin. They were adapted to cold temperatures. The colour of their eyes seemed to change continually. They were usually dark grey, but could change to light grey or red. Each eye could be a different colour. Theyre first appearance was Korven.KraalKrafayisA griffin-like creature that could only be seen by van Gogh in and the Doctor, the Krafayis was rendered blind by unknown means and as a result was abandoned by its own kind. Acting out of loneliness and fear, it lashed out and attacked people before being finally subdued by Vincent with help from the Doctor and Amy. This creature is based on a book written by the Lords as the doctor remembers, when Vincent draws a picture of the beast, that he himself had read the story when he was younger.KrillitaneThe Krillitanes are an alien race that first appeared in the episode School Reunion. They had infiltrated the Deffry Vale school on present day Earth, increasing the intelligence of the pupils with Krillitane oil. Using the children as part of a giant computer program, they hoped to crack the secrets of the Skasis Paradigm, the Universal Theory that would give them control over the basic forces of the universe and turn them into gods. Their scheme was foiled by the Doctor and his companions, though not before they attempted to ask the Doctor to join them in remaking the universe.The Krillitanes are a composite race who pick and choose physical traits they find useful from the species they conquer, incorporating them into their own bodies. When the Doctor last encountered them they looked like humans with very long necks, but by the time of School Reunion, they possessed a bat-like form which they obtained from the conquest of Bessan ten generations prior. However, they were able to maintain a morphic illusion of human form, which could be discarded if needed.A side effect of their rapid evolution made the very oil they were using to enhance the intelligence of Deffry Vales children toxic to their own systems, reacting with them like an acid. As bat creatures, they sleep in a way similar to Earth bats, hanging from a ceiling with wings covering their bodies. Like Earth bats, they are sensitive to loud or high frequency noises, as demonstrated when they were temporarily disabled by the schools fire alarm. They are also carnivorous and have no qualms in devouring other sentient life-forms for food.KrollA giant squid that has been mutated and enlarged due to ingesting one of the pieces of the Key To Time. The green-skinned citizens of the planet worship Kroll as a god.KrotonKrynoidThe Krynoids appeared in the Doctor story Seeds of Doom by Banks Stewart. They are a highly dangerous, sentient form of plant life which are renowned amongst galactic botanists. They spread via seed pods which travel in pairs and are violently hurled through space by frequent volcanic eruptions on their unnamed home planet. The pods when opened are attracted to flesh and are able to infect and mingle their DNA with that of the host, taking over their body and slowly transforming them into a Krynoid. The species can also exert a form of telepathic control over other plant life in the surrounding area, making it suddenly dangerous and deadly to animal-kind. In the later stages of development the Krynoid can also control the vocal cords of its victims and can make itself telepathically sympathetic to humans. Fully grown Krynoids are many meters high and can then release hordes of seed pairs for further colonisation.Two pods arrived on Earth at the South Pole during the prehistoric Pleistocene era and remained dormant in Antarctica until discovered at the end of the twentieth century. One of them hatched after being exposed to ultra-violet light, and took control of a nearby human scientist. The Doctor intervened in the nick of time and ensured the Krynoid was destroyed in a bomb, but the second pod was stolen and taken to the home of millionaire botanist Harrison Chase in England. Chase ensured the germination of the second pod, which overtook his scientific adviser Arnold Keeler, and transformed its subject over time into a virtually full-sized Krynoid. Unable to destroy the creature by other means, and with the danger of a seed release imminent from the massive plant, the Doctor orchestrated an RAF bombing raid to destroy the creature before it could germinate.The Krynoid are also featured in the Doctor audio story for Big Finish entitled Hothouse.Also featured in BBV audios The Root of all Evil, and The Green Man.LLakertyanLampreyLogopolitanThe Logopolitans of the planet Logopolis were featured in the episode of the same name. The Logopolitans were a race of strange looking mathematicians concerned with entropy to make sure death of the universe did not occur. This was disturbed by the Master and the Logopolitons were killed, although the universe was saved.LukoserLurmanMMacraThe Macra first appear in the 1967 Doctor story Macra Terror by Stuart Black. They are an intelligent, giant crab-like species from an unnamed planet colonised by humanity in the future. The Macra invade the control centre of the colony and seize the levers of power without the colonists  including their Pilot  knowing what had happened. Thereafter the Macra only appear at night, when the humans are in their quarters, observing a curfew. They have strong hypnotic powers which alter human perception. They also have the ability to ensure messages are vocalised through electronic apparatus such as television or sensor speakers. Both these tools are used to keep the human colonists under control, believing they are blissfully happy. This provides a cover for the Macra to use the colonists as miners in a vast gas mine. The gas is deadly to the miners but vital to the Macra, enabling them to move more quickly and rejuvenating their abilities. The Doctor effects a revolution on the Macra planet and helps engineer an explosion in the control centre, destroying the Macra in charge.The Macra are also featured in the 2007 episode Gridlock, becoming the only one-off opponent of the Doctor in the classic series to appear in the revived series so far. In the episode, some Macra are found to be alive below New New York, a city of New Earth. They live in the thick fog of exhaust gases on the main motorway under the city, tracking the flying cars by their lights and snatching at them when they get too close. The Doctor says that the species is billions of years old and once developed a small empire as the scourge of this galaxy, but the Macra beneath New New York must have devolved into nothing more than beasts. The status of the Macra beyond Gridlock is yet to be seen.MalmoothThe Malmooth are a race of humanoid insectoids native to the planet Malcassairo, who are all but extinct by the year one hundred trillion. The last surviving member of their race, Chantho, played by Chung, appears in Utopia. A devoted assistant to Professor Yana for seventeen years, when the Professor is revealed to be the Master and proceeds to turn on the Doctor and his companions, Chantho threatens to kill him. He electrocutes her, but she manages to shoot him before dying, forcing him to regenerate.A feature of Chanthos speech is that she starts with chan and ends her sentences with tho. She considers it rude to do otherwise, tantamount to swearing.Physical features of the Malmooth include an insectoid exoskeleton and mandibles, and the ability to survive by drinking their own internal milk.The Eighth Doctor encountered another of the Malmooth during a flashback sequence in IDWs Doctor Who: The Forgotten issue 5.Mandragora HelixMandrelMaraMarshmanMarshspiderThe MasterThe Master was the Doctors old friend, but they soon became enemies during they became adults. He is portrayed by Simm in 2007 - 2010. He first appeared in Claws of Axos in 1971, but by various different actors during the past times.MayflyThe Mayfly is an insectoid creature seen in the episode Reset. It is used by medical research facility The Pharm, run by Professor Aaron Copley as part of a drug that is capable of resetting a human body suffering from normally fatal diseases to a healthy state. However, it eventually kills the host as it reproduces inside the body; at worst, the mayfly kill each other until only one is left. This grows inside the chest until it bursts out, but all human subjects to date have died before they reach that stage. During Torchwoods investigation of The Pharm, Jones is briefly infested with a mayfly, and is the only person to survive because her travels in the TARDIS have apparently improved her immune system. Owen uses the singularity scalpel to remove the mayfly from her body before it can do so itself. After Ianto and Gwen discover the parent mayflies behind the Pharm, Jack has the entire facility destroyed so that the mayflies can no longer be used, and they are allowed to die in peace.MegaraMegropolisMelkeneThe Melkene, referenced in the novel Princes, are an extinct race of advanced aliens, capable of creating exceptionally lifelike artificials. Like all Torchwood spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series remains unclear.During an interplanetary war with a rival species, the Melkene created a race of robots called the Serial G. These robots reach a height of 14 feet and possess a devastatingly powerful heat ray. The Serial Gs fought back against their creators when the war was over and wiped them out before going to ground across the galaxy. In Border Princes, Mr. Dine of The First Senior attacks and destroys a fully functioning Serial G.Men In BlackMen In Black are androids that first appeared in the Doctor serial Dreamland. In Vault of Secrets, Mister Dread and the Alliance of Shades attempts to incinerate the gang, for they refused to hand over a disc required to enter the Vault of Secrets as well as Androvax, who wanted to revive the last survivors of the Veils. Clyde tricks two Men In Black at one point by jumping away from two incineration blasts both fired at, causing the blasts to destroy each other. The gang were able to get Mister Dread to allow Androvax and his race to leave in their ship without any harm by having him beam them into outer space.MenoptraThe Menoptra (spelled Menoptera in the novelisation of the serial) appeared in the Doctor story Web Planet, by Strutton (1965). They are an intelligent, bipedal insectoid species from the planet Vortis. In appearance, they resemble a cross between giant butterflies and bees, with each Menoptra possessing four large wings. They have yellow and black stripes around their bodies and appear to be around six feet tall, but do not seem to have typical insect body parts (such as mandibles or an abdomen).Peaceful and kindly by nature, the Menoptra move in a unique, stylised way and their vocal inflections are stilted. They were very welcoming of the Doctor, Ian, Barbara, and Vicki; but showed an animosity towards their fellow insectoids, the Zarbi, as well as an abhorrence for the Animus, a hostile alien intelligence that had taken over the originally passive Zarbi and almost all of Vortis. Once it was clear that the Doctor was willing to help them defeat the Animus, they were only too glad to assist in any way they could.The assumption is that once the Animus was defeated, the Menoptra, Zarbi and the rest of the inhabitants of Vortis were able to live together in peace.MentiadMentorThe Mentors are an amphibious race native to the planet Thoros Beta. They have two arms with a large tail in place of their lower limbs, and speak to other species through a translation device worn around their necks. The most notable of the Mentors is Sil, whom the Doctor and Peri encountered first on the planet Varos in on Varos, and then again on Thoros Beta in Mindwarp. Both stories were written by Philip Martin. Other Mentors include Lord Kiv, their leader. Typical Mentor business practice includes arms dealing and slave trading. In Mindwarp, Lord Kiv has his brain transplanted into a primitive Mentor body, which has retained the tail sting that modern Mentors no longer have.Midnight EntityAn unnamed and unseen creature, found on the surface of the planet Midnight, an environment supposedly inimical to all life. Described briefly as a shadow glimpsed running across the landscape, it was encountered in Shuttle Bus 50 in Midnight. It violently boarded and took over the body and mind of Sky Silvestry, repeating the speech patterns of the passengers, influencing them, and then consuming the Doctors voice. The shuttles hostess ultimately sacrificed herself by opening a door and sucking them both out of the bus, where Silvestrys body was presumably vaporised by the deadly Xtonic sunlight. Though its hold on the Doctor and the other passengers was broken, the nature and fate of the creature itself remains uncertain. Disturbingly, even the Doctor had no idea what the creature was.MidomarA diminutive race of aliens mentioned on the Torchwood website.() Around 5 cm high, they travel on waves and can reconstruct themselves using energy from the receiver. They are often found in radios.MinotaurA being that feeds on peoples beliefs. When the Doctor meets it, it is completely taken over by its instincs. It does not want to feed on people but it has no choice. It makes an entire fake hotel with someones fear in each room. The Doctor gives this being space to die when he  cuts off the food supply by stopping Amy from trusting him. When the Minotaur feeds, it makes the person worship it and want to be killed by it.MinyanMire BeastMogarianMona LisaThe Mona Lisa is an alien organism that exists in a mineral that was used in paint supplied by Giuseppe Di Cattivo in the 15th century. da Vinci used the paint for his famous Lisa, and when the picture is brought into proximity with Giuseppes notorious painting of The Abomination - a painting considered too terrifying to be seen - both the pictures come to life in Lisas Revenge. In order to release The Abomination, she forced Clyde to draw a key that she could use to turn the key to reality. The Mona Lisa was successful in doing so, but accidently transforms a previous drawing of K-9 to life as well, who locks The Abomination and return all moving paintings to its original positions.MonoidMorestranMorloxMorokMovellanThe Movellans, who made their first and only appearance to date in the Doctor serial of the Daleks, originated from outside the galaxy and were adversaries of the Daleks.The Movellans outwardly resemble physically attractive humans, of various ethnicities and both genders. All of the Movellan androids and gynoids wear white, form-fitting uniforms and wear their hair in silver braids. Being androids, the Movellans are stronger and have more endurance than normal humans. However, the major weakness of the Movellan design is that each androids external power pack, carried on its belt, can be easily removed to completely shut down the android. The power pack circuitry can also be modified, reprogramming the android to obey human orders.They are mentioned again in of the Daleks, as a virus of their invention was central to that storys plot.Moxx of BalhoonOne of the aliens visiting Platform One to witness the destruction of planet Earth.MummyMummies appeared in the Fourth Doctors adventure, of Mars. They were bringing back their leader Sutekh from Mars.MyrkaNNaglonNanogeneNavarinoNesteneThe Nestene are a blob-like aliens who can control all forms of plastic, creating Autons.Night TravellersThe Night Travellers feature in the episode Out of the Rain, portrayed as a travelling circus group in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. They were described as only appearing at night, and out of the rain. This suggests that some kind of H20 Scoop technology may have been used, but since the Night Travellers were humans, this is unlikely. The Night Travellers stole the breaths of their audiences in order to keep a permanent audience, the people themselves vanishing along with the Night Travellers. However, with the rise of cinema in the 20th Century, travelling circuses diminished, including the Night Travellers. Jack Harkness called them an extinct species. However, the Night Travellers survived on old film reels.The certain Night Travellers in particular were of the Joshua Joy Travelling Show, led by the creepy ringmaster called the Ghostmaker, who carried a silver flask with him to store the captured breath of his victims. He was infatuated with Pearl, whom he describes as a living mermaid due to her deep love and connection with water. The two escape from a film reel played in the Electro Cinema in Cardiff, and begin collecting breaths again to rebuild their lost audience. However, this time, the victims are left alive but severely dehydrated. The Ghostmaker and Pearl decide to bring the other travellers back into the world and continue travelling again. Stealing the film from the workshop of Jonathon Penn, the two go to the Electro Cinema and play the footage, bringing their other companions out - a weightlifter, a pair of clowns, a tattooed man and a pair of jugglers who doubled as firebreathers.However, unbeknownst to the Night Travellers, Jack and Ianto Jones record all of them onto a new film strip. Ianto stole the Ghostmakers silver flask and lures him out into the sunlight. Jack exposes the new film strip to sunlight. Exposed to the light, the Night Travellers are all erased from existence. Seconds before his demise, the Ghostmaker opens the silver flask and casts the captured breaths to the air, destroying all but one breath. Despite their defeat, Jack claimed they could return if more footage of them was recorded. This is also hinted in a final scene of the episode in which a father and son buy an old film reel at a car boot sale. The boy drops the reel which opens, a familiar melody of circus music echoing out, which is heard by Jack. The Ghostmaker was portrayed by Bleach who would go on to play Davros in the finale of Season 4 of Who.Nightmare ManThe Nightmare Man is rather not an alien, but rather a trans-dimensional being who had found a way into Lukes mind in The Nightmare Man. He then fed off of Lukes fear and became real, trapping Luke in the dimension human minds travel to when they dream. The Nightmare Man begins to integrate within other peoples mind, including Clyde and Rani, trapping them as well in separate dreams. However, as fear can only be caused by loneliness in his terms, Luke was able to get Clyde and Rani to imagine a door that led to Luke. There, they tricked The Nightmare Man (after getting his attention for they were together) into trapping himself inside the dimension forever. May be related to the emotion-feeding Pied Piper.NimonNostroviteThe Nostrovites feature in the episode Something Borrowed. Jack describes them as carnivorous alien shape-shifters with a taste for human flesh. Nostrovites hunt in pairs and mate for life. They are most notable for their method of reproduction; after fertilisation, the female passes her eggs to the male, who stores them in a protective pouch in the throat, where they can be passed into a suitable host through a bite. The eggs are incubated within the host until they are ready to hatch; the female then tracks down the host and tears them open to free the offspring. Female Nostrovites are also resilient to injury; one survives being shot with two full clips of bullets, while her mate is killed by only a few shots from Gwen the previous night (Although Owen speculated that she was being driven by maternal rage more than anything else). They only appear to attack living prey: the female does not attack Owen when she realises he is dead. The female adapts to pose as a woman in a black dress, Rhyss mother Brenda and Jack, after only brief encounters with the latter two, suggesting at some slight psychic power (The female also attempted to use Gwens attraction to Jack to put her off-guard by posing as him). However, they are unable to imitate smells; Gwen recognises Rhys real mother by her (disgusting) perfume. When they are revealed as Nostrovites, their eyes turn red and their teeth become elongated and grey.OOgriOgronOlympianOlympians (also known as Gods) were a race of tall near-humans from the planet Olympus and one of the most powerful races in the universe. They were responsible for controlling certain parts of the universe and could change certain things at their will. Olympians were immortal and could never die of old age. They could also use powers on a massive scale including controlling the TARDIS by simply emitting electricity at the console and also appear in a gigantic form amongst clouds which they could then unleash massive amounts of power. All Olympians served Zeus although some were known to go on their own will. They were very advanced however some of their methods were primitive. The Olympian Prometheus was the one responsible for starting life in the universe.The Doctor and K9 met them in the story The Life Bringer which they freed Prometheus and travelled to their home planet.OodOpteraThe Optera appeared in the Doctor story Web Planet by Strutton. These caterpillar-like creatures were once Menoptra, but they elected to instead burrow under the ground and abandon the world of light and flight above. It is implied that they may have been driven there by the malevolent Animus.They have larger eyes than their Menoptra brethren, and have no wings. However, they have numerous arms and appear to hop in a stylised way. They speak with inflection different to that of their bee-like cousins, but their speech is a strange dialect of the language of the upper world and words and phrases they have coined for themselves.At the storys end, the Animus is defeated and the Optera are persuaded to return to the surface, where they look forward to their children learning the joys of flight; implying that once back on the surface the Optera will redevelop wings. It is assumed that all of species indigenous to Vortis are now living peacefully together.OsiranThe Osirans were a powerful alien race who were equal to the Lords and much of whose history became encoded in mythology. Sutekh, a renegade who became evil, was one of them. He was pursued across the galaxy by his brother Horus and was finally defeated on Earth by the combined might of 740 Osirans. Sutekh was trapped in a hidden black pyramid in Egypt, held in place by an energy beam transmitted from a pyramid on Mars. Once the beam was disabled, the Doctor managed to travel back to earth before it released Sutekh and using a control from the TARDIS was able to set the end of the transit tunnel millions of years into the future so when it released Sutekh he was dead.Other mediaIn issue #1 of the IDW published Doctor Who comic book, a Sycorax is collecting near-extinct species to use with shape-shifters for expensive hunts. The Sycorax race also make a return in the Doctor comic strip The Widows Curse, in Who Magazine #395. The DWM comic story is the first appearance of female Sycorax, who seem to operate separately from the males.PParasitic alien tapewormsA race of parasitic alien tapeworms feature in the novel Decay.The parasite starts its life as an egg which hatches in the body of a living creature and lives in the intestines, feeding on the hosts food. At a certain age, or when its host is killed, the parasite turns into a winged creature with two sharp ends. It can impale itself into another creature, lay eggs in the corpse, and leave. A scavenger may devour the corpse, and, unwittingly, the parasite eggs, which would hatch and the life cycle continue. The hosts of the parasite feel extreme hunger, gradually grow slimmer and their weakness makes it possible for them to bring down a fully grown Weevil. Rhys eats one of the eggs, thinking that it is a very effective weight loss pill.PelPeg DollsThe peg dolls are simply small dolls that creep out a young boy (really a Tenza) who can put anything he fears in his cupboard, even people. When people are in the dolls house in the cupboard the dolls want to play, and do so by chasing them and turning them into dolls by touch. However, when the boy can face his fears, all the people in the cupboard go back to where they were before, even if they were turned into a doll. (Night Terrors)Pied PiperBased on the mythical piper in the fairytale, the Pied Piper was an energy entity from the Jeggorabax Cluster, home to beings that feed on emotions. The species spacecraft resembled meteorites; one such ship crash landed on Earth in the Weserbergland Mountains, Saxony in 1283. Feeding off the emotion of fear, it assumed the human disguise of Pied Piper and stole away all the children of the town of Hamelin, creating fear from parents.The Doctor, and Gillian first meet the Pied Piper in the comic Challenge of the Piper. This is also the first story to ever feature the Pied Piper in Doctor Who. Over the centuries, the creature continued to abduct children and terrify their parents, using many guises including Odd Bob the Clown, who kidnapped children in wartime New York. In the 2009 story Day of the Clown, posing as both the ringmaster Elijah Spellman and as Odd Bob, the entity established a museum in Ealing named Spellmans Magical Museum of the Circus, made possible by the presence of the Weserbergland Meteorite at the Pharos Institute. Because of Sarah Janes affiliation with Pharos, she broke some of the meteorite and used it to trap the alien in it, after having weakened it by laughing at its clown form instead of fearing it. The meteorite was then sealed in a special emotion-proof container made out of Halconite steel in Sarah Janes attic.Pig slaveIn in Manhattan and of the Daleks (2007), the of Skaro experimented on humans and turned them into Pig Slaves if they possessed a low level of intelligence. Just why the Daleks chose such a form for their slaves is unknown. The Pig Slaves captured subjects for the Dalek experiments, taking them through the sewers of Manhattan to the basement of the State Building. Some pigs hid in the Broadway theatre where the showgirl Tallulah performed. Tallulah later sees her missing boyfriend, Laszlo, but does not immediately recognise him because he has been mutated into a half-pig/half-man form. Laszlo still retains most of his memory and personality since he managed to escape from the Daleks before the process could be completed. He leaves a single white rose for Tallulah in her room each night before her performance and is able to resist the Daleks, unlike the other mutants. True Pig Slaves are extremely aggressive and savage creatures, and according to Laszlo, capable of slitting a throat with their bare teeth. However, they are also vulnerable and have very short lifespans, only surviving a few weeks.The Torchwood Institute website states that 1930s New York suffered an infestation similar to the Weevil infestation of Cardiff in the late 2000s, and that it was covered up by rumours of crocodiles.() This is presumably intended by the websites producers to tie in the New Yorks Pig Slave infestation of Daleks in Manhattan with the stories of the Torchwood universe.PlasmavorePlasmavores are shape-changing aliens that live on haemoglobin. They absorb blood from their victims, which in turn changes their own blood chemistry to that of the victim, allowing them to mimic other species when medically scanned. A Plasmavore was hiding from the Judoon in the Royal Hope Hospital on Earth, disguised as Florence Finnegan.PrimordPrimords were humans mutated by slime produced as a by-product of Project Inferno. The creatures were never actually called Primords in the story, although they were credited as such. In some circumstances, the infection could be transmitted if a Primord touched a human and heat would cause the transformation to progress at a more rapid pace. Primords were resistant to pistol fire, although they could be injured by repeated rifle fire and killed by sudden drops in temperature or in falls. The degree of intelligence displayed by the Primords was variable; they acted primarily on instinct, but displayed signs of organisation and tactics, especially in the early stages. They made a high-pitched, screeching sound, which the Doctor claimed that he had heard during the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, suggesting that he had encountered, or at least heard, the creatures before.Prisoner ZeroPrizoner Zero is a shapeshifting alien resembling an viperfish that hid from the Atraxi in the house of Pond for twelve years in a room she never noticed. In its normal form, it hangs from the ceiling.ProamonPterodactylThe Torchwood Three team keeps a pterodactyl as a pet (specifically, a Pteranodon). It is first seen in Everything Changes, flying inside the Torchwood Hub as well as in the skies over Dahl Plass at the end of the episode. The cast and crew have nicknamed the pterodactyl Myfanwy.() On the Torchwood website, the characters also refer to the pterodactyl by the name Myfanwy.(BBC - Torchwood - Messages) The creature came through the Cardiff spacetime Rift and began eating sheep, only to be captured by Torchwood and subsequently socialized. It is also nocturnal, and is content to come and go at night, with a few sightings which thus far have not caused any concern, except for a few missing sheep in Barry which have been attributed to panthers on the loose,(Torchwood External Hub Interface - Pterodactyl) a reference to cat sightings especially common in West England and Wales.In Cyberwoman it is revealed that the team use a special type of barbecue sauce (the website describes it as a special protein sauce) to help it identify what food is safe for it to eat. While it proved capable of fighting a Cyberman it was not seen again in the first series, leading to the assumption that the Cyberwoman killed it, but this proved not to be the case, as it had a cameo appearance in the 2nd series episode Meat.In flashback scenes in Fragments the Pteranodon is seen again when Ianto joins Torchwood by helping Captain Jack capture it, Jack deciding to keep it as a watchdog.PwccmThe same race as Abaddon, Pwccm features in the novel Twilight Streets as the master of the Dark before his destruction by Abaddon in their final battle.PyrovileThe Pyroviles are a race of aliens which appeared in the episode Fires of Pompeii. With a stone skin held together by living magma, their shape resembles Roman Centurions. One of their ships fell to Earth thousands of years ago, shattering them into dust. The earthquake that caused Vesuvius to erupt in the year 79 re-awakened them, and they possessed human hosts in nearby Pompeii. These hosts helped the few adult Pyroviles who had survived to construct an energy conversion matrix to use lava inside Vesuvius to conquer Earth and power the conversion of the whole human race into adult Pyroviles in order to replace their homeworld of Pyrovilia, which was lost. Throwing water over them is fatal, since it causes their magma to cool. They are also capable of breathing fire; their breath is shown as powerful enough to incinerate a human in seconds. The invading Pyroviles were supposedly destroyed in the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius.In Stolen Earth/Journeys End, it is revealed that Pyrovilia was among the 27 planets snatched into the Medusa Cascade by the New Dalek Empire. After their defeat, all the planets were returned to their rightful places. With the reappearance of their homeworld, there may be hope for any remaining Pyroviles.QRRaakThe Raak was a sea monster experimented on by Crozier in Mindwarp (1986).RacnossThe Racnoss appeared in the Doctor story The Runaway Bride in 2006.The Racnoss were an ancient race of aliens from the Dark Times of the universe. Half-humanoid, half-arachnid in appearance, they were an invasion force who consumed everything on the planets they conquered. Their race was wiped out by the Fledgeling Empires, including the Lords, over 4.6 billion years ago. Nearly all of the survivors of the race escaped in their ship to where the Earth would later form, serving in place of a planetesimal as its core, hibernating for billions of years, with the exception of their Empress. She would later come to Earth in her ship, the Webstar, seeking to use the Huon particles which had been recreated by the Institute as a means of resurrecting her children before feasting on the human population of Earth. The last Racnoss were presumed wiped out when the Doctor drained the waters of the Thames down the shaft leading to their ship; the Empress was killed when her own ship was destroyed by the British army at the order of Saxon.The Empress appears briefly in a flashback in Turn Left. In the parallel universe created by Donna Noble, she has still been defeated, but the Doctor, taking too long to escape without Donnas assistance, was drowned and died with her, the water killing him too quickly for him to regenerate, causing the Earth to become a dystopia over the next few years.RaxacoricofallapatoriansNative to Raxacoricofallapatorius, Raxacoricofallapatorians are grouped by extended family names which are sometimes used to refer to their species generically. They hatch from eggs and are composed of living calcium. Capital punishment is practised on the home world, which involves immersion of convicted criminals in acid that slowly dissolves them while still alive.The Slitheen family are a ruthless criminal sect motivated by profit. Convicted for their crimes on Raxacoricofallapatorius, they face execution if they return.The Blathereen family are sworn enemies of the Slitheen, and have infiltrated the prison on the planet Justicia.(BBC BOOK, The Monsters Inside)A Raxacoricofallapatorian makes a cameo appearance in an alien bar in End of Time.ReaperReapers appeared in the Doctor episode Fathers Day, written by Cornell. Although not named on screen, they were referred to as Reapers in the publicity material for the episode. The production team based their design on the Reaper, with their tails shaped like scythes.Reapers are multi-limbed, flying creatures similar to pterosaurs, with a large wingspan, sharp teeth both in the form of a beak and a secondary mouth in their torsos, coupled with a rapacious attitude. The Reapers are apparently extradimensional, materialising and dematerialising out of the spacetime vortex. They are attracted to temporal paradoxes that damage time, like bacteria swarming around a wound. They then proceed to sterilise the wound by consuming everyone in sight.Once in this dimension, however, they can be blocked by material barriers. The older the barriers, the more effective they are, but even the oldest of barriers cannot stop them forever. Paradoxes can also allow them to directly materialise at the spot of the paradox. If the timeline is restored, they vanish, with their actions reversed as if they had never happened.In Fathers Day, the Doctor explained that when the Lords were still around, there were laws to prevent the spread of paradoxes and that such paradoxes could be repaired. This implies that the Reapers are a natural phenomenon whose manifestation could be prevented if the paradox was resolved quickly. However, with the elimination of the other Time Lords in the Time War, there was no longer any agency that could repair time.RefusianRillRitual motorcyclesA pair of organic motorcycles with AI brains feature in the comic Jetsam. The bikes are used in a ritual by a race of aliens to settle minor conflicts such as wars and border disputes. The bikes allow the user to harness their childhood fears to aid their courage in combat. In Jetsam, a pair of bikes get washed ashore after a shipwreck. One possesses Toshiko who, having fought free of the bikes control, convinces her combatant, the leader of a local bike gang, to surrender. However, when the biker tries to stab Toshiko, the bike kills him for breaking the agreement.RutanSSand beastSavageScarecrowStraw-filled foot soldiers created by Son of Mine, using molecular fringe animation. They were relentless and untiring, with rudimentary intelligence. Even after being cut down by machine-gun fire, they could be reanimated.Another type of scarecrow which came alive were set to appear in the unmade movie Doctor Who Meets Scratchman.Sea DevilSea Devils were turtle-like humanoids that lived in Earths oceans millions of years before humans evolved. They believed that a small planet would crash into Earth, which became Earths moon. Like the Silurians, they went into hibernation and wanted to take the planet back from humans when they awoke.Seaweed creatureSelachian The Selachain are a marine race that physically resemble salmon but have developed armour that allows them to breath on land and wear helmets carved to resemble sharks as psychological warfare tactic.SensoriteSerfianGiant insect or beetle type species. First mentioned in Pest Control (audio book). Dr Lanovia said that she found the eggs laying in a ditch. She placed the eggs in the militaries inoculations. The eggs began to incubate in the human body, eventually the insects destroyed their human host.Sex gasAn unnamed gaseous alien parasite that comes to Earth to feed on orgasmic energy in Day One. Composed of vorax and ceranium gases, Earths atmosphere is poisonous to the alien, so it needs to take a human host to survive for prolonged periods. It vies for control with its host, causing physiological changes that will eventually cause the hosts internal organs to explode.The alien also makes its host secrete a blend of ultra-powerful pheromones that cause tremendous sexual attraction in those around it for the purposes of feeding. Coupling with the host is fatal, causing the hosts partner to disintegrate into a pile of dust at climax and allowing the alien to absorb the energy from the orgasm.The BBC Torchwood website lists it as the Sex gas. Producer T Davies,( in the documentary series Torchwood Declassified, refers to it as a sex monster.()ShalkaThe Shalka appear to be a serpentine alien race made of living rock and magma, but they are actually bioplasmic entities, living plasma, their physical appearance merely a crust concealing their true forms. They breathe volcanic air and prefer high temperatures, being most comfortable underground where lava meets rock. They communicate through high-pitched screaming, which they can use for a variety of effects, like tunnelling through rock or mentally controlling other life forms. They also use sound as a part of their technology.In an alternate timeline, the Shalka arrived on Earth via meteorite, initially landing near Ruapehu, New Zealand, subsequently establishing a beachhead for their planned invasion of Earth beneath the Lancashire town of Lannet. They also created a stable wormhole for landing their invasion force, which could also be converted into a hole to dispose of their enemies, as they tried to do with the Doctor.As they claimed to have done to billions of planets before, they intended to implant Shalka larvae into key segments of the population, mind controlling them into emitting a scream that would destroy the layer. In this way, the Shalka intended to raise the surface temperature of the planet to the point where the human race would perish but the Shalka could thrive. The Shalka would then live beneath the surface, with the rest of the universe believing that Earths inhabitants had died of self-inflicted ecological damage. The Doctor defeated their plans with the help of the British military and a Lannet barmaid named Alison.They are not technically Doctor Who monsters since they appeared in a failed attempt to restart the series before it was permanently revived.ShambonieAn alien race said to have big foreheads.ShansheethThe Shansheeth are a race of vulture-like aliens which appear in of the Doctor by Russell T Davies. A fleet of Shansheeth announce to Sarah Jane via UNIT the death of the Doctor, and take charge of the funeral procession; Mr Smith confirms their status as the undertakers of the universe, finding fallen heroes on battlefields. However, the band of Shansheeth Sarah Jane and former companion Jo Jones (Manning) encounter want to use the companions memories of the Doctor, in conjunction with their Memory Weave device to create a TARDIS key with which they can steal the TARDIS and prevent death across the timeline. Sarah and Jo, instead, overload the device, which blows up and destroys the Shansheeth along with their UNIT accomplice. The main branch of the Shansheeth later apologise to Sarah Jane for the actions of this rogue group.ShrivenzaleSimonSimon was an alien mentioned on the Torchwood website, specifically in an article attached to, and especially in, Amanda Davies diary. He was travelling on Earth, seeking to discover the source of life. He wandered into a countryside village and was taken in by the Davies family. Simon, having based his appearance on Jon Bon Jovi, near-instantly seduced the familys daughter - Amanda, and ultimately left her pregnant with an alien baby (which itself quickly developed, and began to degrade her health). Simon then disappeared around the same time as Jack Harkness arrived (implying he had been captured or killed by Torchwood), and later Jack met with Amandas father and (apparently) made an agreement to have the entire village, including Amanda, subjected to amnesia pills, have all records and evidence that the Davies existed in the village (including Amandas diary) confiscated, have the alien baby removed before Amanda died, and then send the Davies family away with a new identity.The First SeniorThe First Senior is an organization from an alien planet featured in the novel Princes. Like all Torchwood spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.The race that inhabit the planet are described as shades, wraith-like shadows covered in thorns. This is their true form but they are able to take on any shape they desire. When taking on a different form, they dont just change appearance, but physically change into the object they are copying. However, when not inhabiting their true form, they lose many of the advantages that stem from it including near invisibility and extreme speed. They do however retain superior strength and an excellent fighting ability. This is evident by the fact a shade can take on a fully functional Serial G unit, and crush The Amok with its bare hands.Despite being gaseous, they have sentient robotic brains capable of and downloading information from a central server on their planet and performing complex calculations.Similar to Torchwood Three, The First Senior monitor the Rift, at another of its anchor points on their planet. However, their organization is a lot more advanced than Torchwood; on their home planet, they have an entire family dedicated to guarding the Rift (the Border to them), led by the Border Prince.When The First Senior discovered the existence of Torchwood, out of curiosity, they sent in an agent known as The Principal. The Principal took the guise of a human, James Mayer, who inserted himself into Torchwood by implanting himself into the teams memories, making them believe he had always been a member. The First Senior then erased The Principals own memories so that he couldnt inadvertently reveal his true identity.Also inserted onto Earth was a protector for The Principal, Mr Dine. Mr Dine made sure The Principal didnt come to any harm and that The Principal was efficiently recalled when his time with Torchwood was over. When The Principal is to be recalled, he regains his memory, through a computer signal, and all memories of him are removed from people he has interacted with, through the removal of a 100 mile wide memory-creation radius.SilurianSisterhood of KarnSkithThe Skith are ice-based, telepathic aliens. They see themselves as explorers and seekers of knowledge, but their methodology is to pull information from the minds of others. They appear as humanoid figures made of blue ice, except the Skith Leader, who is a larger figure made of red ice, and the Mindcore, which transmits telepathic information to and from the Worldmind on their homeworld, and resembles a giant, tentacled head, made out of blue ice. Those infected by Skith telepathic ice gradually become Skith-like drones themselves.They first appeared in the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip The First (#s 385389), where they are based at the South Pole, and intercept the Shackleton expedition, before being stopped by the Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones. In the story Age of Ice (#s 408410), the surviving Skith Leader reappears in present-day Australia, when he believes his people have come to rescue him. However, in the time that has passed since The First, the Skith philosophy has changed, and they are now initialising a fullscale invasion. Based on the information absorbed from the Doctors mind in the earlier story, they have constructed a duplicate TARDIS.In The Crimson Hand (#s 416420), it is revealed that the first action of the Hand was to destroy the Skith Throneworld.SkonnanSlitheenThe Slitheen are a family of massive, bipedal extraterrestrials. They are creatures of living calcium, hatched from eggs and native to the planet Raxacoricofallapatorius. While, strictly speaking, the name Slitheen refers to a specific family, the term has been used by the Doctor to refer to the Raxacoricofallapatorian race in general.The Slitheen have appeared in the Doctor Who episodes of London, War Three and Town and the interactive episode, of the Graske. Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love, a mini episode of The Sarah Jane Adventures for Comic Relief, featured Corbett as a small Slitheen.SlitheenThe Slitheen are a family of large bipedial extraterrestrials. They first appeared in Aliens of London and World War Three (both in 2005). The Slitheen are able to wear a humans skin as a disguise; in Aliens of London they use the Prime Ministers skin to attempt to take over the British government. The Slitheen are mostly made of calcium so they have a weakness to acid (vinegar).SlytherThe Slyther was a monster that served the Daleks. It was seen in episodes four and five of Dalek Invasion of Earth (1964), guarding the Dalek mines in Bedfordshire. After the Slyther attacked a small group of humans, killing Ashton, Ian hit it with a rock, causing it to fall down a pit to its death.Smilers/Winders, TheThe Smilers are androids which are mounted inside booths across Starship UK (a country which abandoned the Earth after a series of dangerous flares in the 29th century). The Smilers rotate their heads to show three faces; happy, warning or very dangerous. They let the people of Starship UK know whats good and whats bad, and if the Starship is under a security threat, The Smilers can leave their booths and move around.SolonianSontaranSontaransThe Sontarans were referred to in of the Gorgon by Bea who said they looked like a huge potato with a radar. Commander Kaagh appears in Series 2 in the story Last Sontaran after the destruction of his battle fleet as well as the death of the other Sontarans on board in the Who two-parter episodes Sontaran Strategem and Poison Sky. He returns in of the Bane, where he sides up with Mrs Wormwood, the recurring Bane. In the end, he sacrifices himself to foil her plans of the destruction of Earth.SpiridonThe Spiridons featured in the serial of the Daleks (1973). They were the dominant species of sentient humanoids on planet Spiridon in the Ninth System. They had developed a form of invisibility but became visible after death. They had been subjugated, to be used as experimental subjects and slaves, by the Daleks who were attempting to discover the secret of the Spiridons invisibility and reproduce it for their own use. Some of the Spiridons, including one called Wester, resisted. They wore furs to keep themselves warm. The Doctor returns to Spiridon in spin-off audio adventures of the Daleks and of the Daleks.Star whaleThe Star Whale is a giant whale like creature, presumed to be the last of its kind, used to pilot the Starship UK, so as to save its citizens from the dangerous solar flares. The whale has the features of other animals such as an anglerfishs angler, an octopus tentacles and a scorpions tail. It arrived on Earth as it heard the children of the United Kingdom crying, and was unable to bear the sound. Believing its arrival to be a one-in-a-million miracle, the people of Britain captured it and built their ship around it, torturing it in order to keep the ship flying. Over the years, they realised that they could not justify keeping the creature in agony, but feared that if they set it free, the ship and all those aboard would be destroyed, so they chose to forget, and fed those who protested to the beast. When the Doctor learnt of this, he decided to render the creature brain-dead, ending its suffering and saving the lives of all those on the ship, but Amy set it free, revealing that the whale had volunteered to help, and that contrary to the beliefs of the stations masters, that it would continue flying without the need to torture it.StigoraxSwampieSwarm (virus)SycoraxThe Sycorax first appeared in the debut Doctor story Christmas Invasion in 2005.The Sycorax appear to be skinless humanoids wearing mantles of bone, usually keeping their features concealed under helmets. They are proficient in the use of weapons like swords and whips, the latter which can deliver an energy discharge that disintegrates the flesh of its target. Their language is called Sycoraxic. The Sycorax also appear to have technology that is either disguised or treated as magic, referring to curses and the Doctors regenerative abilities as witchcraft. The Sycorax leader referred to an armada that they could use to take Earth by force if their blood control plan failed. They also appear to have a martial society, with traditions of honourable combat, yet they have no qualms about killing prisoners. According to the BBC website, the Sycorax facial structure was inspired by the skull of a horse.According to a write-up by T Davies on the BBC website, the Sycorax originated on an asteroid in the distant JX82 system, known as the Fire Trap. They were uplifted when a spaceship crashed on their asteroid and the Sycorax Leader enslaved the survivors, forcing the aliens to teach them about their technology. The asteroid was then retrofitted into the first of many spaceships, which the Sycorax then used to raid other planets, becoming feared interstellar scavengers. This reputation is made clear in their attitude to other inferior races. The Sycorax leader comments to Rose that he would not dirty his tongue with her language, and their translated word for human can also be taken to mean cattle. Their armada is permanently in orbit around the Jewel of Staa Crafell.In The Doctor Who Files books, the name of the Sycorax homeworld is given as Sycorax. It is unclear if this is another name for the Fire Trap. Furthermore, after the destruction of the Fire Trap, the Sycorax spread further through the galaxy, and like humans are one of three species that continually survive and adapt, even unto the End of the Universe.(Doctor Who Starships And Spacestations 2008)The name Sycorax is used in Shakespeares play Tempest. Shakespeares Sycorax has died before the play begins; she is described as a witch who was the mother of the beast Caliban. The Shakespearean name is referenced in the third series episode Shakespeare Code when the Doctor finds a horses skull in The Globes prop cupboard. He comments that it Reminds him too much of the Sycorax. Shakespeare remarks he likes the sound of the word, obviously then going on to use it in Tempest.The Sycorax also make a brief appearance in the Doctor episode Pandorica Opens as one of the races in the alliance formed to trap the Doctor.TTaran beastTenzaTerileptilThe Terileptils appeared in the Doctor serial The Visitation by Saward. They are a humanoid species, they cannot survive long without breathing soliton gas, which is highly combustible when combined with oxygen. As an advanced society, they enjoy a heightened appreciation of both aesthetics and warfare, and have been known to employ bejewelled androids. Criminal punishment in Terileptil society includes life imprisonment working in tinclavic mines on the planet Raaga, often with sub-standard medical care.In 1666, a group of Terileptil prison escapees hidden near London attempted to use a genetically enhanced version of the Plague to destroy humanity. The destruction of their lab in Pudding Lane, with help from the Doctor, causes the Fire of London.The Terileptils destroyed the Screwdriver which did not appear again until the Doctor Who TV Movie.According to the Missing Adventures novel The Dark Path by A. McIntee, by the 34th century, their homeworld Terileptus is a member of the Galactic Federation, and a noted builder of starships. A Terileptil also appears as the chief engineer on a Federation starship. The planet is destroyed during the events described in the novel.TerradonianTeselectaThe Teselecta, first shown in Kill Hitler, is a robot-like machine with the ability to change its appearance. It is commanded by humans, however smaller robots referred to as antibodies patrol its interior and incinerate intruders. The Teselecta are sent through time by an organization called The Justice Department with the intent to remove people from their established time stream to enforce punishment on them, though it does this only shortly before their end. This is regarded as a responsibility that comes with the capability of time travel. The Teselecta is not bigger on the inside, instead its crew are actually shrunk by means of a miniaturization ray and a compression field. They have access to numerous files on important people. In Lets Kill Hitler, Amy and Rory are trapped within a Teselecta and chased by its robotic immune system, the antibodies.(BBC - Doctor Who - Lets Kill Hitler - News & Features) Wrist-bands worn by the crew stop the robots attacking them, and anybody not wearing this band is incinerated. Later in the episode the crew of the Teselecta are evacuated by what appears to be a trans-mat-beam. The Teselecta reappears in the Series 6 Finale Wedding of River Song. The Doctor is supposed to be killed in Lake Silenco, Utah,  so he hides with his TARDIS inside the robot which takes his form, making it appear he is killed. To the extent of how much the Teselecta imitates a lifeform, it expelled light similiar to regeneration energy when faking the Doctor trying to save himself.TetrapThe Tetraps are a bat-like race from the planet Tetrapyriarbus. A pack of Tetraps was employed by the Rani to help defend her Giant Brain in the Doctors debut story, and the Rani (1987) by and Jane Baker. The Rani armed a pack of Tetraps for this purpose and used them as general henchmen to terrorise the native Lakertyans.Tetraps have four eyes, one on each side of their head, giving them all-round vision, and put this to good use in stalking fugitives. Like bats, they sleep by hanging upside-down in a cavern. They feed off a dark red-coloured sludge that the Lakertyan leader releases down a chute into a trough.Tetraps possess limited intelligence, but they soon realise that the Ranis plans would have them all killed on Lakertya. This is confirmed when their leader, Urak, hears of her plans and she later leaves him to guard over her laboratory rather than take him with her in her TARDIS, thus condemning him to death. Urak and the enraged Tetraps capture the Rani in her ship and take her back to their home planet, to force her to help solve their natural resource shortages.ThalTharilThe 456The 456 (pronounced four-five-six not four hundred and fifty-six) served as the main antagonists during the third series.They are unnamed aliens with whom the government of the United Kingdom made a deal in 1965; the 456 extorted twelve children in return for a cure to an Earth-bound virus which was about to mutate. They are only known by the frequency they are using, 456. When asked for their species name by John Frobisher, they chose to go by this name. They seem to require (or at least prefer) a highly toxic atmosphere, and to be non-humanoid of form, possessing three insect like heads which appear to spew green slime whenever the creatures are aggravated or pressured. In Children of Earth: Day Four, parts of the 456 were briefly seen when a government operative entered its chamber with a portable video camera. It had 3 heads, which possessed mandibles. The rest of the body is trunklike, like a giant caterpillar. A swelling is briefly shown at the end of the creature. After the 456 return to Earth over forty years later, an ambassador of the species demanded that 10% of the worlds children be given to the race as a gift, or else the entire human race would be destroyed. To ensure humanity would accept this deal, the 456 announced their arrival several days in advance by possessing and speaking through every pre-pubescent child on earth. A closer view of the visiting 456 specimen showed it had incorporated the bodies of human children into its own, the two being connected by four vine-like tentacles, because of an unnamed chemical pre-pubescents produce that the creatures use like a drug. According to the 456 themselves, such children feel no pain, and live long beyond their natural span. The children do not appear to have physically grown, although they are wizened perhaps mutated in some way and appear to be aware of their surroundings and their own condition; they breathe using respirators. The 456 are responsible for the death of Jones when they release a deadly virus into a building where Ianto was present. They are eventually defeated when Harkness manages to reverse the frequency of a previous transmission made by the 456 and turn it into a weapon against them, driving them away from Earth, although he is forced to sacrifice his grandson Steven to use him as the source of the frequency broadcast in the first place.The AbominationMentioned in Lisas Revenge, The Abomination is a fifteenth-century painting by Giuseppe Di Cattivo. The painting was considered too terrifying to be seen. The paint used contained a mineral that hosted an alien organism. Once in close proximity to the Lisa (painted with the same mineral paint), the Abomination and Mona Lisa came to life. The painting of the Abomination was stored in a vault that required a complex puzzle key to open it. When Mona Lisa came to life, she sought the key to release the Abomination.The BerserkerThe Berserkers were a cult of aliens that used pendants that give the wearer psychic powers, so that others are compelled to obey them. In the episode Mark of the Berserker, one such pendant was found at Park Vale School, by a boy, Jacob. He used the pendant but discarded it, fearing its power and the mysterious tattoos it produces on the wearer. Rani picked it up, and then put it in Sarah Janes attic. When Clyde invited his estranged father, Paul Langer, to see the alien artefacts stored in the attic, his father stole the pendant. He used it to make Clyde forget about his mother and friends, calling Clyde his soldier. Clydes father was possessed until Clyde threw the pendant into the sea and destroyed its power.The DarkAllies of The Blue Beast, Pwccm, The Dark are beings made of pure darkness that feature in the novel Twilight Streets. Normally these beings would have been defeated and sent back to the Rift by Abaddon, but Jacks defeat of Abaddon allowed the Dark free rein. As the team investigated the situation, the Dark showed them glimpses of an alternate future where the Dark corrupted Toshiko, Owen and Gwen, driving them to capture Jack and use his immortality as a means of controlling the Rift, thus gaining access to advanced technology and turning Torchwood into a world-spanning empire. It is only thanks to Iantos sacrifice that Jack is able to draw the Dark out of his friends by engaging the Rift Manipulator, although he, Tosh and Owen die in the process. With the knowledge of this future driving them, the team are thus convinced to work with Bilis Manger by channelling the Dark into a box and subsequently sending them back into the Rift. Like all Torchwood spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.The DeadThe Dead are an alien species appearing in the episode Lost Souls, broadcast on Radio 4 to celebrate the switching on of the Hadron Collider. In the episode The Dead managed to enter our universe during a test run of the machine, and fed off the neutrons of the humans it came in contact with. It had psychic abilities to persuade humans that it was deceased friends of people it came in contact with, which it used on Dr Harrington and Ianto Jones. It was destroyed when Torchwood, working with Martha Jones and the staff at CERN, fired an anti-proton beam into the Large Hadron Collider.The E0*ty CH53DThe Family of BloodThe Family of Blood was an alien race that feasted on Lords to prolong their own lifespan and increase their powers. Shortly before World War I, a family of them came to Easton Boys School, where they took over peoples bodies in order to get to the Doctor. They used animated scarecrows for henchman and to find bodies for the family in order to take them over. When they located the Doctor (who had converted his biology from Time Lord to human, they sent an army of scarecrows to hunt him. The Doctor eventually resumed his Time Lord form and imprisoned all of the familys members.The FloodA nickname given by the Tenth Doctor to the aquatic infection found in the water found in Mars ice caps. When the Flood infect a human, the hosts irises fade to white, his teeth blacken and cracks form all around his mouth. The resulting zombie-like creature then seeks to infect everyone around it with the water that they can shoot from any part of their body. The Mars base Bowie Base One fell under the Flood.The Headless MonksUnknown which planet these creatures come from. They wear cloaks with hoods draped over their necks to give an impression that they once had a head. Then the hood is removed it is seen that the skin has been tied into a tight knot where the head has been cut away.The LightAllies of the Grey Beast, Abaddon, The Light are beings made of pure halogen that feature in the novel Twilight Streets. The headless monks were also known for recently being spotted at the London riots.The SanctifiedThe Sanctified() are a race of bipedal aliens who appear in the serialised Magazine comic Rift War. They exhibit a crimson mane and no facial flesh - just muscles and tendons. Their primary objective upon Earth is to stop Torchwood from using the Rift to destroy the Sanctified - an event which is yet to occur.The SilenceThe SwarmAlso know by the Unified Intelligence Task-Force (U.N.I.T) as Stingrays, they are flying ray-like creatures, with metal exoskeletons that allow them to travel from planet to planet via wormholes. They consume everything on a planet, turning it into desert; and then swarm over the planets surface, generating a wormhole which allows them to travel to the next planet.The Stingrays are apparently arthropods, as they are exothermic, and possess an exoskeleton composed of metal that has been ingested then exuded to the exoskeleton. They are voracious feeders, eating both organic and inorganic materials ranging from flesh and bone to plant matter to metals and plastic. They also produce vast numbers of young and grow from birth to adult in under a year, as shown when the doctor shows a year-old clip of San Helios before its Stingray infestation.They travel to other planets through wormholes created in the fabric of Spacetime by circling a planet faster and faster, and as each swarm can contain billions of giant stingrays, they rip a hole in space. Their wormholes can transport the whole swarm an infinite distance through space.The Tricksters BrigadeThe Tricksters Brigade serve the recurring Sarah Jane Adventures villain, The Trickster. They, which takes shape of many lifeforms such as a beetle, also feed on chaos in time as the Trickster does. In Turn Left, a Time Beetle, a member of The Tricksters Brigade, attaches itself onto the back of companion Noble, altering time to where she never met the Doctor in The Runaway Bride, leading to his death. This causes the deaths of to-be-companion Jones as well as The Sarah Jane Adventures characters Jane Smith, Luke Smith, Jackson, and Langer (and Jones) who attempted to restore the Royal Hope Hospital back to its location and halt the plans of the Judoon. London is destroyed after the fall of the Titanic (Voyage of the Damned) and no help is offered from America due to the Adipose crisis (Partners in Crime). Torchwood Three sacrifices themselves to save planet Earth from the Sontarans (Poison Sky) to keep the air unpoisoned. Donna is able to foil the brigades plans before reality is destroyed by Davros.In the Torchwood episode Sins, Harkness and Angelo Colasanto discovers that The Tricksters Brigade plans to cause the victory of Germany by assassinating Delano Roosevelt by use of a brain parasite.The TricksterThe Trickster is a being beyond the universe which seeks to manifest itself through causing chaos. It can interfere in deaths, by making deceptive deals to prolong life at a price. It can only exist within the universe for brief periods, without physical form, sometimes in a mirror or other reflective surface. It is a member of the Pantheon of Discord. Played by Marc Davis, the Trickster is a recurring nemesis in The Sarah Jane Adventures. Though the character does not directly appear in the series related programmes (parent show Doctor Who and adult sister show Torchwood), the Tricksters attempts to change history have nevertheless been depicted.In Happened to Sarah Jane?, in order to create chaos of sufficient magnitude, the Trickster removed Sarah Jane from history so that an asteroid that only she could have stopped would hit the Earth. The Trickster altered an incident in Sarah Janes childhood in 1964 that originally led to the death of her best friend Andrea. The Trickster switched the places of the two girls after gaining Andreas consent, creating a timeline in which Sarah Jane died at age 13. Preferring a meaningless destruction of Earth rather than for profit or military conquest, the Trickster also influenced the various alien threats Sarah Jane had faced on Earth to stay away from the planet, creating a peaceful timeline up until the impending asteroid strike. Keeping Sarah Jane in Limbo, it further planned to use her to find and remove the Doctor from history, which would create a timeline of diabolical chaos, wherein the many tragedies the Doctor averted would have instead proceeded.The Time Beetle that consumed time energy by changing an individuals personal timeline in the Doctor Who episode Turn Left was described as part of the Tricksters Brigade. Its alteration of Nobles history led to the Doctors death, resulting in a timeline similar to that planned by the Trickster. The alternate timeline included the off-camera deaths of Sarah Jane, Luke, Clyde, Rani and Maria - as well as the Doctors would-be companion, Jones - in the events otherwise depicted in Smith and Jones.In Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith, the Trickster returned with the Graske. It manifested in 1951 after Sarah Jane saved her parents lives. By 2008 it had completely devastated the planet and enslaved the human population, and was working on conquering other planets. Sarah Jane returned to the point of his manifestation in an attempt to stop him, but could not think of a suitable method. Her parents willingly drive off in their car, leading to their death, causing the Trickster to vanish and the original time to be restored. The Trickster materialised through the Abbotts Gate at the old monastery in Sarah Janes home village of Foxgrove. This entry point was razed for the construction of an A road in 1964.(Mr Smith states the history of Foxgrove to Sarah Jane at her request in Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith)The Trickster returned in Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith, having made a deal with lawyer Peter Dalton after an accident at home, granting Dalton his life and the love he never had, Sarah Jane Smith. Sarah Jane fell in love with Dalton, and agreed to marry him, but the wedding was interrupted by the arrival of the Doctor. The Trickster took the hotel out of time, trapping Sarah Jane and Peter in one second while the Doctor, K9, Luke, Clyde and Rani were trapped in another. Realising that the Trickster intended for Sarahs marriage to end her life of defending the Earth, Sarah Jane convinced Peter that he must break the deal, sacrificing himself so that Sarah Jane could continue to save the world. The Trickster made reference to the Tenth Doctors future regeneration and added that the Doctors first meeting with the Pantheon of Discord had sent ripples back through time. The Trickster was revealed to be vulnerable to artron energy, the power source of the TARDIS; Clyde became charged with artron energy when he came in contact with the TARDIS while it was attempting to penetrate the Tricksters time rift. He was able to use the energy to harm the Trickster, draining its energy long enough for the Doctor to penetrate the Tricksters temporal trap.The Trickster is briefly referenced in the Miracle Day episode Sins. In the episode, Captain Jack Harkness and his boyfriend/companion Angelo intercept and destroy an alien parasite that the Tricksters brigade had planned to use to infect Delano Roosevelt and create an alternate timeline where Germany won War Two.TigellanTime BeetleThe Time Beetle(In the Who Confidential episode accompanying Turn Left, T Davies stated that the production team refer to it as the Time Beetle.) is a member of the Tricksters Brigade, a group of aliens that serve the Trickster. The Time Beetle, similar to the Trickster himself, feeds on time energy and can cause a victim to change a decision they made in the past, thereby altering history. The change in history is usually very minor, affecting only the person the beetle attaches to, and the universe usually compensates for the discrepancy.When the beetle attaches to Donna in Turn Left, it prevents her from ever meeting the Doctor, resulting in disaster for Earth. The Doctor, Martha Jones, Sarah Jane Smith, and Torchwood staff Jones and Cooper were all killed, the city of London was completely destroyed when the Titanic crashed into Buckingham Palace, Captain Harkness was taken to the Sontaran homeworld, and millions of people died from threats the Doctor would have otherwise prevented. If the alternative future had continued, reality would have been destroyed by Davros.In an accompanying Monster Files episode, Captain Jack raised doubts over whether the whole of the Tricksters Brigade consists of beetles, suggesting all individuals are of different species.In the Torchwood episode Sins, the Tricksters Brigade is mentioned as they attempt to cause the victory of Germany by assassinating Delano Roosevelt through a parasite.Time LordThe Doctor, a Time Lord who can cheat death by repairing his body into a new person, used to travel with Sarah Jane during his third and fourth incarnations. In his tenth incarnation, he meets Sarah Jane again in the Doctor Who episode School Reunion (prior to of the Bane), where along with a new model of K-9 he gives Sarah Jane multiple sonic lipsticks as well as a wristwatch that detects alien life. In Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith, he helps her escape from the Trickster during her wedding. He later returns in his eleventh regeneration in of the Doctor where he joins Sarah Jane and Jo Jones to foil a plan by the Shansheeth who want to steal his TARDIS.ToclafaneThe Toclafane(Their name has been quoted by Doctor Who Fact Files on the BBCs website as meaning roughly Fool the fan, in French. It has actually no meaning in that language.) are the last remnants of humanity from the year 100 trillion. Originally intending to travel to Utopia, the last refuge of a dying universe, they find nothing but the dark and the cold of space. Losing the last shred of hope they had, they turned on themselves, cannibalising their own bodies to create a new cyborg race. As part of this process they regress into little more than children with shared memories. The name Toclafane is given to them by the Master, who takes it from the Gallifreyan equivalent of the bogeyman.The Toclafanes cyborg forms possess energy devices capable of killing and disintegrating targets. They are equipped with numerous retractable blades. The first four to be seen also exhibit apparent teleportation or cloaking abilities, not displayed by others of their race. All that remains of their bodies are barely recognisable human faces wired into basketball-sized mechanical spheres.In Sound of Drums/of the Time Lords, the Master rescues four Toclafane from the end of the universe prior to an eventual Freeze, using them to fake a first contact situation in order to draw the worlds leaders into one place for easy capture. He then uses a paradox machine to allow the future of the human race to slaughter many in the present, in short bringing the six billion humans that are alive in the year 100 trillion to return in the form of the Toclafane. The paradox machine creates a temporal paradox, allowing them to kill their ancestors without damaging themselves, and thus establish the Masters rule over Earth. After subduing Earth, the Master aims to establish a new Lord empire with himself as the leader and the Toclafane as his people and ground troops. This plan is foiled when the paradox machine is destroyed, causing time to rewind and trapping the Toclafane back at the end of the universe.The Toclafane feature on the cover of the Series Adventures novel, Story of Martha, which chronicles Marthas adventures during The Year That Never Was.TorajiiA sentient star featured in the episode 42. The crew of a cargo ship uses a scoop on Torajii to refuel their ship, unaware that it is actually a living creature. Torajii then uses the stolen particles to possess crewmembers and kill them.TractatorTrakeniteTravist PolongTravist Polong is an orange, metre-long, five-eyed slug/slater-like alien. Sarah Jane attempted to catch it at a hospital at Tarminster in Mark of the Berserker, but left to deal with a Berserker.Travist Polong was later delivered to Sarah Jane in Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith after she saw it on eBay in its dormant stage. Rani and Clyde took it inside Ranis house, but it escaped. They chased it to 13 Bannerman Road, where they caught it in a garbage can. Sarah Jane directed Rani to order Mr Smith to teleport it to Polongus, its home planet. Sarah Jane described Travist Polong as not evil, just trouble.TrionTritovoreHumanoid fly creatures, they trade with other civilisations for their excrement. They communicate with clicks that the TARDIS didnt translate because it was not on the same planet as The Doctor and Lady Christina de Souza. The Doctor speaks with them through their own language while they understand The Doctor through a one-way telepathic translating communication device.TythonianUUrbankanUsurianThe Usurians from the planet Usurius are a species that abandoned military conquest in favour of economic conquest. They enslaved humanity after their engineers made Mars suitable for human habitation, humans having depleted the Earths resources. Once humanity had depleted Marss resources as well, the Usurians engineered Pluto so that humans could inhabit it. They created six artificial Suns around it and installed the Collector to oversee the collection of taxes from their human workforce. They intended to abandon Pluto and leave humanity to become extinct once the humans had exhausted its resources, there being no economically viable planet to relocate humanity to once more. The humans on Pluto revolted against the Collector and seized control of Pluto. The revolutionaries intended to relocate to Earth as the Doctor assured them it would have regenerated in their absence.The Usurians have knowledge of the Lords, graded as Grade 3 in their latest market survey, considering Gallifrey to be of low commercial value. Usurians can adopt a humanoid form but in their natural state they resemble seaweed. Shock can force them to revert to their natural form. According to the Doctor, Usurians are listed in a flora and fauna of the universe written by a Professor Thripthead under poisonous fungi.UvodniThe Uvodni is a bug-like race, first introduced in of Kudlak. General Kudlak served in his races military until injuries forced him to retire. In order to gain more troops for his races continuing war effort, Kudlak was dispatched to Earth. He seized control of the Combat 3000 laser game franchise, which he secretly used to find human children with strong combat skills. These children were teleported to Kudlaks orbiting spaceship and dispatched to fight in his races war. Kudlak took orders from a battle computer that used the image of a female of his race as an avatar, which he referred to as Mistress. An error left the computer unable to comprehend the concept of the war ending, so it withheld from Kudlak an announcement of peace from his emperor for over a decade. When this fact was revealed, by intervention of Luke Smiths computer hacking, Kudlak destroyed the computer. He then dedicated his life to finding and returning the already dispatched human children, hoping to gain inner peace by doing so.VValidiumVampireA number of different types of vampire have appeared in televised Doctor Who:* In the fourth episode of the 1965 Doctor serial The Chase, the Doctor, Chesterton, Barbara Wright and Vicki encounter Dracula and Monster, who make short work of a pursuing party of Daleks. The Doctor speculates that the monsters and the haunted mansion that they inhabit are the products of nightmares created from the human psyche. As the TARDIS and the Daleks time capsule leave, it is revealed that the monsters are in fact funfair robots.* The Doctor encounters vampires whilst travelling in E-Space in the 1980 serial of Decay. The Doctor, Romana, Adric and K-9 encounter three vampires, Aukon, Camilla and Zargo. It is revealed that the three are servants of the giant King Vampire, a member of the Great Vampires who once fought a great war against the Lords but were eventually defeated. By escaping to E-Space, the King Vampire was the sole surviving member of its race. The Doctor defeats the King Vampire by launching the lesser vampires tower  actually the command module of the ship piloted by the originally human trio  and using it as a stake to pierce the giant vampires heart. The three servant vampires perish along with their king.* The Doctor, Williams and Pond encountered vampiric, lobster-like aliens in 16th century Venice in Vampires of Venice. They were able to breathe underwater and had vampire-like qualities such as a vulnerability to sunlight, no reflections and a thirst for blood. Their leader, Signora Rosanna Calvierri, has a perception filter that allows herself and her family to take humanoid forms, except for her brood which lived under the river. They planned to flood Venice in an attempt to continue their civilisation since their own planet Saturnyne was destroyed by cracks. When the Doctor foiled their plan, Rosanna committed suicide by allowing her brood to devour her.Vampires have also appeared in Doctor Who stories in other media. Vampires related to the Great Vampires seen in State of Decay are featured prominently in the Virgin New Adventures novel Harvest, the Missing Adventure Opera, the BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures novel Science, and the Big Finish Productions audio dramas Twilight and Lazarus. The Eighth Doctor Adventure Eight Doctors also features them in a flashback to State of Decay; in addition, the war between the vampires and the Time Lords is a significant plot element in the New Adventure Damaged Goods. Other vampires or vampire-like creatures have been featured in the Missing Adventure Managra, the audio drama Snake Head, the BBCi webcast Comes to Time, the short story The Feast of the Stone (featuring an alternate Ninth Doctor), the Summerfield anthology Vampire Curse, and the Torchwood website.VanirVardanVarga plantThe Varga plants (sometimes Vaarga) appeared in the Doctor episode to the Unknown and the serial Daleks Master Plan, which were essentially a prologue and main epic respectively. They were created by Nation.Varga Plants grew naturally on the Daleks homeworld, Skaro, and when the Daleks set up a base on the planet Kembel they brought some Varga plants with them to act as sentries in the jungle surrounding their base. They were suited to this as they could move around freely by dragging themselves along with their roots.Varga plants resemble cacti; they are covered in fur and thorns. Anyone pricked by a Varga thorn will be consumed by the urge to kill, while simultaneously becoming a Varga plant themself. This grisly fate befell astronauts Jeff Garvey and Gordon Lowery, and their commander, Marc Cory, was forced to kill them.The plants later made an appearance in the Big Finish audio Davros: Purity. In this, it was revealed that the Varga plants were one of the oldest species on Skaro, but for most of their history had been immobile. Since the start of the Kaled-Thal war however, exposure to radiation and chemical weapons had caused them to rapidly evolve into a much deadlier form, capable of self-locomotion. It was this discovery that caused Davros to become interested in genetically engineering creatures in order to create weapons of war. In Dalek Empire II: Dalek War, they were found on a terraformed Jupiter where they infected earth troops. They appeared in City of the Daleks where after the Time War they infested the ruined Dalek city of Kaalann on Skaro but here their appearance was much different.VarosianVashta NeradaVashta Nerada (literally: the shadows that melt the flesh) are microscopic swarm creatures which, when present in a high enough concentration, are totally indistinguishable from shadows, and use this to their advantage in approaching and attacking prey. They are described as the piranhas of the air, able to strip their victims to the bone in an instant in high enough densities. The Doctor says that almost every planet in the universe has some, including Earth, and claims that they can be seen as the specks of dust visible in unusually bright light. On most planets, however, Vashta Nerada exist in relatively low concentrations, feeding primarily on carrion, with attacks on people being comparatively rare. In the episode in the Library, an unusually high concentration of Vashta Nerada had completely overrun the 51st century Library, resulting in the apparent death of everyone inside at the time.Vashta Nerada normally live in forested areas, and reproduce by means of microscopic spores which can lay dormant in wood pulp. In the episode of the Dead, this is revealed to be the reason for their unusual prevalence in The Library, as it is made known that the books and The Library itself were constructed of wood from the Vashta Neradas native forest feeding grounds. Individually, Vashta Nerada are non-sapient, but if a large enough concentration come together, they can form a group mind of human-level intelligence capable of communication.The fourth episode of Who: The Adventure Games, Shadows of the Vashta Nerada, features them as the leading villain.VeilVeils are able to step into the bodies of others, controlling them. They can also induce a trance by touching their victims. In the episode, of the Judoon, Androvax, the last Veil, was a fugitive responsible for destroying twelve planets, and was pursued by the Judoon after the Judoon prison ship containing him crashed on Earth. He then returned on the episode Vault of Secrets, seeking help from Sarah Jane, Clyde and Rani due to the fact that he was ill and wanted to return to his own kind. Androvax was successful in awakening the survivors of the Veils as he searches for a new world for them to reside in.Venom grubVenusianVenusians are inhabitants of the planet Venus, the closest planet to Earth. They had large feet, and six arms. The Doctor often employed a form of Venusian martial art (called Venusian aikido or Venusian karate) and sang Venusian lullabies (to the tune of Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen). Venusian aikido is allegedly very hard for two-armed beings to learn. Its use appeared in the serials Inferno, of the Daleks, and others. The Doctor favored a more subtle version which involved applying a single finger, seen in Survival. The Doctor revealed to Davros in of the Daleks that a battle between the Venusians and the Daleks in the Space Year 17,000 was ended by the intervention of a group of battleships from the planet Hyperon. Although Venus today is utterly devoid of life, the Missing Adventures novel Lullaby shows Venus to have been inhabited billions of years ago, before the surface became too hot to support life.VervoidArtificially created plant-based humanoids who possess problem-solving intelligence and the power of speech; they were intended to perform tasks usually carried out by robots, but for a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately they instead decided to eradicate all of animalkind. Vervoids had about the size and strength of humans, but were covered in leaves which provided them with energy through photosynthesis. They possessed thorns so poisonous they could kill a human on contact, and could produce copious amounts of methane-based swamp gas.VespiformThe Vespiform are a insectoid species resembling giant wasps, born en masse in hives in the Silfrax Galaxy. Each possesses the ability to morph into other species. It also has the ability to breed with other species, including humans, to produce offspring. The Monster Files feature establishes them as an ancient race and that they have fought the Quarks.(BBC  Doctor Who  Videos  Series Four)Vespiform have a telepathic connection to objects called firestones, which contain part of their mind. Like Earths wasps, the Vespiform are vulnerable to water. A Vespiform-human hybrid can live a normal life as a human until a burst of intense emotion awakens its alien biology. They are said to be at war with the Quark rebels. When the Vespiform morphs into another species it emits a purple light.In Unicorn and the Wasp, when the Vespiform appears it goes on a killing spree (in the style of Agatha Christies murder mystery books) to keep anybody from revealing that it is actually the son of the rich Lady Eddison. The Vespiform attempts to kill the Doctor by poisoning his drink with cyanide. The drink was poisoned by Reverend Golightly, the human version of the Vespiform. In the end the Vespiform is killed by Donna Noble who drowns it in a lake.VinvocciThe Vinvocci are a race of spiky green aliens who first appeared in End of Time. A pair of Vinvocci came to Earth as part of a salvage operation to recover Vinvocci techonologya medical device for healing entire planets, which Joshua Naismith named the Immortality Gate. They possess disguise technology referred to by the Doctor as a Shimmer. When the Doctor notes a similarity to Bannakaffalatta from Voyage of the Damned, noting the distinction that he was small, and red, the Vinvocci are quick to differentiate themselves from the Zocci.ViperoxInsectoid creatures that attempted to destroy Earth in 1958, in the Dry Springs of Nevada.VirusViyransThe Viyrans are an elusive race of aliens heard in Finish Productions audio stories.They originate from a distant galaxy that waged a huge war using a wide variety of powerful technologically advanced weapons. A final peace agreement was reached and the biological weapons were gathered together at the Amethyst Viral Containment Station with the intention of destroying them. But then there was an incident involving the Doctor and the Daleks and all of the dangerous virus weaponry was spread throughout the universe, landing on various worlds and causing havoc.The Viyrans come from that distant galaxy. Their job is to seek out all the stray viruses, neutralise them and cure any victims, if possible. They also feel its their duty to make sure no one finds out anything about any of this, in case someone of low morals tries to track down some of these viruses themselves.They have no real spoken language, but communicate psychically or through hand motions or sometimes by trying to replicate an individuals voice. They can also time travel. What they actually look like is a mystery, but they are humanoid in shape, always appearing in a white type of suit. When they find an infected location, they block off the area and work in secret, never letting anyone know they were there, before, during or after. They collect all the victims in flying glass coffins and attempt to cure them. If the infected individuals can be cured, they are returned and their memories of the events are erased. If not, they are destroyed.The first appearance of The Viyrans was in a short story called No One Died from the 2007 Doctor Who Storybook, featuring the Doctor and Tyler. Their first appearance in an audio story was Mission of the Viyrans with the Doctor and Brown. The viral explosion is witnessed in Patient Zero. In Forgotten Planet it is revealed that Pollard is employed by the Viyrans after they cure a virus she contracted.Although they did not appear themselves, their engineered viruses were featured in Urgent Calls, Urban Myths and Wishing Beast & The Vanity Box. These one part stories (and Mission of the Viyrans) were listed in their booklets as being part of the Virus Strand arc. Some of the viruses theyve tried to neutralise include a virus that can destroy the minds of an entire planet (No One Died), a particle that can induce beneficial coincidences for communications devices (Urgent Calls), an exaggerating frenzy illness (Urban Myths), a living wish-granting device (The Wishing Beast & The Vanity Box) and a rapidly spreading contagion that crudely distorts DNA, slowly killing its victims (Mission of the Viyrans).VoganVondraxA race known as the Vondrax appear in the novel Trace Memory by David Llewellyn. According to Jack Harkness, the Vondrax are said to be one of the oldest sentient lifeforms in the universe, and feed on tachyon radiation. They are capable of time travel, and frequently change shape. In Trace Memory they adopt a humanoid form, wearing suits and bowler hats, and carrying umbrellas. The character of Torchwood agent Valentine says that in Japan they (the Vondrax) were said to resemble Samurai. In Egypt they came like gods. The Vondrax are able to kill their victims by simply looking at them, a technique that only fails to work on Jack, and in fact seems to have the reverse effect, killing the Vondrax itself.VoordVortisaurVortisaurs are fictional creatures from the Doctor series of Who audio plays by Big Finish. Much like the Reapers of the TV series, Vortisaurs are a species of time-sensitive flying reptiles with cosmetic similarities to pterosaurs. They live exclusively in the space-time vortex, the dimension which time machines like the Doctors TARDIS pass through as they travel from point to point. Vortisaurs are drawn to the chronal distortions radiated by objects traversing the vortex, and occasionally scavenge from ships wrecked and lost in that environment. Their jaws are fixed with sharp teeth; on biting, beyond the physical wound, the chronal energies of the creature age the wound and the surrounding tissue by decades. The Doctor appears to have extensive training in the handling of Vortisaurs, referring to them as bloodhounds and showing a proficiency for handling of the beasts. On at least two occasions he offers anecdotes of his days as a youth, riding Vortisaurs bareback.In Storm Warning, the Doctor encounters a flock of Vortisaurs scavenging from the hulk of a time ship; his efforts to drive them off, only result in his being attacked himself. Although he manages to retreat to 1930 France, materialising his TARDIS on board the Airship R101, he unknowingly tows one of the creatures along with him, a fact revealed when it begins to attack the airship crew. The Doctor and his new companion Charley use the Vortisaur as a ride to escape the crash of the airship. Charley takes a liking to the Vortisaur, naming it Ramsay after the then-Prime Minister James Ramsay MacDonald. After a few serials of failed domestication attempts, Ramsay is eventually released back into the vortex.Later seasons of Eighth Doctor stories also include Vortisuars. No More Lies features bridled Vortisaurs ridden by marauding time warriors; again showing his affinity for the species, the Doctor at one point mounts one of these Vortisaurs, quickly giving it the name Margaret. In The Book of Kells, the Doctor discovers that a Vortisaur has been pulled out of the space-time vortex like his own TARDIS, and turned into vellum by a group of monks. It is described as being indigo with stripes.WWater hagA bio-organic race known only as water hags which grow their babies in mens throats because they need testosterone. They appear in the novel in the Water.WaterhiveThe Waterhive is the description given to an unnamed alien race from the New Series Adventures novel Feast of the Drowned. They are composed of water and can take over the body of a drowned being. The body is thus preserved, although the eyes of their host will become pearly, forcing glasses to be worn. They infiltrated the high ranks of the Navy in order to send sailors and their loved ones to their watery graves. Their plan was to use the living drowned as human incubators for their larvae, this failed when the Doctor reduced the hive to atoms.Weeping AngelsWeevilWerewolfWirrnThe Wirrn are an insectoid race that made their debut in the 1975 Doctor story Ark in Space. The name is sometimes spelled Wirrrn, which is a spelling originating from the novelisation of the story.The Wirrn claim to have originated from Andromeda (whether they meant the galaxy, the constellation, or even a planet named Andromeda is unclear), but were driven into space by human settlers. They are slightly larger than humans, dark green and wasp-like in appearance, and live mostly in space, although their breeding colonies are terrestrial. Their bodies are a self-contained system, their lungs being able to recycle waste dioxide and only needing to touch down occasionally on planetary bodies for food and oxygen. The Wirrns life cycle involves laying their eggs in living hosts; the larvae emerge to consume the host, absorbing its memories and knowledge. A Wirrn larva is a green slug-like creature, varying in size from a few inches to 1 or 2 metres across. It can infect another organism through contact with a substance it excretes, mutating them into an adult Wirrn and connecting their consciousness to the hive mind.In The Ark in Space, the Wirrn found Space Station Nerva in orbit around an Earth devastated centuries before by solar flares. The survivors had lain in animation waiting for the planet to recover, but had overslept by several millennia. The Wirrn intended to use the sleepers as a food source and claim the empty Earth for their own, as both a means of survival and an act of revenge against the human race for taking their former territories. In the course of their plan, Noah, leader of Nerva, was infected and converted to their kind. However, Noah still retained more than a vestige of human spirit, probably thanks to the encouragements of the Doctor, and led the Wirrn into Nervas transport ship even though he knew it was rigged to explode. It did so, ending the Wirrn threat.The Wirrn have also appeared in the Doctor Adventures novel Placebo Effect by Russell, and in the audio play Wirrn: Race Memory, produced by BBV. Big Finish used them in the audio stories Dawn with the Eighth Doctor and Isle with the Sixth. A dead Wirrn appears briefly in television story Stones of Blood.XXeraphinThe Xeraphin were an ancient species encountered by the Doctor in the story Time-Flight by Grimwade. Originating from the planet Xeriphas, they possessed immense psychokinetic and scientific powers. The Doctor believed the race to have been wiped out during the crossfire during the Vardon/Kosnax war. Instead, the entire race fled to Earth in an escaping spacecraft. The ship crashed near present day Heathrow some 140 million years ago. When the Xeraphin emerged they built a Citadel to mark their new home but the Xeraphin were so plagued with radiation that they abandoned their original humanoid bodies and transformed into a single bioplasmic gestalt intelligence within a sarcophagus at the heart of the Citadel.The arrival of the Master coincided with their emergence from the gestalt state when the radiation effects had subsided, and his influence caused the emergence of a split personality of good and evil, each side competing for their tremendous power while yearning to become a proper species once again. The Master, who was stranded on Earth at the time too, succeeded in capturing the Xeraphin as a new power source for his TARDIS. However, the Doctors intervention meant his nemesis TARDIS was sent to Xeriphas where events became out of his control.Before fleeing Xeriphas and the Xeraphin, the Master took with him Kamelion, a Xeraphin war weapon with advanced shape-changing abilities dependent on the will of its controller. Kamelion was freed from the Master and joined the Doctors TARDIS crew in Kings Demons.XeronXylokFile:Xylok.jpg|thumb|Jane Smith carefully holds a Xylok life form.Xyloks are a crystalline race that crashed into Earth as a meteorite about 60 million years ago. Consequently, the Xyloks that survived the crash were trapped beneath the surface of the Earth, regrowing over thousands of millennia.After the eruption of mount Krakatoa in 1883, one of the Xyloks was found in the post-volcanic aftermath. It was eventually passed to Jane Smith by a geologist friend when she was researching volcanic activity, 18 months prior to the events of The Lost Boy. During her studies of the crystalline structure, she found that it could use her laptop to communicate. The Xylok agreed to help Sarah Jane protect Earth, and was integrated into the supercomputer Mr Smith, built by Sarah Jane under the instruction of the Xylok. Unbeknownst to Sarah Jane, this was a ploy, in anticipation that it would one day be able to release the imprisoned Xylok race. Sarah Jane and her companions were able to thwart its intentions; as a result, Mr Smith was reprogrammed and became a benefit to the human race once again.YZZarbiThe Zarbi appeared in the 1965 Doctor story Web Planet written by Strutton, and are an ant-like insectoid species, with some characteristics associated with beetles, from the planet Vortis, which were controlled by the power of the Animus. They are roughly eight feet long, and the Menoptra claim that they are little more than cattle.They possess little intelligence but were not at all aggressive until the Animus arrived. They were enslaved to the alien consciousness and considered the butterfly-like Menoptra their mortal enemies. Only they could control the woodlouse-like venom grubs, also known as larvae guns.They returned to their normal ways after the Animus was defeated by the Doctor, Chesterton, Barbara Wright and Vicki. It is presumed that the various species on Vortis are now living peacefully together.ZocciThe Zocci are a race of red diminutive spiked aliens. Voyage of the Damned featured a Zocci named Bannakaffalatta. His species was first named in End of Time, where the Vinvocci are quick to differentiate themselves from the Zocci.Zolfa-ThuranZygonSee also* List of Doctor Who villains* List of Doctor Who henchmen* List of Doctor Who robotsReferencesExternal links* The Bumper Book of Doctor Who Monsters, Villains & Alien Species* Children of the Earth BBC Torchwood sitedes races non-humaines de la srie Doctor Who

Granite_Creek_(British_Columbia)
Granite Creek  is a creek in Columbia.  It is located in a region of British Columbia called the Similkameen.  Granite Creek flows  north into the River and joins that river approximately one and a half miles to the east of British Columbia.()  It is assumed Granite Creek yielded more than $500,000 in placer gold since its discovery. Gold Nuggets worth $50 value were not unusual in the early years.  The creek was mined by Europeans and Chinese.  Granite Creek was hydraulicked near its mouth in the 1890s. ()Most historical accounts claim the creek was discovered in 1885 by a rustler by the name of Johnny Chance.  Johnny Chance stumbled upon placer gold in Granite Creek.  Another historical account indicates Granite Creek was discovered in the fall of 1884 by Briggs, Bromley and a third partner.()  A stampede  of miners headed towards Granite Creek, they created a mining camp called Granite.  Granite was named after the creek.  The camp grew and soon it was known as City, British Columbia.  The mining boom lasted only about a decade as yield from the creeks dwindled.  By 1915 Granite City ceased to exist.()References

His parents separated while he was still a young boy, his mother single-handily raised him, although his father still visited the family regularly. He has eight other siblings.He was fascinated with business at a very young age, as a child he sold indigenous food after school to contribute to the household income while his mother worked as a domestic worker. As with every business money is the key and the main objective, what he did was: whenever he got send he uses the change to buy sweets and resells the sweets at school to get more money and increase cash-flow.At the age of nine, he started cleaning yards and got paid on a weekly basis. This was a great incentive for him but later he realized that, the money coming in weekly, was not enough to buy enough stock to satisfy the demand for the product (sweets) at school. He arranged to receive the money month-end, this improve the cash-flow and the stock levels as well. As the cash-flow improved he bought a bicycle to extend his operations. The bicycle took him three years to pay-off.His first shop was a cardboard-box-shop in front of his mothers house in the black township, called the Location.EducationAs he grew up and finished secondary education, he opted to receive his tertiary education at the Technical Institute of Mining (NITM) in Arandis. He completed his education at the technical institute as a mechanic.Business careerBenjamin opened his first spares shop in Ongwediva, selling car parts. He grew this business from suppliers in Windhoek and Johannesburg and then to the world. He has several operations around the country and has expanded into neighboring Angola. His operations in Angola are property development, and has already completed several projects in Angola.Benjamin BH has branches of the BH Group of Companies across Namibia, branches in the following regions: Kavango, Oshana, Omusati, Khomas and last but not least Ohangwena.

The legal showdown that erupted between the two was over money that the BH businesses claim to have lost in non-existent orders and deliveries from Pupkewitz: the amount of money in discussion was N$4 947 250.60.   The dispute arose from payments that BH Motor Spares alleges to have made to Pupkewitz for goods that they had neither ordered nor received from the motoring mogul. BH claims that Pupkewitz invoiced and collected money for the orders.  The sum of N$4 947 250.60 is accordingly due, owing and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff which sum, the defendant, despite demand, fails and/or refuse to pay to the plaintiff.BH was represented by Sisa Namandje law firm while Pupkewitz was represented by the Lorentz Hangula inc law firm.(http://www.informante.web.na/index2.php?optioncom_content&do_pdf1&id2280)In 2009, BH was also involved in a scandal with the grandson of the former president Sam Nujoma. Joseph Nakanyala. grandson of Nujoma, tried to extort Mr. Hauwanga by using Nujomas cell phone (mobile phone) in June purporting to be the former president. In SMSes, Nakanyala threatened to kill Hauwanga if he did not give him money. Nakanyala was again caught red-handed by the police while stealing a briefcase with money from Nujomas residence and he later claimed that Hauwanga had sent him. Through some thorough investigations it was concluded that Nakanyala made all the stories up in an attempt to extort Hauwanga. Nakanyala withdrew his claims and publicly apologized to Hauwanga through lawyer Sisa Namandje.In a statement signed by Nakanyala, he acknowledged having made these allegations saying: I had no basis and right at the time of making such allegations to accuse Mr Benjamin Hauwanga. I acknowledge and recognize that the allegations I made have injured the good reputation and name of Mr Hauwanga, and I unconditionally and unreservedly apologize to him , his family, friends and all those who have been affected and inconvenienced by the false allegations I made the statement reads further. The two shook hands and embraced each other warmly after Nakanyala finished reading his apology.(http://www.informante.web.na/index2.php?optioncom_content&do_pdf1&id5345)HonoursIn 2011, Hauwanga received an Honorary Masters Degree in Entrepreneurship (honoris causa) from the International University of Management (IUM).(http://www.architectafrica.com/NETWORK/NAMIBIA/content/business-degree-conferred-bh)  He received a  Junior Achievement Laureate in Business in 2008.(http://www.ja-namibia.org/?qnode/56)References

Slz_Valley_Railway
|}The Slz Valley Railway () is a formerly 45 km long, partly disused railway line from Mlheim via Gladbach, Bensberg, Rsrath, Hoffnungsthal and Immekeppel to Lindlar in the German state of Rhine-Westphalia.S-Bahn services operate on the section between Cologne and Bergisch Gladbach, which is electrified. The remaining section was never electrified and is now largely closed, athough some of it is used for freight. The section between Rsrath and Hoffnungsthal is now part of the railway. History Cologne-MlheimBergisch GladbachBensberg section The initial plans of 1863 were to build a line from Mlheim am Rhine (now station) to Bergisch Gladbach and on to Wipperfrth. However, on 1 December 1868 the initial section was completed by the Railway Company to Bergisch Gladbach only.In 1870, the track was extended to Bensberg. This section was built as a double-track line. Trains continuing from Bergisch Gladbach needed to reverse in Gladbach station.In 1912, a connecting curve was built in Bergisch Gladbach before the terminal station. A second station was built in Bergisch Gladbach as a through station. The second station was only used for passengers and passenger trains ran to it directly by the new curve. Freight trains ran to the terminal station, where there were several sidings connecting to surrounding factories. The Zanders paper mill was and still is connected to the curve from the freight yard to Bensberg, and not directly to the freight yard.Since the opening of the new terminal station in central Bergisch Gladbach in the early 1950s, passenger trains have run there. For this reason, the connecting curve is no longer used and it was dismantled in the early 1960s. Nevertheless, there have been plans for some time to restore it so that container trains from the zinc works container terminal can avoid reversing in the old freight yard.The terminal station in Bergisch Gladbach has only been used as a passenger station prior to 1912 and since September 1965. Between 1912 and 1950 it was operated exclusively as a freight yard. With the construction of the new station building in 1950, passenger trains ran again in the railway terminus, so that until 1965, two passenger stations existed: Bergisch Gladbach Stadtmitte (city centre) at the site of the old terminus station with the newly built station building and Bergisch Gladbach station, south of the railway triangle. The passenger service between Bergisch Gladbach and Bensberg was closed on 29 September 1965, which was also the end of operation to the southern station. Freight traffic between Bergisch Gladbach and Bensberg ended on 27 May 1989.In 1974-75, the Slz Valley Railway was electrified for the Rhine-Sieg S-Bahn (now part of the S-Bahn), but not all tracks in Bergisch Gladbach station were electrified. In addition, the second track was restored between Kln-Mlheim and Kln-Dellbrck; the second track had been removed between Mlheim and Bergisch Gladbach in 1945.	In 2008, a new protected level crossing was built on the freight track at the roundabout next to the station. BensbergImmekeppel section In particular, the Gebrder Reusch company in Hoffnungsthal, then a sheet  metal manufacturer, and the Altenberg company (formally, the Rhein-Preuische Zink-, Gruben- und Htten-Gesellschaft St. Paul de Sincay & Companie), which among other things  operated a mine at Lderich near Hoffnungsthal, were very interested in links with the rail network.The line from Bensberg via Forsbach and Rsrath to Hoffnungsthal was opened in 1890. The line from Hoffnungsthal to Immekeppel was opened in 1891. This was a single-track line.Initial attempts to establish a line through the Slz Valley in 1873 failed, as the ministry rejected the new route. In 1883, a narrow gauge (gauge) railway was planned from Kalk via Rath, Rsrath and Volberg to Immekeppel. The project ultimately failed because the Prussian Ministry of Public Works refused to provide the estimated funding required amounting to 830,000 marks.In 1937, a secret three kilometre branch line was built from near Bensberg station for the transport of ammunition to Ostheim air base.() ImmekeppelLindlar section The continuation of the line to Lindlar was mainly built to connect with the Lindlar quarry and mining operations, since their freight at that time had to be taken to Engelskirchen stations or Kaiserau on the narrow-gauge Valley Railway.In 1897, the council of the Lindlar municipality formed a committee that dealt with the proposed railway, but all attempts to establish a railway failed at first. It was not until 1906 that a standard gauge railway from Immekeppel to Lindlar was approved by the government, so that construction of the line started in 1909 and it was opened in 1912. The plan provided for four stations: Obersteeg, Tscher, Linde and Lindlar. There was controversy over the naming of Tscher station. Finally in 1911 the name was changed to Hommerich. The ImmekeppelHommerich section was opened to traffic in January 1912 and the line from Hommerich to Lindlar was officially opened on 9 December 1912.Before the World War, an extension of the line was planned via Hartegasse, Frielingsdorf and Dohrgauler to Wipperfrth. This plan was never carried because of the outbreak of the war. Finally in 1927 the plan of the LindlarWipperfrth line was dropped in favour of a direct line from Bergisch Gladbach to Wipperfurth. But this line was also never built. Therefore, Lindlar station remained a sack station, which became less important and ultimately contributed to the closure of the line.By the late 1950s, a bus line was established along the railway. In 1960, the last passenger train ran between Hoffnungsthal and Lindlar, freight traffic and continued until 1966. In the same year the section was dismantled.Operations The line from Cologne-Mlheim to Bergisch Gladbach is operated on working days at 20-minute intervals and on weekends at 30-minute intervals as S-Bahn line S 11, using modern class 423 electric multiple units.Since the closure of the section of the Slz Valley Railway between Bergisch Gladbach and Lindlar, the section between Rsrath and Hoffnungsthal has operated as part of the Agger Valley Railway and is served by Bahn trains at 30 minute intervals.The line from Bergisch Gladbach station towards Bensberg to the zinc smelter is still open and on weekdays trains operate to the container terminal of und Gterverkehr Kln (Cologne port and rail freight) on Senefelderstrae.Notes References* *  External links * * * de:SlztalbahnKln-Mlheim - Lindlar

Prominent among these is the blue tiger butterfly which can be found until the summer.()()FloraSacred grovesgroves were once common at almost all villages in Sattari. They traditionally render protection to a variety of flora and fauna. Copardem, three kilometres from Valpoi, is a village famed for the sacred grove tradition known locally as Devachi rai, a tradition of community conservation carried out in the name of the local deity. Formerly spread across  of government land, much of the sacred grove is now encroached upon for cashew plantations and agriculture. The sacred grove is an excellent example of the old tradition of uneducated villagers protecting their environment.()Among its variety of flora are towering trees such as shidam (nudiflora) which support various other life forms in the grove. Creepers like garkani (Entada scandens) with their sword-like pods are found on the shidam, while the tree also houses beehives. The grove also has an evergreen species of Ashoka which bears unique saffron-coloured flowers. Pandanus furcatus known locally known as kegadi attracts village women when it bears flowers covered in yellow and soft thickets. During the monsoon, bioluminescent fungus which glitter at night grow on dead wood. The grove is also conducive for the growth of a variety of edible mushrooms such as alami, khutyali, sonyali and shringar.(In addition to mammals such as the deer, deer and deer, the tall trees attract birds including the serpent eagle, grey hornbill and hornbill.(Eleven kilometres from Valpoi town is Nanoda village that has an ancient tradition of nature worship. It is etymologically related to the naked woman tree, locally known as Nano (tirucalli pencil tree). Ancestors who lived in harmony with nature evolved the tradition of protecting the forest in honour of the local deity. Nanoda has two groves named Nirankarachi Rai after the holy spirit Nirankar: one lies on the border of Maloli and Nanoda and the other in Nanoda.(The latter is slowly being weathered away by changing values and encroachments. In the past, large areas of forest land were protected through sacred groves such as Nirankarachi Rai. One would find various species of indigenous trees in these groves and no one dared cut a tree. In this way villagers ensured their protection. The densely forested groves were also used by villagers to keep sculptures of village deities. Today, thanks to encroachments, the size of the groves has decreased, while the sculptures lie exposed to the vagaries of nature. Nanodas Nirankarachi Rai, formerly spread across a large area, but is now confined to a small patch where the species  hedu (satinwood), khait (Mimosa catechu), and chafara (Red Frangipani) trees are found. Majestic trees such as maad (coconut) have already been felled.(Inside the sacred grove are 15 stone sculptures-of Gajlaxmi, Mahishasurmardini, Ravalnath, Brahmani, a horse rider and warriors-which are a part of Goas archaeological heritage, are weathering away. Animals like sheryo (pangolin), shekaro (Malabar giant squirrel) are found in sacred groves.()ThreatsMultiple threats to the unique ecology and biodiversity of the Mhedai Wildlife Sanctuary include: illegal heavy vehicular traffic()()  mismanagement of private lands, illegal mining() and tree felling, monoculture plantations, industrial activities, poaching and dams and river diversions(), notably the Malaprabha Reservoir Project and Kalasa-Banduri Nala project.()Mhadei tiger reserveOn June 20, 2011, Ramesh, Minister of State, of Environment and Forests, advised Digambar Kamat, Minister of Goa, to propose the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary as a tiger reserve because of the presence of resident tigers. The MOEF urged Goa to seriously consider the proposal because Mhadei is a contiguous tiger landscape to Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka to its southeast and to Anshi Dandeli Tiger Reserve which has around 35 tigers to its southeast inKarnataka. Ramesh noted that the protected areas of Goa and their contiguous forests in Karnataka and Maharashtra are possibly some of the best tiger habitats in the Western Ghats and are in need of protection. He suggested expanding the tiger reserve beyond the existing Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary.()() On August 9, 2011, there was public announcement that in-principle approval was accorded by the Tiger Conservation Authority for creation of a new Tiger Reserve at Mhadei Sanctuary. Under section 38V of the Protection Act of 1972 the Goa state government was then authorised to notify Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary as a tiger reserve.()  On Aug 8, 2011, Goa Forests Minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues questioned the existence of tigers in the state. It is not my job to know whether there are any tigers here. Rodrigues also said, the state government would not reply to a directive from former union environment and forests minister minister Jairam Ramesh asking the Goa government to submit a proposal for setting up a tiger reserve, unless specifically asked for. Why should we reply?  It is alleged that the Goa governments sluggishness to acknowledge the presence of tigers in Goa is linked to the states Rs. 6,500 crore (US$ ~13,000,000.) mining industry, which rings the Western ghats and most of the tiger terrain near the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary.()There is considerable local community support for creation of the tiger reserve which would ensure long term protection of biodiversity-rich areas.( In September, 2011, the Save Goa Campaign - UK initiated a petition addressed to The Goa Chief Conservator of Forests, Dr. Shashi Kumar, IFS, in support of Goas first tiger reserve.()External sources*Map showing National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries in Goa*Map*Chorla Ghats Forest photograph*Ladkyacho falls photograph*Vazra Sakla waterfalls photograph*Vazra Sakla waterfalls photographReferences

San_Francis_Ranch
San Francis Ranch was the ranch of Valley pioneer A. Bishop and his wife, located on a creek later named for him (Bishop Creek) southwest of modern California also named after him. Bishop founded the ranch  here in August 1861, after he and his wife drove 500 cattle and 50 horses from Tejon to this spot in the Owens Valley, intending to sell cattle to the miners in the boomtown of Aurora and other mining camps in the area.On January 31, 1862, Bishops ranch was also the site were a meeting was held between the settlers in Owens Valley and leaders of the bands of Owens Valley Indians to prevent war over the trouble between them that had resulted from the killing of an Indian and a settler.  A peace agreement was made between them there.  However the peace broke down over the next months when a hold out leader of the Southern Mono Paiutes, Jim continued hostilities and the conflict escalated into the Valley Indian War.(The Owens Valley Indian War, 1861-1865, by Captain John W. Key, V., U. S. Army Reserve)The site of the former San Francis Ranch is in West Bishop in County and is marked by California Registered Historical Landmark No. 208.  The marker is on West Line Road (California Route 168) west of Muny Road, on the right when traveling west.(THE HISTORICAL MARKER DATABASE, San Francis Ranch, California Registered Historical Landmark  Number 208)References

Bochum-Dahlhausen_station
Essen-berruhrBochum-Langendreer ()   Bochum-Dahlhausen station is located in the Dahlhausen district of Bochum in the German state of Rhine-Westphalia. The station building dates from the time of the First World War. History The origins of this station date back to 1863, when the Railway Company opened a branch line from Essen-berruhr via Ost station (originally Steele station) to Dahlhausen on 21 September 1863.((  ) This line is now considered to be part of the railway between berruhr and Essen-Steele Ost junction and the railway between Essen-Steele Ost and Dahlhausen.  It was primarily used for freight, but on weekdays carriages were also attached. When the line was extended to Hattingen in 1866, a small station building was built in Dahlhausen. On 10 October 1870, the Bochum-DahlhausenBochum Langendreer line (also known as the Hasenwinkel coal line) was opened as a standard gauge railway. The communities of Dahlhausen and Linden were involved in the construction of a new station building that was completed in 1875. By this time the Valley Railway was already open to Hagen. Therefore, the building soon proved to be too small.((Consequently, in 1913 the state railways division at (Kniglich-Preuische Eisenbahndirektion Essen) began building a larger station that it had been planning since 1910 on the double-track DahlhausenSteele line behind a levy bank to prevent flooding by the Ruhr. During the First World War the station was built using prisoners of war and inaugurated on 28 February 1917.((Post-war period With the end of the mining industry in the Ruhr valley, the Ruhr Valley Railway lost its significance. A depot that was 800 m west of Bochum-Dahlhausen closed in 1969.Since 1977, the former locomotive depot has housed the Dahlhausen Railway Museum, the last fully preserved steam locomotive depot in Germany.The station building was closed in 1979, because only S-Bahn trains have operated on the line to Hattingen since 1974. Finally in 1994 the building was heritage-listed. An investor has been allowed to restore the facade and roof in the Nouveau style. The main hall has been restored to the style of the 1920s. In the late 1990s, the building housed a hotel, which operated under the name of Dampflok (steam engine). It was damaged by a fire and since then the historic station building was unused until 2009.(Since 1 September 2009, the former station building has been operated as One World Station, a forum for cultural activities, by a nonprofit organisation, ProKulturgut.Net.(  )In addition to the passenger station Dahlhausen had a marshalling yard, which is now completely dismantled. On one part of the former railway tracks, a housing estate (Ruhrauenpark), has been created, with the first houses going on sale in 2005.Future It is planned to modernise and rebuilt Bochum-Dahlhausen station to make it accessible for the disabled from 2014 at a cost of  4.3 million. The renovation will also improve links between buses and trains.ServicesDahlhausen station today consists of three tracks on two platforms. Tracks 1 and 2 are primarily used for normal S-Bahn traffic, while track 3 is used for museum services operated by the Dahlhausen Railway Museum.( In the immediate vicinity of the station building, a single-track tram line of the Stadtbahn terminates in the pedestrian zone near the station. Line 318 is the only direct tram connection from Dahlhausen to Hauptbahnhof.( It is also served by four bus lines (345, 352, 359 and 390). The trams and buses are operated by BOGESTRA.(  ) References Bochum-Dahlhausenpl:Bochum-Dahlhausen

How_to_recover_from_a_black-wake-up_in_Minecraft
How to recover from a black-wake-up in MinecraftSometimes in Minecraft, (which is such an absolutely awesome game that if you havent heard of it you should try it,) your player has what is commonly refered to, as a black-wake-up. A black-wake-up is when you have been to sleep in your bed, and you have just woken up, but for some strange reason your screen goes completely black, and you can hear the ooh, oohing sound which your player makes when he/she has either fallen off a cliff, been attacked by a monster, or a wolf, or have stayed underwater too long, touched lava, or have hurt themeselves in any way. When this first happened to me, my house was located right beside a wide, but not deep hole filled to the brim with obsidian and lava, (which I wanted to mine, but couldnt, as I didnt have a diamond picaxe, as I didnt have diamond. And if I left the hole and lived somewhere else until I found diamond, then I wouldnt be able to find my way back, because I didnt have a map. Anyway, naturally, my first thought was that during the night some of the lava had burnt down my house, and was now burning me. But I was sure that if this was the case, then the screen would not be thoroughly black, and I would see the bright orangy yellow colour of the lava. Besides, when I built a house elsewhere, the same thing happened. Both times I had to respwn, which is so annoying. Those who have respawned before will know what I mean. Then, once again it happened for the third time. This time I was so desperate to save myself. I tried everything. I even poured water on myself. But then I had an idea. I got out my spade, and made a hole in the roof. It stopped. I was alive! I realised that since my house was so small, for some unkown reason, my has had filled up. The only space was the one in which I was standing. Two blocks! I found this out by pressing F5 on my keyboard, which as you may or may not know, makes you able to see yourself. I saw myself curled up in a small space! But as soon as I made a hole in the roof, my house was normal again. Phew!So my  advice is  this - before you go to bed at night, make sure you have a tool in your inventory, that can quickly cut a hole in your roof. And dont make your house too small or your roof too low. Happy mining!
