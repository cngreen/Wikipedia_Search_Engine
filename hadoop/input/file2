Both Desloges were descendants of French nobility.(Sieur Robert Desloge who died prior to April 23, 1754)  Firmin V. Desloge, II became acquainted with mining through his father and acquired many claims in the area of what is modern day Desloge and Bonne Terre.  Desloge developed one of his claims just north of Bonne Terre and built a concentrating plant there.The plant was destroyed by fire in 1883 and rather than rebuild, Firmin Desloge decided to explore his properties in the present area of Desloge.  This new plant and the consolidation of several local mining companies under the Desloge family name became known as the Consolidated Lead Company. In 1887, the land was cleared and company houses for his staff were constructed in an area referred to as Desloge Town, just west of the present day railroad tracks.  Here, Desloge sank a shaft and built a concentrating plant which commenced operations in 1892.   Desloge Missouri and the regional Southeast Missouri Lead Mining District became one of the principal lead mining centers in the US.(Southeast Missouri Mining and Milling.

Starting from Smith, Arkansas, this trail was carved by thousands of Cherokee miners in the 1850s and 1860s, who sought gold mining rushes in Colorado, Wyoming and CaliforniaOn July 26, 1806, Captain Meriwether Lewis with George Drewyer (Drouillard), Joseph Fields and Reuben Fields camped with a party of eight young Blackfeet Indians. At first the meeting was cordial, but the encounter turned hostile when Lewis disclosed to the Blackfeet that the United States government had plans to supply all the Plains Indians with firearms for hunting. This was not good news for the Blackfeet, who until that point had controlled firearms through trade relations with the Hudsons Bay Company.The Blackfeet decided to make off with the partys guns and horses leaving them on foot. At this point, this was the only armed encounter with Indians during the entire expedition. Two of the young Blackfeet were killed in this fight over horses and guns.This actual site wasnt discovered until 1964 by two Cut Bank Boy Scout leaders,who used the directions and descriptions contained in Lewis journal. The three solitary trees described by Lewis in his journal still stood in the place Lewis depicted. The site has been marked and fenced by the local Boy Scouts. Captain Meriwether Lewis followed the north branch of the Marias River, now known as the Cut Bank Creek and camped south and east of Cut Bank on Monday, July 21, 1806.There wasnt any timber to be found to build a fire so buffalo chips were used. The company was nearly out of provisions. They wounded a buffalo, but were unable to retrieve it.

Monroe,_New_Hampshire
footnotes                 Monroe is a town in Grafton County, Hampshire, States.  The population was 788 at the 2010 census.(United States Census Bureau, American FactFinder, 2010 Census figures. Retrieved March 23, 2011.) The town is located along a bend of the River, across from Barnet, Vermont.  It was originally chartered as part of Lyman. History In 1762 Colonial Governor John Wentworth issued a grant (Number 11) to 64 persons obligated to clear, farm and settle one tenth of each of their parcels or forfeit the grant. Only two made the attempt but the charter was extended, in 1769, for another five years.  Eleven of the original 64 grantees were named Lyman. In that same year, Wentworth also granted to one Colonel John Hurd (of Portsmouth part of the land which is today within the bounds of Monroe. The grant was named Hurds Location and included five small islands in the River, known as Deer Islands, and a parcel of land from below the present Village Bridge to the foot of Fifteen Mile Falls.( (reprint by Higginson Book Company, Salem, MA), pp. 13 & 29)  In addition to Hurds Location, and the governors , there were 23 lots of the 64 portions of Lyman located in West Lyman, or the Lyman Plain, now Monroe, making up less than  of the present area.  A portion of Bath, to the south, was annexed in 1897.(Johnson, pp. 63, 637 (map))The first known settlers on the West Lyman portion of Lyman were John Hyndman (also, John Hinman), with his wife and son, who settled on the largest of the Deer Islands (below the present-day Barnet Bridge) in 1784 and built a log cabin. When Colonel Hurd found out about it, he sued to have Hyndman evicted. A Barnet benefactor settled the controversy by purchasing title from Hurd. The first permanent settlers also came in the 1780s. They were the Olmstead families: Joseph, Timothy, and Israel, their wives and children.(, pages 33-34)  The first native son, Ethan Smith, was born in a cabin on the Canaan Road (over the Gardner Mountain to Lyman) in 1784.Because of the difficulty traversing the steep Gardners Mountain sic, running north to south through the original Lyman grant of 1761, the settlers of the western portion had different priorities and needs than the rest of Lyman to the east. Monroe was incorporated as a separate town in 1854.(Hamilton Child, Gazetteer of Grafton County NH, 1709-1886; Syracuse NY, June 1886, History of Lyman, p. 512) After appropriate consideration of the options, it was named after former President Monroe. It had 619 residents in 1860 and 504 in 1880.(H. Child, Gazetteer of Grafton County, N.H., 1709-1886, Syracuse, N.Y.: June 1886, History of Monroe, p. 551)Captain(Title was an honorific bestowed by a grateful citizenry on many returning veterans of the Revolutionary War. Paddleford was actually a private) Phillip Paddleford, a Revolutionary soldier, settled in 1790, and built Monroes first sawmill and gristmill on what is now called Smith Brook. Notable inhabitants * Harris, who made national news in 1980 as the defendant in a high-profile murder case of her ex-lover Dr. Tarnower, a well-known cardiologist and author of the best-selling book Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet.  Harris made Monroe her home after being pardoned in 1992 and prior to moving to a retirement center in Connecticut.* Peter Paddleford, inventor of the wooden Paddleford Truss for bridges. Many of his original bridges still stand.()  He was the builder of the third Lyman Bridge from Monroe to McIndoes, Vermont, in 1833, after the 1826 floods had taken out all bridges on the Connecticut River. It was a covered bridge of pine, over  long, lasted over 96 years and was one of the oldest on the river.(Johnson, p. 146) Geology Parts of the Ammonoosuc Gold Fields, which have never been successfully mined, are in Monroe. Within the limits of the town are the narrows, at which place the Connecticut River is only five rods in width, being confined by walls of slate.(  Several copper mines were excavated along the Back Road and many parcels continue to have separate mining rights.Test borings and surface samples during the 1928-1930 construction of D. Comerford Dam, in the Connecticut River, provided new geologic information regarding de-glaciation of the White Mountains,(Thompson, Woodrow, et al., Deglaciation of the Northwestern White Mountains, New Hampshire, Gographie Physique et Quaternaire, 1999, vol. 53, n 1, found at http://www.erudit.org/revue/gpq/1999/v53/n1/004882ar.html) and became the namesake of the Comerford Suite.  The dam, located on what was once called Fifteen Mile Falls, is now used for flood control, irrigation and generation of electrical power for transmission to England states.  At the time of its construction, it was the largest retaining wall in the United States, representing more than  of concrete.(Johnson, p. 110)Prior to the establishment of a series of dams, the river dropped  in , from Dalton to Bath. Geography According to the States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which  is land and  is water, comprising 6.01% of the town. The town is bounded by the Connecticut River (which is also the state boundary with Vermont) to its west and the long ridge of Gardner Mountain to the east. Signal Mountain, a knob on Gardner Mountain, is the highest point in Monroe, measuring  above level.  It has long been a major surveying reference point for maps and plats of the area between Mansfield and Mount Washington.(NH 135 runs through the town, substantially parallel to the river, linking Monroe to Littleton to the north and Bath to the south.  A northwestern segment of Bath was annexed to Monroe in 1895, stimulated by its shared geography with Monroe.

The population was 938 at the 2010 census. The Lady on the Mountain is a rock formation on Magdalena Peak overlooking Magdalena. Spanish soldiers saw the face of a woman on the west face of the peak.  A priest with them was reminded of a similar peak in Spain called La Sierra de Maria Magdalena, so he called the New Mexico one La Sierra de Magdalena.  The natural pass to the south of the peak became known as Magdalena Gap, and when a town grew up it received the same name.(Historic Markers on the Information Superhighway: Magdalena New Mexico Department of Tourism, from Archive of 27 September 2007)(Everleth, Robert W. (2006) Our Lady on the Mountainhistory, folklore, and geology of Magdalena Peak New Mexico Geology 28(2): pp. 43-51,53)  Magdalena has recently been trying to transform itself into an art center and cultural destination. The opening of at least a dozen art galleries, a woolery, the renovation of the Bank West Building and the Magdalena Hall Hotel have all made their mark on this mountain village.  Several rock and mineral shops have been around since the mining boom days. The ghost town of Kelly and two important festivals, the Lady Magdalen Art Walk and the Old Timers Reunion and Rodeo, bring tourists to the area. Newly-paved roads, additions to the large school, a public water system, trash disposal service and the opening of a new mini-mart and gas station have improved the quality of life for its citizens. In late 2010, a Family Dollar opened right next to the locally owned Trails End Market. In 2011 a tire shop and a blacksmith shop have also opened.The Large Array is located close to the community.GeographyMagdalena is located at  (34.112596, -107.237904).According to the States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land.HistoryIn 1883, about  south of Magdalena, the Kelly Mine opened in New Mexico. In 1884, the village of Magdalena was named after Magdalena Peak when its post office opened. The next year the railroad completed a spur out from Socorro, originally intended to ship cattle from the of San Agustin, but which also proceeded to ship out ore from the Kelly Mine and others. The Kelly Mine was a significant producer of silver and zinc.

Milan,_New_York
footnotes                Milan ()(unlike the city in Italy) is a town in Dutchess County, York, States. The Town of Milan is in the northern part of the county.Historythumb|left|The 1766 Johannes Rowe House photographed in 1940, now gone. Was on Rowe Road near the Town Hall.The area that comprises Milan today was the western part of the Nine Partners Patent of 1706.  Milan was largely a farming and mill town and remains a very rural town today. The first settler in the area was Johannes Rowe.  The son of a Palatine immigrant, Rowe bought  from Robert Livingston and built a stone house in 1766 on what is now Rowe Road near the Milan Town Hall.(History of Dutchess County New York, James H. Smith, 1882, D. Mason & Co. publisher)(History of Little Nine Partners, Isaac Huntting, 1897.)  The remains of the house were photographed in 1940 for the American Buildings Survey. Town and Post Office est. 1818The New York State Legislature voted on March 6, 1818 to create the town of Milan from the western part of the Town of North East -- to be effective from and after the last day in March 1818.(Laws of the State of New York passed at the forty-first session of the Legislature, Albany 1818.  Chapter XXVIII.)  The session laws stated that the first town meeting would be held the first Tuesday of April and at the home of Stephen Thorn who was elected Supervisor along with John F. Bartlett, Clerk.Two 19th century histories of the town of Milan and Dutchess County  (1877 and 1882) state there is no knowledge or evidence as to why the name Milan was chosen.((General History of Duchess County 16091876 by Philip H. Smith, 1877: author and publisher)  But the name Milan had appeared in other areas of the state and it was not unusual to take European city names at the time.  What is now the City of Syracuse was known as Milan for a brief period between 1809 and 1812.  A settlement  south of Syracuse was originally called Milan in 1790 before incorporation in 1802 as the Town of Locke.(Town of Locke Historian Esther Thorton)  An unincorporated village there continued to be referred to as Milan(History of Locke, New York From: History of Cayuga County, New York By: Elliot G. Storke, Assisted by: Jos H. Smith Published by: D. Mason & Co., Syracuse, New York, 1879) but gave up its Milan Post Office designation on July 29, 1817, becoming Locke Post Office.  This cleared the way for the operation of the Milan Post Office on August 14, 1818 at what is now Cases Corners.(A postal history of the town of Milan, Roy Ahlquist, 1992.)So in 1818 the name Milan was secured for both the town and one of the hamlet Post Offices. A town in-between The main thoroughfares for the community ran from the River to CT and travelers referred to the road as the turnpike. It later became recognized as the Salisbury Turnpike and sections of the road still exist today and bear that name.  In addition to farming and local mills in Milan,  lead and iron were mined in areas around what is now Millerton, NY and Salisbury, CT which was then brought to Livingstons Furnaces at Ancram in Columbia County.  Milan was in-between those towns and the river and as a result had a great deal of important commercial traffic going east/west through the town.(Remains least populous townThe early population peaked in 1840 at 1,745 residents and went into decline until 1930 with only 622 residents.(US Federal Census schedules)  It was the opening of the Canal (1825) and then the development of the railroad and the move to river cities and the migration that caused the decline.  Also, Milans soil was hilly and rocky and tough to farm. Then following the 1930s and the Depression the population grew again, due in part to the construction of the Parkway which ended in Milan at the time, and then the post War II boom.  The 1840 population level was reached again in 1980, some 140 years later.  From the 1980s to the turn of the new century Milan was one of the fastest-growing towns in Dutchess County.(Milan remains the least populous town in Dutchess County.(Dutchess County Department of Planning and Development) State Historic MarkersPartial list of New York State Historic Markers in Milan:* Jackson CornersColonial Inn: Built About 1773 Stage Inn, Doctors Office, Hotel, Store, Post Office Of Jackson Corners.* Jackson CornersNobletown Road: Running From Post Road In Livingston, Through Gallatin, Ancram, State Line, Nobletown, To Barrington, N.H.

Dursts January 2010 revised plans would allow for 624 homes (572 in Pine Plains and 52 in Milan).(Pine Plains United)By 2002 Red Wing Sand and Gravel of Fishkill, New York had bought two large parcels in the northern part of the Milan ( on Turkey Hill Road and  on Academy Hill Road) with a view to operating two large-scale mines.  But on March 30, 2010 the Supreme Court of the State of New York ruled in favor of the Town of Milan and its town-wide ban on mining.(Supreme Court of the State of New York Appellate Division: Second Judicial Department)  The town was defended successfully by the office of the New York State Attorney General, preventing the mining company from proceeding to develop mines at those locations.DemographicsThe 2000 Census was corrected due to an error in the total population count of Milan. Corrected population counts result from a process called the Count Question Resolution Program. Milans total  population in 2000 was 2,356, not 4,559 as originally reported. Due to the original error in total population, The US Census Bureau corrected four categories; Total Population, Total Housing Units, Vacant Housing Units and Group Quarters Population. They failed to correct any other data rendering the 2000 Census useless for demographic study. The resulting demographic data cited below is from the 2000 Census with almost all of it being incorrect.As of the census of 2000, there were 4,559 people, 882 households, and 612 families residing in the town.

Fort_Montgomery,_New_York
Fort Montgomery is a hamlet (and place) in Orange County, York, States. The population was 1,418 at the 2000 census.  It is part of the Poughkeepsie&ndash;Newburgh&ndash;Middletown, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New York&ndash;Newark&ndash;Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area. Fort Montgomery is in the southeast corner of the Town of Highlands, on Route 9W. GeographyFort Montgomery is on the west bank of the River. Fort Montgomery is located at  (41.337469, -73.982746).According to the States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which,  of it is land and  of it (2.00%) is water.HistoryThe town is named after the first Montgomery, a fortification of the Revolution, stormed by the British on October 6, 1777. Although a loss for American forces, the battle delayed the British from sailing up the Hudson River in time to relieve Burgoynes forces at Saratoga. After the demolition of the fort, American defenses centered on Point, New York, upriver, and the location was not re-used militarily.The town subsequently became the site of a major ore dock. Ore from the Forest of Dean Mine was shipped via a railroad and an tramway to the dock, where it was loaded into steamboats on the Hudson. Coal for the mine machinery travelled in the opposite direction. Some ore was also mined in the immediate vicinity of Fort Montgomery. The Shore Railroad was constructed through the town in the early 1880s.Local mining activity was relatively ephemeral, and the large Forest of Dean Mine was shut down in 1931. With the loss of its main industry, the town sank into decline, accelerated by the end of railroad passenger service in 1958.Today the hamlet is a well known stop on the trail due to the close proximity to the trail of its post office, food, and lodging.DemographicsAs of the census of 2000, there were 1,418 people, 574 households, and 393 families residing in the CDP. The density was 965.0 per square mile (372.4/km). There were 611 housing units at an average density of 415.8/sq mi (160.5/km).

Rosendale_Village,_New_York
footnotes                 Rosendale Village is a hamlet and place within the town of Rosendale in Ulster County, York, States, with a population of roughly 1,500 people. The area was originally settled in the late 17th century by Jacob Rutsen, a merchant from Albany, but did not become a major population center until the 1825 discovery of cement in the region; the development of the cement industry, and the growth of the and Hudson Canal along the Creek and Main Street, gave rise to substantial economic development in Rosendale. The towns cement was used in the construction of numerous national landmarks. The Valley Railroad reached the village in 1871, and its depot in the village was the largest station on the Wallkill Valley line. Rosendale was formally incorporated as a village in 1890.An 1895 fire destroyed half the village, as it had no form of protection at that time. Throughout the 20th century, the decline of the natural cement industry caused Rosendale to suffer economically and lose population. The village was also battered by a series of severe floods, and the center of commerce began to shift from Main Street to Route 32. By the 1970s the village was having severe problems with its utilities and tax code, and was no longer producing cement. The hippie movement brought many artists to the village during this time, which lead to ideological clashes between the newcomers and the more conservative, established residents. In 1976, the village voted to dissolve itself to solve its municipal problems, and on January 1, 1978, Rosendale became disincorporated. The villages mayor at the time of the vote viewed the dissolution as a work of art, and published a book on the matter.After the disincorporation, the commercial center of the former village was revitalized by artists and entrepreneurs, who purchased and restored Main Street buildings that had fallen into disrepair. Since the 1990s, Rosendale has hosted many street festivals. The former village has had a number of notable buildings, including four churches. Two notable bridges span the Rondout Creek in the village: a road bridge that carries Route 32, and the trestle, a former railroad bridge currently being renovated as a pedestrian walkway. Mountain, named after Rosendales founder, borders the village and has been the site of numerous jumping competitions and mine collapses. History  Early settlement The earliest recorded human habitation in Rosendale was a Native American village, which included a cemetery, centered around a spring that no longer exists. The first person of European descent to settle the Rosendale area was a merchant from Albany, Jacob Rutsen (originally Jacobsen Rutger van Schoonderwoerdt).( Rutsen received a patent on October 8, 1677, for a  tract of land, located in what is now Rosendale, after purchasing it from a local Indian named Anckerop. Anckerop agreed to the sale on the condition that he be allowed, the right to plant ... maize annually for the duration of his life, and that Rutsen would plow the involved fields.Dirck (also spelled Direk() Keyser secured a lease to the land from Rutsen on June 17, 1680, and built the first house in Rosendale; the terms of Keysers lease stipulated that he build a stone house on the property( at the base of what is now Joppenbergh Mountain. On June 23, 1682, fifteen members of the tribe sold Rutsen more land, by the Rondout Creek. This land was surveyed by Philip Wells on May 28, 1685;( Wells declared the size of the purchase to be  south of the creek, and  to the north. There was also a  island within the creek. Rutsen was given a patent for the combined area on August 26, 1686.In 1700, Rutsen took the house from Keyser and expanded it.() The settlement was known as Rosendall as early as 1700, and was also called Roasendale in documents as early as May 28, 1685.( The name is thought to be either a reference to wild roses growing throughout the region, or of Dutch origin, as the word existed in period documents from Holland.() After Rutsens death in 1730, he was buried in the area which eventually became the village. His tombstone eulogizes him as the Founder of Rosendale.The village remained sparsely populated and only consisted of two houses when the and Hudson Canal reached it after the materials used to manufacture cement, named after the town, were discovered locally in 1825.() Early settlers had avoided the area because the northern land, comprising present-day Rosendale Village, was a known floodplain, and the lands south of the creek were less mountainous and at a higher elevation. Industrial growth Ulster County Atlas Page085.jpg|thumb|right|A lithograph depicting the New York and Rosendale Cement CompanyThe 1825 dolostone deposit was the single largest natural cement deposit in the United States, encompassing  between High Falls and Kingston. The cement was used in the construction of the canal and quickly became the primary impetus for the town to grow and prosper.By 1835 the village contained a hydraulic cement plant, a post office, tavern, and several stores and houses. When the surrounding town of Rosendale was created from parts of Hurley, New Paltz and Marbletown on April 26, 1844, the village was referred to by the same name as the town. On December 7, 1847, New York passed a law which allowed the municipal incorporation of villages within the state.() The Valley Railroad was opened to Rosendale in 1871, with the trestle across the Creek completed the following year. James S. McEntee, a former Delaware and Hudson engineer, was the only person to have seen the opening of both the canal and the trestle.() The Rosendale station was the largest depot on the Wallkill Valley rail line.() Unlike the other stations on the line, it was designed to have an L shape, rather than being rectangular, because the building was squeezed by the severe slope behind it. In 1888, a pinkeye outbreak killed off many horses in Rosendale and along the canal.()Rosendale was sung about in a canal-related folk song in the 1880s called Sari Jane. The villages cement mines were mentioned in a poem by D. Taylor, Carrying Coal On The D & H Canal, and another poem, Trip Down The Canal, by DeWitt E. Clinton and his wife. An 1840 painting by James Smilie depicting Rosendale was one of the earliest paintings to feature the canal.The village was formally incorporated in 1890.() Rosendale cement was used in the construction of several national monuments, such as the Bridge, the Monument, Central Terminal, and parts of the of Liberty and the States Capitol. At its peak Rosendale had fourteen bars on the same  street,( while the local cement industry employed 5,000 people and was producing four million barrels of cement each year.( Decline and disasters A fire destroyed half the village in 1895, burning 26 buildings and causing more than $125,000 in damage. The village had no form of protection, though there had been an attempt prior to the fire to establish such a utility. Ironically, those who were the heaviest losers by the fire were the ones who worked hardest to defeat the movement.() About 10,000 people came to Rosendale following the fire to look at the charred remains, packing the village in a scene of an old-time country fair.() In 1900, the village attempted to purchase a water plant for $40,000.() The New York & Rosendale Cement Company sued to prevent bonding for the purchase. Before the case could reach the York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, the village elected a new board of trustees, which attempted to block the purchase. They were unsuccessful() and the village was forced to complete the purchase in 1903.( The village enacted an ordinance in December 1901 to remove snow, ice and dirt from local gutters and sidewalks.() Power lines were built throughout the village in 1906.()A strawberry and ice cream festival was held at Rosendales Episcopal church on June 12, 1906.() Around this time the village had an annual firemens parades, which included athletic events,( such as baseball and of war,() as well as bands, dances,() and speeches. Several different fire companies from throughout the region were involved in the parades.()Rosendale Station cropped.jpg|thumb|left|The Rosendale rail depot, once the largest on the Wallkill Valley line, was destroyed in a 1923 fireBy 1910, the canal running through Rosendale had closed. On July 5, 1911, the Jacob Rutsen house was hit by lightning and destroyed in a severe storm. The increased industrial use of cement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was detrimental to Rosendales economy. Between 1900 and 1920 the village lost almost 70 percent of its population,() and only one cement factory remained open after 1920. In April 1923, the Rosendale railroad depot and its freight house were destroyed in a fire.(The village suffered a severe flood in August 1928. Several feet of floodwater reached the first floors of buildings on Main Street, and the Kingston Fire Department sent boats to rescue stranded residents.() In many houses, muddy and slimy water had filled the cellar to the top step of the cellar stairway. Driveways had been washed out and planking was put down so that pumps could remove the water.() Other major floods occurred in March 1936,( August 1955,() and October 1955.() The water was as high as  above the level of the street during the 1955 floods.( In October 1956, a dinner reception was held to honor the government leaders and flood control officers who had coordinated rescue efforts during the previous years floods.()The village petitioned the state for a census recount in 1957 in an attempt to secure additional state aid. The recount was performed in March 1957() and showed that the villages population had increased 16 percent since the 1950 census. The village received additional state aid.() In December 1963 the federal government approved a $100,000 appropriation for control projects along the Rondout Creek in the town of Rosendale; the plan included changes to the shape of the creek itself and raising a section of villages Main Street to the level of Route 32.(On a clear, sunny day in July 1964, a group of six boys went swimming in the Roundout Creek at a park in Rosendale Village. After getting out of the creek, the boys were struck by lightning. One boy was knocked back into the creek, and regained consciousness as he was being pulled out. Two of the boys, Gary Schmitt and Ronald Morelli, died. Ronald Morelli was the son of Albert Morelli,() who served as Rosendales chief. Albert Morelli was part of the team that put out the fire at Reids Village Inn.()Rosendale had lost its bowling alley to a 1967 fire,() and, on January 14, 1969, a local hotel burned down. The hotel, Reids Village Inn, was owned by village mayor Joseph Reid.() Reid and his wife lived in the building, and lost all their possessions in the fire. Total damage was estimated to be between $50,000() and $75,000.( Within two days of the blaze, the village purchased a fire truck and scheduled hearings for parking and meter proposals.( By this time, the Army Corps of Engineers had built a  wall, relocated several buildings, dredged the bottom of the creek, and raised a  portion of Main Street about .( The project caused the  island in the creek to become a peninsula, connected to the northern bank. Since the completion of these projects, the village has not suffered floods as extreme as those of 1955.()File:Rosendale lime kiln 5.jpg|thumb|right|Defunct Rosendale kilns; the last cement plant in the town closed in 1971In 1970, Rosendales mayor ran off after declaring that the village had gone broke.( The commercial center of the village was shifting from Main Street (concurrent with Route 213) to Route 32; businesses on Route 32 included a store, butcher shop, salon, barbershop, and restaurants. The village itself served as the commercial center of the town.() The growth of shopping malls in nearby Kingston put many local stores out of business, and the last cement plant in Rosendale closed in 1971;() abandoned cement mines were eventually used by mushrooms growers( who produced their crops on beds of horse manure. Large piles of the manure were visible along Binnewater Road. The caves were also used to acquire naturally filtered water, maintain corn at a consistently cool temperature,() and house a records storage facility.()The  storage facility, operated by Mountain Incorporated,() consists of lights amid two-story buildings, all erected beneath the old limestone caves leased from the Snyder Estate( for 99 years. It was opened for a public viewing in 1976 to quell rumors( that the heavily guarded facility, described as a subterranean Bond set,() was part of an underground cave network that connected the village to Kingston, and that the facility was actually a shelter for federal officials;() the facility is capable of withstanding a direct atomic hit on nearby Poughkeepsie. Sealed behind a  steel door, the facility contains its own well and ... sewage system, and enough generators to remain self-sufficient for three months. Reign of Billy Guldy The man who suggested that the underground facility have a public exhibition was a local personality, Billy Guldy.( Guldy was born around 1940 in Kingston, and, by the 1970s, had become a leading figure in Rosendale Villages hippie movement. He declared himself a king,( and frequently dressed as one. He owned a bar called The Well,() and a hotel in the village,() and his portrait was painted on the door of a local bar. He declared Halloween a national holiday, ran for president, and led 200 people in a parade down Main Street.( At one point Guldy took a bus to Stadium to give baseball player Fred Stanley the key to Rosendale.( Some older residents considered Guldy crazy,( and former village trustee Harold Schoonmaker felt theres something wrong with a man that walks around the streets barefoot, wearing a robe and derby. The villages children viewed Guldy favorably and were quite friendly with him.(Some of the villages more traditional residents felt overwhelmed by the influx of beatniks, and locals were conflicted over whether Rosendales transformation into an colony would benefit the village in the long term.( A major clash between the hippies and village police occurred at a bar on June 21, 1975, causing over 150 people to show up to see what was going on.( Although there were many people actively involved in the riot, only Guldy was charged.(A group that opposed the hippie movement managed to keep Guldy off the mayoral ballot in 1975. He became a candidate for village trustee, with his friend, poet George Montgomery, running for mayor. Montgomery lost the election to Raivo Puusemp, a sculptor from SoHo. After his election, Puusemp chided Guldy for being a poor model for the village youth.( Puusemp was not a native of Rosendale and had not lived there long. By early July 1975, Puusemp had appointed a village dog warden after a dog bit a child and was allowed to run about the streets unrestrained.() Disincorporation When Puusemp, a artist and art instructor at SUNY Ulster, became mayor of Rosendale, the village was plagued by an overbearing tax structure and problems with its municipal utilities. Though disincorporation was already known as a possible solution to the villages crises, it had been an emotionally charged issue and no action had been taken. By this time Rosendale could longer govern itself. The village and town governments had often been at odds; the town was governed by Republicans while the village was increasingly under Democratic control. This friction manifested in several ways. Town and village officials would frequently disrupt each others meetings, and the town ordered its snow plows to raise their blades while passing through the village; the village subsequently bought its own plow and banned the towns plow from entering village limits.()During his campaign, Puusemp did not mention disincorporation or how it related to art, though he had already decided two months before the election that the only solution to the villages problems was disincorporation. In some of Puusemps early artworks (termed influence pieces), he would manipulate subjects into unknowingly executing his ideas while believing that they, the subjects, had come up with said ideas on their own.()Viewing the project as an artwork in the form of a political problem, Puusemp convinced the people of Rosendale to disincorporate by publicly comparing the villages finances to what would be needed to maintain a viable town. The villages board of trustees strongly favored dissolution and forced three separate votes before reaching a 179 to 87 majority to abolish the village. A public referendum on the dissolution was held on March 16, 1976,( which passed in a 21 landslide.( Puusemp resigned as mayor on October 1, and moved to Utah with his family.( He vowed never to run for office again.( During his tenure in office, and in the aftermath of his resignation, Puusemp received widespread popular support.Mark Phelan, a village trustee and associate of Puusemp, became mayor following Puusemps departure. Rosendale became unincorporated on January 1, 1977,( though the village government did not disband until the end of 1977;( the village completely ceased to exist at the stroke of midnight on Dec. 31, 1977.() Ironically, the state and federal government provided funding for new sewage and water systems following the disincorporation, mitigating the primary reasons residents had voted to dissolve.(Puusemp documented the dissolution by collecting press clippings, council meeting minutes, and public documents and publishing them after his friend, performance artist McCarthy, urged him to do so. Both the book and the dissolution of Rosendale Village itself can be considered different facets of the same artistic work. The 1980 census listed Rosendale Village as a place (CDP).() The former village is also considered a hamlet, an unofficial term which refers to a named but unincorporated place in New York.() Rosendale Village is the largest bloc in the town of Rosendale,( and of all former villages in the Valley, Rosendale was the last to dissolve.() Modern Rosendale After the villages disincorporation, taxes decreased for former village residents, but increased for Rosendale residents throughout the rest of the town. The population of the former village has grown 24.5 percent, from 1,220 to an estimated 1,519 people.()( The same year that the village chose to disincorporate, the Wallkill Valley rail line that ran through the village also ceased regular service.The revitalization of businesses in the former village was credited to the influx of artists. Prior to the 1980s, store owners in Rosendale Village had either retired or died, and their shops had become residential or simply abandoned. Newcomers purchased these properties, restored them, and returned them to commercial service.()Widow Jane Mine, a horizontal mine that has hosted concertsOn September 13, 1991, the Century House Historical Society was formed to preserve historical sites within Rosendale, and to promote research on such sites. The York State Education Department granted a permanent charter to the organization on June 13, 2000.() The Society held a concert in one of the former cement mines, the Widow Jane Mine, around 2002; the concert caused severe traffic and presented a fire hazard, and the society was subsequently sued by the town.( The Widow Jane Mine has been the site of all-night raves, Halloween horror shows and role-playing vampire games.() It is also one of the few mines in Rosendale that is almost completely horizontal,() and is part of the Estate Natural Cement Historic District.()Since 1998, Rosendale has held an annual pickle festival.() Some people view the pickle festival as a form of social expression, and the current artisan pickling scene has been compared to the mentality of early microbreweries.() The pickle festival was originally started by Eri Yamaguchi and Bill Brooks,() as a way to introduce Ulster County to pickled Japanese food, such as oshinko.() The festival has featured Japanese traditional dancing.() At the first pickle festival the number of people attending was 1,000, a number five times greater than expected. The following year it was double that, and by 2003, attendance was almost 5,000.() Rosendale has had a recurring winter festival known as Frozendale,()() and in late September 2010, the hamlet had a zombie-themed festival.() Historically, the former villages street festivals have drawas many as 30,000 people.( Geography and geology File:Rosendale Village quadrangle crop.jpg|thumb|right|A 1980 map of Rosendale VillageRosendale Village has a total area of , of which  is land and  is water. The former village is located at the center of the town of Rosendale, and is situated on the Delaware and Hudson canal and Creek, about  north of the creeks confluence with the River.( The highest recorded crest of the Rondout Creek in Rosendale was  on October 16, 1955. The creek does not normally rise above , but overflows its banks after reaching .() The hamlets code is 12472 and it is in code 845.() Rosendale Village is bordered by the creek and by the  Joppenbergh Mountain.() It is traversed by state routes NY 32 and NY 213. The former village is  east of the hamlet of High Falls,  north of the village of New Paltz, and  south of the city of Kingston.()Rosendale is underlain by a shale member of the Formation called Martinburg shale, deposited as early as 500 million years ago; Martinburg shale also lines the bottom of the Rondout Creek as it flows through the town. A conglomerate of the Formation was deposited over the Martinburg layer approximately 425 million years ago. The conglomerate is in turn covered by Falls Shale, a reddish shale formed by mud flats. Subsequent streams left a layer of gray Sandstone above the shale. After the sandstone was deposited, the region experienced folding and faulting, and was submerged in a shallow sea. This allowed the creation of fossiliferous limestone roughly 390 million years ago, specifically the Formation and Scotland Formation. The Rondout Formations dolostone member, formed during the upper Silurian,( was mined throughout the village because of its ability to form natural cement. The region experienced repeated glaciation, and large amounts of till and alluvium were deposited during the glaciation. Climate There is more precipitation during May than in any other month; Rosendale currently has an annual precipitation of about .() Between 1931 and 1955, the town averaged  each year. July is the hottest month, on average; the hottest recorded temperature occurred during July 1995. January is the coldest month, and the lowest recorded temperature was taken in January 1961.( Landmarks  Churches NY - Dutch Reformed Church - Belltower Lighting.jpg|thumb|left|The former Dutch Reformed church, now a glass studioRosendale Village has had four churches throughout its existence: a Baptist, Dutch Reformed, Catholic and Episcopal church. Of these churches, only the Catholic one still functions as a church.()The first Baptist minister arrived in Rosendale in March 1839, and the first baptisms took place on April 5, 1840. The First Associate Baptist Society in the Village of Rosendale was incorporated on May 22, 1840. A meeting house for the society was built in 1842; it was dedicated on October 17 and its pews were purchased on November 4. The church underwent a revival between 1875 and 1876, and was reincorporated on May 1, 1876, as the Baptist Church of Rosendale. It was closed as a church in 1929, and sold in 1972 to a local filmmaker, Walter Helmuth, who used it as a house.( At some point it housed a fraternal organization of farmers and was known as the Grange. In the 1990s it was used as a theater. On January 15, 2004, the building burned down. Though the towns station was directly across the street, the extreme cold hindered firefighters efforts to control the fire.()The Protestant Reformed Dutch Church of Rosendale was incorporated on November 28, 1843. The church originally cost $2,500 to build, and was designed to seat 300 people. It burned down and was rebuilt in 1895.( In 1985, it was renovated and converted into a glass studio called Belltower Lighting.(Catholic priests had come to Rosendale as early as 1840, and the first mass in the village was held in a coopers shop. The original Church of St. Peter was completed in the summer of 1850, and the first mass in that building was held on August 15. The church was not officially incorporated until April 29, 1865. A newer, larger building was constructed in 1876, on the same road as the villages rail depot. The new building followed an Gothic architecture style. It was made of bricks, created near the North River, and was ornamented with yellow bricks from Amboy, New Jersey, and sandstone from New York. The first mass in the new church occurred on December 25, 1876; the buildings total construction cost was $31,000. The Church of St. Peter is the only one of the villages churches that still functions as a church.(Rosendales Episcopal church, the All Saints Chapel, was built in 1876.( It was hit hard by the floods of 1955, to the point where the rising water floated the organ up toward the altar.( It was abandoned after the flooding, and was purchased by a local cement magnate, so that it could be converted into the Library; the library association had its charter granted on October 24, 1958. The building was severely damaged by a fire on January 15, 1975, but was restored, and a new wing was added; the wing was named after Anna Mae Auchmoedy, the buildings first librarian. In 1986, the library was listed on the Register of Historic Places.() Joppenbergh Mountain File:Rosendale railroad bridge and Joppenbergh.jpg|thumb|right|Mountain, depicted next to the hamlets railroad trestleJoppenbergh is a  mountain, adjacent to the hamlets railroad trestle and Route 213. It was named after Rosendales founder, Jacob Rutsen,( and mined throughout the late 19th century for the dolostone that was used in the manufacture of cement.

It was repeatedly reinforced throughout its existence.() When Conrail closed the Wallkill Valley line in 1977, the stability of the trestle had been one of its primary reasons for doing so. Conrail had tried to sell the bridge as early as 1983, and in 1986 the trestle was sold to a private businessman, John Rahl, for one dollar.()Rahl installed decking on half of the trestle between 1989 and 1991, attempting to open it as a jumping platform.

Haileyville,_Oklahoma
footnotes                Haileyville is a city in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma, States. The population was 891 at the 2000 census.Located in Pittsburg County, Haileyville lies at the junction of U.S. Highway 270/State Highway 1 and State Highway 63, fourteen miles east of McAlester and a little more than one mile west of Hartshorne. The French explorer Jean Baptiste Bnard de La Harpe first mapped the site of Haileyville in 1719 during his expedition to the Arkansas River. In 1898 D. M. Hailey, M.D., established the town of Haileyville, when he claimed a tract of land east of McAlester and opened the areas first coal mines. A confederate veteran, Hailey had first moved into Indian Territory in 1868 to practice medicine and before long had become involved in several business ventures. His mining investments began when he and James Elliot started the Hailey-Ola Mining Company, leasing coal land from the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad, which laid tracks in the area in 1889-90. The first mine, named Number One Slope, began production on St. Patricks Day in 1899.Haileyville, in the Choctaw Nation, was a company town, which was a common feature of coal-mining communities. Italians, American Indians, Russians, and Americans comprised most of Haileyville, and many worked in the mines or on the railroads. Coal from the area was only profitable due to the railroad junction. The town was home to the freight and passenger offices of the Choctaw, Oklahoma, and Gulf Railroad, which later became the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Company (Rock Island). By 1902 the railroad had 1,052 miles of track, including a branch from the town that ran to Ardmore. Haileyville remained the division point of the Rock Island Railroad until 1958, when the offices moved to El Reno.On April 20, 1901, the U.S. Post Office Department designated a Haileyville post office. The 1907 population stood at 1,452, and it climbed to 2,024 in 1910. In 1911 a bank, the New State newspaper, five hotels, three doctors, and several retail and other businesses served the residents. The community and its close neighbor, Hartshorne, are known as the twin cities of Pittsburg County due to their proximity. Gov. Lee Cruce proclaimed Haileyville a first class city on February 12, 1912. After a 2,067 population in 1920, the number of residents declined to 1,801 in 1930, 1,183 in 1940, and 922 in 1960. In 1946 one coal company, a bank, and an ice plant were the main businesses, with gas stations, grocery stores, and a hardware store. After the coal mines closed, lumber, farming, and ranching became the primary modes of production.GeographyHaileyville is located at .

Cheswick,_Pennsylvania
Cheswick is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, States. The population was 1,746 at the 2010 census.()HistoryCheswick, named for a town in England, is a small town of about . The history of the lands of Cheswick seems to have belonged to the Keen family at least in part, for Archie Pillow, or Pillar, as spelled in old records, inherited land from the Keen family.  That land, in part, is where Cheswick is today.  Archies brother, George, once owned the second oldest house in the community.  Thomas Pillow owned the land from Highland Avenue to the Harmar Township line.The level land near the River was used as farmland (Borland farm). Borland & Truck farms sold vegetables to Pittsburgh in the days of the canal.  Barges and rafts of lumber were floated down the river to the steel mills.  The men were fed by women who took baked goods out to the slow-moving barges in boats. In the days of the canal, wealthy families built great Victorian houses along the canal.  Later, when the railroad bought out the right of way, the noise and dust became disturbing and many houses became run down and neglected.Among the early names are Borland, Pillows, Macleans, Wilsons, Stewarts, Lemons, Albertsons, Buntings, Cummings, Shoops and Armstrongs.  The Armstrong family lived in Acmetonia until after the Civil War. One built the fine stone house next to the Cheswick Theater, and he served as postmaster in the borough.Before the days of the railroad, a tavern was located where the former station would later be built.  People traveling to Pittsburgh by carriage probably stopped for refreshment. The road between Pittsburgh and Freeport was filled by farmers driving cattle to market in Pittsburgh, peddler wagons taking goods to country housewives, businessmen going to Pittsburgh, and officials going to court for the day. When the Railroad was completed, the land was divided and sold in sections and lots.  For a time, few were sold and growth was slow.  The town name became Lincoln but had to be changed, for there were other communities by the same name. It was not until 1902 that the name Cheswick was adopted at the first council meeting. The streets were named for trees, such as Beech, Pine and Spruce.  The President of the Council was H.J. Hutchinson. The second ordinance dealt with the public health of the community. Houses, sewage, garbage, slaughterhouses were considered and fines stated.  Later ordinances provided for paved streets and sidewalks.One of the first industries was the Penwick Distillery. In a large brick building, the liquor was stored for years before it was sold.  Several small factories were built, but coal, river sand and gravel were the most important.  Many of the residents traveled by train each day to work in offices and stores. The Cheswick Fire Department was founded in the early 1900s.In early times, the children went to school near Deer Creek in Harmar Township.  Later, a school was built on Pittsburgh Road not far from the site of the old Cheswick elementary school.  The Borough Council met in the school building at that time, and all of its papers were kept there.  In 1919, fire destroyed the interior of the old school, burning most of the records of the young borough of Cheswick.  A newer and bigger Cheswick School was planned under the Allegheny Valley Joint Schools expansion program.  Today, the old elementary school is part of the Cheswick Christian Academy.The Church was originally part of the old church built in 1804 on the Denny farm.  Around 1873, Mathew Maclean donated land for the Presbyterian Church, and it was built at a cost of $2,441.01 with a membership of seventeen.  The Reverend James Boyd was an early minister of the Presbyterian faith who served the community.One of the worst mining disasters in history occurred at the Coal Company Mine Explosion in Cheswick on January 25, 1904, killing almost 200 men.GeographyCheswick is located at  (40.541723, -79.800348).According to the States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which  is land and , or 15.79%, is water.Surrounding communitiesCheswick is bordered by Acmetonia in Harmar Township on the west, by Springdale Township on the north, by Springdale Borough on the east, and by Plum Borough on the south (across the River).DemographicsAs of the census of 2000, there were 1,899 people, 853 households, and 590 families residing in the borough.

Emmaboda_Municipality
 footnotes                Emmaboda Municipality (Emmaboda kommun) is a municipality in County, in south-eastern Sweden. Its seat is located in the town Emmaboda.The present municipality was formed in 1971, when the market town (kping) of Emmaboda (itself instituted in 1930) was amalgamated with three surrounding rural municipalities.GeographyThe municipality borders to the municipalities of Nybro, Kalmar and Torss in Kalmar County; to Karlskrona and Ronneby in County; and Tingsryd and Lessebo in County. The nearest cities in its vicinity are Kalmar (pop. 35,170), Karlskrona (pop. 32,606), Vxj (pop. 55,600), and Nybro (pop. 12,598).It is part of Glasriket, The Realm of Glass, where people have been producing glass products at least since the 17th century, and transported them to the rest of Sweden. The glassworks in Emmaboda municipality are mainly Johansfors, fors and Boda, the latter being one part of the supplier for the glass sculpturer Boda.Those interested in nature activities will find many opportunities of fishing in the many lakes and streams stretching through the municipality.LocalitiesThere are 6 urban areas (also called a ttort or locality) in Emmaboda Municipality.In the table the localities are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters.CultureThe Emigrants, the works about the emigration to North America, written by Moberg that have spread around the world have put a focus on many places in the municipality mentioned in the novels. Moberg himself was born on a farm just north-west of the town Emmaboda in 1898, where a monument stone now stands since 1970. Nearby is also a small museum about the author. Duvemla, the village where Karl Oskar and Kristina, the fictional main characters of the novels live, is also located in the municipality.Historically, the dense forests in this area were a centre for Dackes rebellion fights against King Vasa in the 16th century, causing the king great troubles for a while, until he sent down troops gathered from the other of Sweden.

Scranton,_Pennsylvania
 footnotes Scranton is a city in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania, States. It is the seat of Lackawanna County and the largest principal city in the metropolitan area. Scranton had a population of 76,089 in 2010, according to the U.S. Census, making it Pennsylvanias sixth-most-populous city after Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Allentown, Erie, and Reading.()Scranton is the geographic and cultural center of the River valley, and the largest of the former coal mining communities in a contiguous quilt-work that also includes Wilkes-Barre, Pittston, and Carbondale. Scranton was incorporated as a borough on February 14, 1856, and as a city on April 23, 1866.HistoryHumble beginnings (17761845)Present-day Scranton and its surrounding area had been inhabited by the native Lenape tribe, from whose language Lackawanna (or le-can-hanna, meaning stream that forks) is derived. In 1778, Isaac Tripp, known as the areas first white settler, built his home here; it still stands in the citys Providence section. More settlers from England came to the area in the late 18th century, gradually establishing mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as Slocum Hollow.Industrial foundation established: iron, coal and railroads (18461899)Image:George Inness 003.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Scranton in 1855, as depicted by Innesss painting of the Lackawanna and Western Railroad roundhouse.thumb|300px|right|Scranton, as depicted on an 1890 panoramic map Though coal was being mined in Carbondale to the north and Wilkes-Barre to the south, the industries that precipitated the citys growth were iron and steel. In 1840, brothers Selden T. and W. Scranton founded what would become the Steel Company. On October 8, 1845, the Montour Iron Works in Pennsylvania, produced the first iron T-rails made in America, offering the first domestic competition to English exports. The Scrantons firm followed suit two years later, making rails for the Railroad in New York state, and soon became a major producer.In 1851, the Scrantons founded the Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W) to transport iron and coal products from the Lackawanna valley. The Pennsylvania Coal Company built a railroad here for the same purpose. In 1856, the Borough of Scranton was officially incorporated. The and Hudson (D&H) Canal Company, which had its own gravity railroad from Carbondale to Honesdale, built a railroad that entered Scranton in 1863.Scranton was incorporated as a city of 35,000 in 1866 in Luzerne County when the surrounding boroughs of Hyde Park (now part of the citys West Side) and Providence (now part of North Scranton) were merged with Scranton. Twelve years later, the city became the county seat of the newly formed Lackawanna County. The nations first successful, continuously operating electrified streetcar (trolley) system was established in the city in 1886, giving it the nickname The Electric City. In the late 1890s Scranton was home to a series of early League baseball teams. By 1890, three other railroads had built lines to tap into the rich supply of coal in and around the city, including the Erie Railroad, the Railroad of New Jersey and finally the York, Ontario and Western Railway (NYO&W). Underneath the city, a network of coal veins was mined by workers who were given jobs by the wealthy coal barons with low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions. Children as young as 8 or 9 worked 14-hour days separating slate from coal in the breakers.Growth and prosperity (19001945)By the States Census of 1900, the population of Scranton was about 102,026, making it the 38th largest city in the United States.()The turn of the 20th century saw many beautiful homes of architecture built in the Hill and Green Ridge sections of the city. In 1901, the dwindling local iron ore supply took the Lackawanna Steel Company away to New York, where iron ore from Minnesota was more readily available by ships on the Great Lakes. The city lost the industry on which it was founded.Scranton forged ahead as the center of Pennsylvanias anthracite coal industry. During the first half of the 20th century, it became home to many groups of newly arrived immigrants from Europe. This patchwork still survives and is represented by the Catholic and Orthodox churches that primarily dot the North Scranton, West Side, and South Side neighborhoods of the city; a substantial Jewish community was established as well. In 1903, an electric interurban railroad known as the Line was started, and two years later connected to nearby Wilkes-Barre,  to the southwest. Working conditions for miners were improved by the efforts of labor leaders like John Mitchell, who is honored with a statue on the downtown Courthouse Square.Starting the early 1920s, the Button Company (founded in 1885 and a major maker of shellac buttons) became one of the primary makers of phonograph records. They pressed records for Emerson (whom they bought in 1924), as well as Regal, Cameo, Romeo, Banner, Domino, Conqueror, and after merging with Regal, Cameo, Banner, and the US branch of Pathe (makers of Pathe and Perfect) in July, 1929, became the Record Corporation. From that point until 1938, Scranton also added Brunswick, Melotone, and Vocalion to their production schedule. In 1946, the company was acquired by Capitol (who continued to produce Capitol Records through the end of the vinyl era).By the mid-1930s, the city population had swelled to over 140,000( due to the extensive growth of the mining and silk textile industries. War II created a great demand for energy, which was satisfied by expanded mining operations throughout the area.Image:Washington Avenue, Scranton, PA.jpg|Washington Ave. in 1907Image:Burning Culm Dump, Scranton, PA.jpg|Burning culm dump c. 1908Image:Old Post Office, Scranton, PA.jpg|Old post office in 1911The end of an era (19461984)After World War II, coal lost favor to oil and gas. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and Luzerne Counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s. In 1952, the Laurel Line ceased passenger service. The Scranton Transit Company, whose trolleys had given the city its nickname, transferred all operations to buses as the 1954 holiday season approached. In 1955, some eastern and southern parts of the city were destroyed by the floods of Diane, and 80 lives were lost. The NYO&W Railroad, which depended heavily on its Scranton branch for freight traffic, was abandoned in 1957.The Mine Disaster of January 1959 all but erased the mining industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The event eliminated thousands of jobs as the waters of the River flooded the mines.()() The DL&W Railroad, nearly bankrupt by the drop in coal traffic and the effects of Hurricane Diane, merged with the Erie Railroad in 1960. Scranton had been the hub of its operations until the Lackawanna merger, when it was no longer needed in this capacity; it was another severe blow to the labor market. Mine subsidence was a spreading problem in the city as pillar supports in abandoned mines began to fail; cave-ins sometimes consumed entire blocks of homes. The area was then scarred by abandoned coal mining structures, strip mines, and massive dumps. During the 1960s and 1970s, the silk and other textile industries shrunk as jobs moved south or overseas.thumb|The Globe Store, near Wyoming and Lackawanna Ave., 1978There were some small bright spots during the era. In 1962, businessman Grass opened his first Thrif D Discount Center drugstore on Lackawanna Avenue in downtown Scranton.()( ) The  store, an immediate success, was the progenitor of the Aid drugstore chain.(During the 1970s and 1980s, many downtown storefronts and theaters became vacant as suburban shopping malls became the dominant venues for shopping and entertainment.Stabilization and restoration (1985present)thumb|Historic Electric City sign, restored in 2008, shines again.There has been an emphasis on revitalization since the mid-1980s. Local government and much of the community at large have adopted a renewed interest in the citys buildings and history. Aged and empty properties are being redesigned and marketed as tourist attractions. The National Historic Site captures the areas once-prominent position in the railroad industry. The former DL&W train station was restored as the Lackawanna Station Hotel. The City Trolley Museum was created next to the DL&W yards that the Steamtown NHS occupies. Other attractions responsible for recent popularity and favorable attention to the Scranton area include the Mountain ski resort (formerly Montage Mountain), the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, AHL affiliate of the Penguins, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees (formerly the Red Barons), AAA affiliate of the York Yankees, and their Field, and the Pavilion at Montage Mountain concert venue.Image:Courthouse_Square.JPG|Courthouse SquareImage:Scranton_Electric_Building.JPG|Scranton Electric BuildingImage:Scranton_City_Hall.JPG|Scranton City HallImage:St._Peter%27s_Cathedral.JPG|St. Peters CathedralImage:Electric_City_Mural.JPG|Electric City MuralImage:First_Liberty_Building.JPG|First Liberty BuildingImage:Scranton_Post_Office.JPG|US Post Office and Federal BuildingImage:Brooks_Building.JPG|Brooks BuildingImage:Downtown_Scranton_at_night.JPG|Downtown Scranton at nightImage:Scranton_Times_building.JPG|Scranton Times BuildingGeographyScranton is located at  (41.410629, 75.667411).

Freeland,_Pennsylvania
Freeland, originally called Birbeckville after founder Joseph Birkbeck, then South Heberton, is a borough in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania,  south of Wilkes-Barre, and 10 miles northeast of Hazleton in an agricultural region. Freeland was officially incorporated as a borough on September 11, 1876. Coal-mining was a chief industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. At the turn of the century the population numbered 5,254. By 1910 it had increased to 6,197, and in 1940 it peaked at 6,593 residents. At the 2000 census, the population was 3,643. As of 30 September 2010, the current Mayor of Freeland is Mrs. Tami Martin, the widow of the late Mayor of Freeland Mayor Tim Martin. Freeland is the highest elevated borough in Pennsylvania at 1,943 feet above sea level.HistoryPre-incorporationJoseph Birkbeck, the founder of Birbeckville, was born near Brough under Stainmore, in the county of Westmorland, England on May 2, 1802. He and his wife Elizabeth came to America in 1844. After acquiring land from Edward Lynch the same year of his arrival, Birkbeck built a log cabin in the region that is the small valley between Freeland and Upper Lehigh. The next settler, Nathan Howey, purchased land from Birkbeck and built a frame house just west of Birkbecks log cabin.Developing coal mines in the nearby region created a steep increase in population and a demand for building lots. This led Birkbeck to survey the region for the town of South Heberton. South Heberton has long since lost its identity and is now simply a cluster of houses midway between Freeland and Upper Lehigh. Birkbecks sawmill is at the turn of the road just east of Upper Lehigh, and what was mainly South Heberton is now known as Upper Lehigh, a small mining town once owned by the Upper Lehigh company.(Foster Township, Luzerne Co., Pa)thumb | left | 200px |Foster Township. Freehold and South Herberton merged to create modern-day Freeland.Between 1845 and 1846, Birkbeck cut the road now known as Buck Mountain Road through the woods from South Heberton through Miners Village to Buck Mountain. Eckley was then known as Shingletown, as the chief industry there was the production of shingles.The first child born at South Heberton was Elizabeth Birkbeck, the daughter of founder Joseph Birkbeck and his wife Elizabeth, in 1845. The first death at this place was that of William, the son of Joseph and Elizabeth Birkbeck, which occurred February 11, 1846. He was four years old at the time.(Freeland: First Settlers) The first store at South Heberton was kept by a man named Feist, which was just west of Birkbecks cabin. Soon afterward another small store was run by a Mr. Mining. The first tavern was founded by N. Howes, the second settler of the region. Previous to the opening of Howess tavern, Birkbeck accommodated parties who were prospecting in this region for anthracite deposits in his own home. A frame school was built in 1878, and by 1880 the population numbered 500.Freeland was incorporated as a borough in 1876.(Columbia Lippincott Gazeteer, p. 641)Post-incorporationIn 1883, the first Slovak Lutheran Church in America was organized in Freeland.(Article on Slovaks in America, see religion subsection)The population steadily grew due to the coal mining popularity and European immigration up until the mid-20th century. During the last few decades, Freelands population has been declining while the median age has been rising and is now 42 years, four years higher than Pennsylvanias median age.(Freeland, Pennsylvania (PA) Detailed Profile - relocation, real estate, travel, jobs, hospitals, schools, crime, news, sex offenders) This is mainly due to the decline of the coal industry which was the sole appeal to new immigrants in the early 20th century.Notable people* Schott, Byzantine Catholic BishopGovernment and politicsThe former mayor of Freeland was the late Tim Martin,() a Democrat.  Martin died on 2 September 2010.() He was elected in 2001, defeating Republican candidate and Former Mayor George Barna.() The borough government consists of the mayor and city council, consisting of 7 members.( )Freeland Borough recently appointed Nadine Sist as police chief.In 2008, Freeland, which usually votes strongly Republican, as a whole voted for John McCain for President, preferring the Republican candidate by 4 votes of approximately 1,200 cast.

McIntyre_Township,_Lycoming_County,_Pennsylvania
footnotes  McIntyre Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. The population was 539 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Statistical Area.HistoryMcIntyre Township was formed from territory taken from Lewis Township by the General Assembly in 1848. It is named for Archibald McIntyre who was one of the founders of the Williamsport and Elmira Railroad.() The first pioneers arrived in the McIntyre Township area in 1794 near what is now the village of Ralston. John Smithkontz cleared a parcel of land along Creek near the mouth of Pleasant Stream on 1805.(The New York Iron and Coal Company created the first business venture in what was to become McIntyre Township in when they constructed a sawmill on Lycoming Creek. The New York Iron and Coal Company also built an iron furnace near the mouth of Frozen Run in 1831. They began to make iron using ore that was mined nearby. The company also established a charcoal making operation for the fuel that was needed to keep the furnaces fired. The iron industry had little success in McIntyre. The ore was difficult to clean, it could only be separated from the dirt that was mixed in when it was frozen. And the ore that they did manage to extract produced iron that proved to be very brittle. The reason that several companies attempted to succeed in what proved to be a failing enterprise was the fact that the furnace was within easy distance of the Williamsport and Elmira Railroad which connected the industrial centers of Williamsport, Pennsylvania and Elmira, York.(The McIntyre Coal company was founded by Jervis Langdon in 1870. He set up a mining operation in the mountains in the northeastern section of McIntyre Township. Coal mining had taken place on a small scale in the earlier years of the township, but Langdon was the first to open a large scale operation. The coal company constructed a steep (45 degrees) and long (2,300 feet) plane to get the coal from the mine to the waiting railroad cars. The village of McIntyre sprang up around the coal mines. At one time it was home to 300 households, had a church, school, store, sawmill, a boot and shoe shop, and a public hall. The McIntyre Coal Company ceased operation in 1886. The mine was abandoned, and the town was abandoned shortly after the mine.(GeographyMcIntyre Township is bordered by Tioga County to the north, McNett Township to the north and east, Cascade and Lewis Townships to the south, Cogan House and Jackson Townships to the west.() the crow flies, Lycoming County is about  northwest of Philadelphia and  east-northeast of Pittsburgh.According to the States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 47.2 square miles (122.4 km).47.2 square miles (122.1 km) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.2 km) of it (0.19%) is water.DemographicsAs of the census of 2000, there were 539 people, 210 households, and 165 families residing in the township.

The Somerset County Outline. Scottdale, Pa.: Mennonite Publishing House.  pp. 75-76.)  The land was ceded by the Iroquois Six Nations officially by the of Fort Stanwix of 1768 to Penn family as proprietors of Pennsylvania province.(Cassady, pp. 80-81.)  Early European traders crossed Jenner Township as early as 1750, when Gist documented his brief time there in his travel diary.(Cassady, p. 82) Gist is said to have named Quemahoning Creek,( which drains much of Jenner Township. The Northern Trail, an established Indian trail, crossed the territory from east to west, intersecting Quemahoning Creek at Kickenapaulins Town, a rather substantial Indian settlement, the site of which now lies under the waters of the Reservoir, just outside the township.(Cassady, p. 113.) In August 1758, the Northern Trail was improved, initially for the British military use, and renamed the Forbes Trail,(Cassady, pp. 106-109) later known as the Pennsylvania Road, the Highway, and now Route 30.(Cassady, pp. 189-191.)With the building of the Forbes Road to Ligonier and, later, onward to Fort Pitt, present-day Pittsburgh, European settlement began in earnest.  Jenner Township was formed out of the western part of Quemahoning Township in 1811.(Cassady, p. 211) The township was named in honor of Dr. Jenner, discoverer of the smallpox vaccine.  Early Jenner Township settlers were primarily German and English speakers engaged in agriculture.  Pennsylvania Dutch was still spoken in rural parts of the township until the 1960s.Jenner Crossroads, the townships first substantial European settlement, grew near a grist mill and tavern stop established about 1800 along the Pennsylvania Road.(Cassady, 1932. pp. 58, 213.) Samuel Steel built a sawmill at Jenner Crossroads in 1817; John Shopwood opened a hotel in 1825, and Samuel Elder opened the first store in 1836(Cassady, pp. 50, 216.)  Other early industry in the township included a sawmill on Quemahoning Creek built about 1813 by Moses Fream and a small woolen mill, built in 1817 by William Dalley, enlarged by Owen and William Morgan later into a small settlement known as Morgantown.(Cassady, pp. 50, 59.)Jenners, Ralphton, Acosta and Gray were each built shortly after 1900 as company towns by Consolidation Coal, a Rockefeller interest, for its newly opened deep coal mines.  Immigrants from Poland, Italy, Russia, Ruthenia, Wales, and Ireland filled the coal towns.  The Somerset Coal Strike of 1922-1923 centered in these towns, and nearby Boswell, Jerome and Windber. The strike, which ultimately failed in its goal to unionize miners, drew significant nationwide attention for the hardships suffered by local miners.(For additional detail, see Blankenhorn, Heber. 1924.

Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. Bussel, Robert.  1999.  From Harvard to the Ranks of Labor: Powers Hapgood and the American Working Class. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press.) By the 1960s, the deep mines had closed.  The town of Randolph was also a very small coal mining community in Jenner Township, any trace of which is now virtually gone, having been destroyed by highway construction in 1970.mining and some deep mining of coal continues in the immediate area.  Farming, timber harvest and tourism are also mainstays of the local economy.  Jenner Township also serves as a bedroom community for the nearby Somerset and Johnstown areas.Notable Persons in Jenner Township History*Sergeant Darby, who in 2004 exposed the Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse in Iraq, lived in the community of Jenners.

Scottdale is the home of the Southmoreland Scotties.  Early in the 20th century, Scottdale was the center of the Frick coke interests. It had steel and iron pipe mills, brass and silver works, a casket factory, a large milk-pasteurizing plant, and machine shops; all of the aforementioned are presently defunct. Scottdale is notable for its economic decline from a formerly prosperous coke-town into an archetypal Belt town. Duraloy Technologies, a supplier of specialty high alloy, centrifugal and static cast components and assemblies() is the last remnant of Scottdales steel related prosperity.In 1900, 4,261 people lived in Scottdale; in 1910, the population increased to 5,456; and in 1940, 6,493 people lived in Scottdale. The population was 4,772 at the 2000 census. Scottdale is located in the Southmoreland School District.HistoryIt is difficult to identify when the first non-Indian settler arrived in what is now the Borough of Scottdale, although the area witnessed an influx of Scotch-Irish immigrants in the late 1770s. In the mid-19th century, the present-day townsite was the location of a distillery and flour mill known as Fountain Mills.()The Railroad and and Ohio Railroad each built branch lines through the community in the early 1870s. With the coming of the railroads, the communitys economy shifted from agriculture to manufacturing and mining. Two brothers who were local farmers, Peter and Jacob Loucks, realized the impact the railroads could have on the area and laid out a small townsite consisting of 24 lots, which went on sale in 1872.()Scottdale was incorporated as a borough on February 5, 1874 and at that time renamed in honor of Alexander Scott, who had been president of the Pennsylvania Railroad and served as Secretary of War during the Civil War.() Because Scottdale sits atop major coal deposits, the community flourished due to the surrounding coal mines, as well as ovens for converting coal into (fuel). The H. C. Frick Coke Company, controlled by Clay Frick, was headquartered here. Scottdales factories in the early 20th century also produced iron pipe, tin, knives, steam engines, and caskets.Scottdale has two sites on the Register of Historic Places:  Scottdale Armory (1929) at 501 North Broadway Street,()  and the Scottdale Historic District, which encompasses the oldest parts of the borough.(The oldest extant building in the borough is the Jacob Loucks House at 115 Walnut Avenue, built in 1853.( Otherwise, the boroughs oldest residences are concentrated on Loucks Avenue, where many houses date from the 1880s.

Hill_City,_South_Dakota
footnotes                 Hill City is the oldest existing city in Pennington County, Dakota, States.  The population was 948 at the 2010 census. Hill City is located  southwest of Rapid City on State Highway 16 and on Route 385 that connects Deadwood to Hot Springs. Hill City is known as the Heart of the Hills which is derived from its close proximity to both the geographical center of the Hills, and the local tourist destinations.The city has its roots in the Black Hills mining rush of the late 19th century. Tin mining was dominant in the 1880s and led to an influx of capital and people into the area. As the mining industry subsequently waned, tourism and timber became increasingly important to the area. With the establishment of Rushmore in the 1940s, State Park, and the Motorcycle Rally, the Black Hills became known as a tourist destination which Hill City benefited from. In recent years the city has diversified to become a center for the arts in the area featuring several art studios and festivals.()HistoryHuman history in the area that became Hill City, and the greater Black Hills in particular, started by at least 7000 B.C. The Arikara arrived by 1500 A. D., followed by the Cheyenne, Crow, Kiowa and Pawnee. In the 19th century the Lakota Sioux claimed the land calling it Paha Sapa. In 1874 Major General Armstrong Custer led an expedition into the Black Hills during which gold was discovered in French Creek,  south of Hill City. The discovery of gold opened the Black Hills, and the Hill City area, to mining. Hill City was first settled by miners in 1876 who referred to the area as Hillyo. This was the second American settlement in the Black Hills.() Hill City is the oldest city still in existence in Pennington County.() A post office was constructed and opened on November 26, 1877.(http://www.sdhistory.org/arc/sdtowns.htm Retrieved on May 26, 2007)  The city almost reverted into a town when miners relocated to the northern Black Hills after the discovery of gold there. However, in 1883, tin was discovered near town and the population rebounded. The Harney Peak Tin Mining, Milling, and Manufacturing Company made its headquarters on Main Street along with at one time 15 saloons. The company was backed by English financiers and bought 1100 prospecting sites around the area. As mining grew, the city became known for its wild living and was once referred to as,  a town with a church on each end and a mile of Hell in between.  The company built the Peak Hotel on Main Street to entertain its management and executives. Upon realizing the market in Tin was unsustainable, the company ceased operation in 1902.Although a small school building was established previously, a main school building was constructed on Main Street in 1921. This school building was replaced in 2001 with the current high school. On July 10, 1939 a fire started ten miles (16 km) outside of Hill City. Among those who battled the blaze was Hill City High Schools entire basketball squad, as well as several teachers and administrators. US forest service named the school boys one of the best crews who fought the fire. The school team name thus became the Hill City Rangers and was privileged as the only school district in the United States allowed to use Bear as its official mascot.(The Story of the Hill City School Mascot, Retrieved on June 8, 2007) Hill City was incorporated on March 21, 1945.( The Harney Peak Hotel remained in operation until 1934. The Building has been restored and is the current location of the Alpine Inn. This building is on the of Registered Historic Places in South Dakota.(()() The Black Hills Institute of Geological Research opened in 1973 and is involved in excavation and display of dinosaur and other fossils.()  In 1992 the institute was engaged in a legal battle over ownership of Tyrannosaurus rex fossil named Sue.This city was one of the filming locations for TNTs 1994 film Woman: Siege at Wounded Knee.RailroadFile:BHC RR in 2001.jpg|thumb|270px|A Hills Central Railroad train steams out of Hill City in 2001, bound for South DakotaThe main railroad lines that intersected Hill City are the Northern Line (also called the High line), previously the Grand Island and Wyoming Central, operated by the Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company, and the Black Hills central line a spur that extended from Hill City to Keystone. The Northern line extended from Edgemont north through Hill City and terminated in Deadwood. Hill City was reached by this line in 1893, and the central line was extended to Keystone and reached there on January 20, 1900.( gauge trolley cars were operated at 45 minute intervals during the day on the northern line. The Northern line was discontinued for passenger service in 1949, and was fully abandoned in 1983. It is now the S. Mickelson Trail after being converted to a bike trail during the 1990s. In 1957 the Hills Central Railroad, also known locally as the 1880 train, opened a tourist passenger train on the central line. In 1972 a flood destroyed the last mile of the Burlington Northern/Black Hills Central line that extended from Hill City to Keystone. This final mile was restored in 2001. The Black Hills Central Railroad restores era style locomotives and train cars, and has been featured on the television shows, Gunsmoke episode Snow Train, Hospital and the TV mini-series, Into the West produced by TNT. The railroad also made an appearance in the movie, Orphan Train.()()()Sue controversyOn August 12, 1990, Hendrickson, an American paleontologist working for the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research discovered the fossil of what would become the most complete skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus Rex ever discovered. The fossil was named Sue after the woman who discovered it. After discovery, excavation, and transport to the Institutes facilities in Hill City, controversy arose as to who the rightful owners of the fossil was. The parties in dispute were the land owner, Maurice Williams, the tribe - and thus the federal government, and the Black Hills Institute. Since Mr. Williams had put the part of his land in trust with the federal government was case to this action. On May 12, 1992  FBI agents seized Sue from the Institute over the course of three days. The fossil was shipped to Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Through the ongoing court battle it was finally decided that Maurice Williams was the owner of the fossil. The federal government later brought a 39 count 153 charge indictment against the institute and several of its members which was related to this case and other fossils. This case turned into the longest criminal trial in South Dakota state history. Finally Larson the president of the institute was convicted on two counts customs violations for which he served two years in federal prison. Sue was finally auctioned off by Sothebys auction house, and sold by Maurice Williams to the Museum in Illinois for 8.36 million dollars.()Geography and climateHill City is located in the Black Hills at  (43.933675, -103.571415) near the geographic center of the Black Hills,(Hill City School District) which is where the cities motto The Heart of the Hills originated.

As of the 2000 census, the city population was 7,141. It is the seat of Houston County. History The town was named after Crockett who reportedly had camped nearby on his way to the Alamo; the site was very near the San Antonio Road. A family from Tennessee donated the land for the town and named it after Crockett, whom they had previously known. The town was incorporated in 1837, and a post office was granted the following year. Crockett was connected to Nacogdoches by stage service. In 1839 raids by the Alabama-Coushatta and Cherokee Indians forced the towns residents to take shelter in the fortified log courthouse. Crockett was a training center for Confederate conscripts during the Civil War. The railroad came through in 1872 enabling Crockett to exploit the countys timber resources. By 1885 the town was thriving with a population of 1,200 and the following year a school was opened for black girls. It evolved into Mary Allen Junior College, which operated into the 1970s. In 1904 lignite mining started and it peaked about 1910. The stands of timber were seriously depleted by the 1920s. The population was over 3,000 in the mid 1920s and by 1936, it was nearly 4,500. The population of Crockett increased while most of East Texas declined after War II. It reached 5,000 by the 1960 census.(Crockett Texas and Crockett Texas Hotels Motels)During this time, one of the first loop roads in the nation was built around the city.  This traffic reliever was procured through the works of heavyweight politicians who called Crockett home.  Loop 304 was built before those in Houston, Dallas/Ft. Worth, and San Antonio. Blues singer Hopkins was once arrested in Crockett, Texas. In recent years, the economy of Crockett has expanded with the construction of new retail space on Loop 304. Several historic buildings in downtown have been renovated to accommodate new office and service space.  Renewed interest in reserves of natural gas in the surrounding area has led to construction of energy infrastructure and receipt of royalty revenues for land.In 1854, A.T. Monroe, a grandnephew of President Monroe came to Crockett from Virginia. He established what is now the Monroe-Crook House built with brick placed between the inner and outer walls. George W. Crook purchased the residence in 1911. The house, open for public tours, is located in front of the John H.

Helper,_Utah
footnotes                Helper is a city in Carbon County, Utah, States about 120 miles southeast of Salt Lake City and  northwest of the city of Price. It is also known as the Hub of Carbon County. The population was 2,025 at the 2000 census.The city lies along U.S. Route 6/U.S. Route 191, a shortcut between Provo and Interstate 70, on the way from Salt Lake City to Junction, Colorado.  It is the location of Western Mining and Railroad Museum, a tourist attraction that also contains household and commercial artifacts illustrating late 19th and early 20th century living conditions. Name Helper is situated at the mouth of Price Canyon, alongside the River, on the eastern side of the Plateau in Central Utah. Trains traveling westward from the Price side to the Lake City side of the plateau required additional helper engines in order to make the steep (2.4% grade) 15 mile climb up Price Canyon to the town of Soldier Summit. Helper was named after these helper engines, which the and Rio Grande Western Railroad stationed in the city. History With the arrival of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RGW) in 1881-82, Helper began to develop as a population center. By 1887 the D&RGW had erected some twenty-seven frame residences, with more built later in the year. The railroad planned to make Helper a freight terminal after the rail lines were changed from narrow to gauge. The changeover process began in 1889 and was completed in 1891. In 1892, Helper was designated the division point between the eastern and western D&RGW terminals in Grand Junction, Colorado and Utah, respectively, and a new depot, hotel, and other buildings were constructed.On April 21, 1897, Cassidy and Lay robbed the Pleasant Valley Coal Company in nearby Castle Gate; they stayed in Helper the day before.  It was said that Butch Cassidy later came back to Helper for occasional visits.(TWMag, p-40,)Helpers growth proceeded in a slow but deliberate fashion bearing little resemblance to booming metal-mining towns. The first amenities offered the few settlers and numerous railroad workers included three saloons, one grocery store, and one clothing establishment. A school was built in 1891. By 1895 the D&RGW buildings and shops at Helper were lighted by electricity, and two reservoirs for water had been constructed.Ethnic diversity was destined to become a chief characteristic of Helper. Industrial expansion, coal mining, and railroading required a great amount of unskilled labor. In 1894 the railroads passenger department established an immigration bureau to advertise Utah Territory. This move coincided with the influx of the numerous immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and from Asia.Chinese laborers were brought in at an early date to work the Carbon County mines and railroads. By the late 1890s, Italians and Austrians (primarily Slovenians, Croatians, and Serbians) began to arrive. In 1900 Helpers population was listed at 385 people. Sixteen different nationality groups were represented. Merchant and laborer comprised most of the occupations for these early immigrants.After the unsuccessful coal miners strike of 1903-04, Italians, blacklisted from the mines at nearby Castle Gate, ventured into Helper to establish businesses and farms along the Price River. The influx of strikers into Helper accelerated its growth, with the newly established farms offering needed agricultural products.The twentieth century was launched in Carbon County (which had been formed in 1894 from Emery County) in a shroud of uncertainty, largely due to the strike situation. Greek and Japanese immigrants were brought in to break the strike, and thus new ethnic groups came onto the scene. Helper, along with Price, was fast becoming the center of the Carbon County coalfields, providing service functions to the outlying camps. A 1903-04 business directory listed sixteen separate businesses in Helper; by 1912-13 the number had grown to twenty-nine, with a population of about 850. Helper townsite was regularly organized and incorporated in 1907 with a president of the town board and members of the board serving the community.By 1914-15 there were 71 businesses listed for Helper, with 84 in 1918-19, and 157 for the years 1924-25. Many of Helpers business enterprises were associated with specific ethnic groups, but this fact illustrated the business opportunities then available in the town, enabling immigrants to break the ranks of labor. Italian and Chinese-owned businesses were joined in the 1910s and 1920s by Slavic, Greek, and Japanese establishments. Specialty shops, cafes, coffeehouses, saloons, theaters, general mercantiles, and various service-oriented businesses formed Helpers commercial district. Some ventures, such as the Mutual Mercantile Company, were joint operations between different ethnic groups.Ethnic identities, the existence of both inter- and intra-group rivalries, new waves of immigration, and Helpers position as a neutral ground for labor influenced the towns social landscape. Helper became known as the area hub because it was nestled among various mining camps, and it served as a city of refuge where strikers and union organizers as well as national guardsmen could congregate during tense times. Customs and lifestyles associated with various ethnic groups continued; however, through interaction many eventually were changed and modified in the Helper environment.While the Great Depression hit the entire county, Helpers position as a railroad center provided some stability. Helpers city hall had been built in 1927, and a civic auditorium was constructed in 1936. The D&RGW developed bridge traffic, acquiring trade from other major roads that wanted transcontinental connections.Coal production increased during World War II and continued strong through the 1960s. With this, the city of Helper also prospered. Upturns and downswings plagued the industry in the 1970s, with new lows reached in the 1980s and early 1990s. Helper continues to ride the tide of these fluctuations and, as any town influenced by the mining industry, seeks to survive during bad economic times.Helper was named the top western town for 2006 by the West Magazine, in the January/February 2007 issue.( Transportation Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Helper station, operating its Zephyr daily in both directions between Chicago and Emeryville, California, across the bay from Francisco. The now defunct Grande Zephyr also stopped at Helper. It also lies along U.S. Route 6/191, which split just north of the city - U.S. 191 heads northeast to Duchesne, while U.S. 6 heads northwest to Spanish Fork. Both continue together southeast to I-70 just west of Green River.

Incorporated as a city in 1892, Eureka became the financial center for the Mining District, a wealthy gold and silver mining area in Utah and Juab counties. The district was organized in 1869 and by 1899 became one of the top mineral producing areas in Utah. Eureka housed the Big Four minesBullion Beck and Champion, Centennial Eureka, Eureka Hill, and Gemini-and later the Chief Consolidated Mining Company.File:Eureka Headframe.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Plaque explaining a mining headframeEurekas role as the central financial point for the district ensured its survival. It housed business establishments, including the second-ever JCPenney store (then called the Golden Rule Store), financial institutions, local and county governmental buildings including Eureka City Hall (1899) and a Juab County Courthouse (1892), various churches, and the meeting places for numerous labor, social, and fraternal organizations. Mining entrepreneurs such as John Q. Packard, John Beck, Knight, and Walter Fitch Sr. were important figures in Eureka and Tintic history. In 1979 Eureka was placed in the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Tintic Mining District Multiple Resource Area, recognizing the importance of remaining buildings and sites.See also* High School* Standard Reduction MillReferences(External links()(Utah)(Utah)(Utah)Utah(Utah)(Utah)(Utah)

Fairview,_Utah
footnotes                Fairview is a city in Sanpete County, Utah, States. The population was 1,160 at the 2000 census.HistoryLocated at the confluence of the Pitch River and Cottonwood Creek, Fairview is the largest town in the northeast end of the Valley. Founded in 1859, soon after the resettlement of nearby Mount Pleasant, Fairview was one of the first new towns established during the second wave of Mormon settlement in Sanpete County.Impressed with the possibilities of the area while gathering wild hay there in early 1859, Warren P. Brady and Jehu Cox wrote to Young asking for permission to create a settlement. The pragmatic church president responded, If there is water for thirty families, you have my permission. At an organizing meeting held on 1 October 1859 in Mt. Pleasant, James N. Jones was chosen to lead a band of about twenty families interested in the new colonizing opportunity. The town site was surveyed and by the end of 1860 a large log meeting house had been completed to house church, school, and social functions. Rows of poplars were planted, streets were graded, and fences were constructed as Fairview took on the appearance of the ubiquitous Mormon Village. In 1864 the town obtained a post office and forsook its original name of North Bend in favor of the more descriptive name Fairview, because it commands an excellent view of the great granary extending south even beyond Manti, thirty miles distant.During the Black Hawk War of the mid-1860s, some Fairview residents moved to Mt. Pleasant for protection after a few men were killed in deadly skirmishes. Those who remained complied with Brigham Youngs instructions to build a fort. By the end of 1866 a thick rock wall ten feet high enclosed the center of town. Within a few years, the conflict was essentially over and aggressive settlement and community development commenced. In the course of the ensuing decade, Fairviews population burgeoned to more than 1,000, making it the fourth largest in Sanpete by 1880. In 1900 and again in 1940 the town exceeded 1,700 people; however in 1980 the population was just 900, ranking Fairview sixth in size among the countys nineteen communities.Fairview shared with its neighboring villages the fact of its Mormon origin and governance, together with its significant ethnic makeup. Yet by 1880 Fairview had the smallest percentage of foreign-born, married adults (50.3 percent) of any of the major towns in a county which averaged 72.2 percent foreign-born. Fairview was distinctive in other ways as well. Initially the child of larger Mt. Pleasant, only six miles to the south, Fairview eventually became its rival, competing vigorously for land, water, timber, grazing rights, and a fair share of church and government funds. The towns Mormon bishops sometimes found themselves in the center of bitter disputes with leaders of other communities, much to the dismay of local apostle and stake president Hyde, who was assigned to arbitrate disputes and settle contentions.Yet despite their strong-willed and independent natures, the people of Fairview took full part in the cooperative society of their times. In 1874 they enthusiastically followed church counsel and established a united order. Stock certificates (7,500 shares) were sold at $10 a share to fund the venture. But like most of the other united orders in the territory, Fairviews was doomed to rapid failure. Poor crops and undercapitalization nearly forced its demise in 1874 after only a few months of existence. Despite gallant and creative efforts to keep it alive, the order was discontinued in 1876.Fairviews economic base has always depended on agriculture and the livestock industry. Following trapper Barney Wards lead, irrigation ditches were dug and reservoir sites identified soon after settlement. Food crops, hay, and grains were planted and, in 1870, the towns first flour mill was constructed south of town. Livestock raising, ranging from beef and sheep to chickens and turkeys, has persisted throughout Fairviews history. Because of its proximity to canyon forests, sawmills were established in the early decades to support a lumber industry. By the turn of the century, there were half a dozen steam sawmills in the mountains east of town.Beginning in the late 1860s, Fairview developed a one-street commercial district along the old territorial road running through the middle of town. In 1869 a Zions Cooperative Mercantile Institution was started in Fairview. Other stores and businesses followed, so that by 1900 Fairviews downtown could boast of a public library, several general stores, a furniture store, a creamery, a harness shop, a butcher shop, and two hotels. In 1881 a Presbyterian mission school was funded, with a chapel being erected in 1894. A good public school system was established in the 1890s; 497 of Fairviews 1,800 population in 1898 were students. Recreational needs were accommodated in a social hall and the Eclipse Pavilion.The arrival of the Rio Grande Western Railroad in the 1890s bolstered Fairviews ability to import equipment and export its surplus goods, immensely benefiting the towns economic strength as it also did for other Sanpete cities. Fairviews fortunes rose and fell with the cycle of the regional economy after the railroad-enhanced boom and its population high-water mark in 1900, however.The 20th century brought diversified businesses and industries, including dairies, roller mills, coal mining, and fur ranches. The Fairview State Bank was organized in 1914, reflecting the optimism of the local economy. Yet, in the 21st century, agriculture and livestock raising remain the dominant ways of making a living. Unlike other parts of the county where cattle and turkey raising are the leading cash producers, sheep continue to outpace all other economies in Fairview, accounting for 46 percent of the farm and ranch operations in northeast Sanpete County.Like most of the other towns in Sanpete County, Fairview has a rich architectural legacy. The many remaining historic structures not only inform us of the varied types of materials, crafts, and styles employed by Fairviews forebears, they also remind us of many kinds of activities that gave the town its past and present nature. The two 1920s-30s masonry LDS meetinghouses, replacing simpler, earlier edifices, speak of the continuing Mormon presence, while the two-story rock school (now a museum) and brick town hall suggest something of the towns bygone stature. The Fairview Roller Mills, one of the most picturesque industrial buildings in the county, is a monument to the agrarian foundation of Fairviews existence. Impressive business buildings remain clustered along Main Street, while houses and outbuildings of every type, style, and material dot the blocks to the east and west. Long gone are the log meetinghouse, stone fort, tall rows of poplars, and the Sanpete infirmary (or Poor House), but many other remnants of the rural landscape remain which identify key elements of Fairviews history and present character.GeographyFairview is located at  (39.628890, -111.438264).According to the States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.2 square miles (3.2 km2), all of it land.DemographicsAs of the census of 2000, there were 1,160 people, 371 households, and 294 families residing in the city.

The mineral maganese was used in the production of steel. At one time the mining operations there were among the largest in the world. The mines are located at the foothills of the mountains of the Shenandoah National Park. They are two miles east of Crimora Station on the Norfolk Southern railroad formerly known as the Shenandoah valley railroad. Crimora Station was located at mile post 136.9. The station is no longer there. The remains of the mine consist of three adjoining man-made lakes that range from 20 to 100 ft. deep, with underwater shafts connecting multiple water sources around the Crimora area.TransportationCrimora is located roughly 5 miles north of Waynesboro, Virginia on Route 340, known as Eastside Highway. It is a U.S primary and has locally been called The Bloody Highway because of the above average crash statistics for Augusta county.

Centralia,_Washington
footnotes                Centralia is a city in Lewis County, Washington, States. The population was 16,336 at the 2010 census.HistoryIn pioneer days, Centralia was the halfway stopover point for stagecoaches operating between the River and Seattle. In 1850, J. G. Cochran came from Missouri with his adopted son, a young African-American man named George Washington. Cochran filed a donation land claim on the townsite, and later in 1852, sold Washington his claim for $6,000. The new owner built a home and filed a plat for the town of Centerville, offering lots for $10 each, with one lot free to buyers who built houses.In 1891, the population, over 1,000, found its mail confused with that of another Centerville in the state, and the name of the town was changed to Centralia. (Washington - A guide to the Evergreen State, WPA American Guide Series, Washington State Historical Society, 1941). It was officially incorporated as Centralia on February 3, 1886. The city was the site of the infamous Centralia Massacre in 1919.The 1940 population of Centralia was 7,414.December 2007 floodOn average, there are 136 sunny days per year in Centralia. Due to flooding from the December 2007 Pacific Northwest storms, a twenty-mile (32 km) stretch of Interstate 5, which runs through Lewis County near Centralia, was closed between exits 68 and 88 for several days.() The economic cost of the I-5 closure was roughly $4 million a day.   To redirect water away from the freeway, WSDOT breached a dike to allow the water to drain back into the Chehalis River.According to Washington Transportation Secretary Paula Hammond, the damage done to Interstate 5 was not as bad as previously believed.  Transportation workers were able to start repairs while the waters receded from the roadway.At the height of the storm, at least 75,000 customers in Washington lost electric service.  Near downtown Centralia, twenty square blocks had been flooded.  The December 2007 Pacific Northwest storms and flood were blamed for at least eight deaths and billions of dollars of damage to the area.Economy and employmentOn Nov. 28, 2006 it was announced that TransAlta Corp., the largest employer in Centralia and operator of the Coal Mine, would eliminate 600 high-paying coal mining jobs.  The nearby coal-fired Power Plant is not affected, except the coal to fire the plant will now come from Wyoming and Montana.( Daily Olympian article)Recent reports indicate, however, that there has been no noticeable economic effect upon the City of Centralia as a result (except the addition of homes to the real estate inventory, but are being absorbed), though it was greatly speculated upon.  Data indicates that Centralia is experiencing growth in all three sectors with new job growth on a regular basis; both in its light industrial areas as well as its core business district, Historic Downtown Centralia.(Boone, Rolf. Unemployment claims dropped more than 300 from peak, report says. The Olympian.

The college has been in operation since September 14, 1925. The colleges first classes were held in the top floor of the Centralia High School building and classes were taught by part-time teachers who also taught high school students. The college found its beginning in large part due to the efforts of C. L. Littel, Centralia Public Schools Superintendent and Dean Frederick E. Bolton of the of Washington School of Education. During the early years Centralia College prepared students who would later go on to enroll at the University of Washington and a special partnership between the colleges remained in place until 1947. The following year Centralia College earned its accreditation from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. Two years later the colleges first major campus building, Kemp Hall, was constructed in the heart of Centralia. The effort to expand and develop a separate campus was largely influenced by the end of WWII and newly enacted GI Bill. This created an oversupply of new students ready to train for their career with limited space to do so. Just prior to this enrollment had been shrinking, as many young Centralians and other residents of Lewis County had left to join the war effort. Prior to the war the colleges future was previously in jeopardy during the Great Depression and resulting local bank closures. From approximately 1925 through the 1940s the college was primarily funded through private loans and donations from local businesses and community members but steady funds were not always readily available. Credit for Centralia College surviving during these difficult times is in part given to Margaret Corbet, administrator, faculty member, and namesake of Corbet Hall, due to her efforts to keep the college financially afloat.(http://www.centralia.edu/admin/)(http://www.centralia.k12.wa.us/22841064104033117/site/default.asp)(http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPageoutput.cfm&file_id8507)(http://www.centralia.edu/international/pdf/CompleteHandbook.doc)Points of interestCarnegie Library(http://www.trlib.org/Locations/Pages/LibraryInformation.aspx?libce) is located in Washington Park and was originally built in 1913 followed by a remodel in 1977-78.

Sedro-Woolley,_Washington
footnotes                Sedro-Woolley is a city in County, Washington, United States. The population was 10,540 at the 2010 census. It is included in the Mount Vernon&ndash;Anacortes, Washington Statistical Area.HistoryOfficially incorporated on December 19, 1898, Sedro-Woolley was formed from neighboring rival towns known as Sedro and Woolley in County, northwestern Washington,  inland from the Sound,  south of the border with Canada and  north of Seattle.(stumpranchonline.com/skagitjournal)Four British bachelors, led by David Batey, homesteaded the area in 1878, the time logjam obstructions were cleared downriver at the site of Mount Vernon.(stumpranchonline.com/skagitjournal) In 188485, Batey built a store and home for the arrival of the Mortimer Cook family from Barbara, California where Cook had been mayor for two terms. Cook intended to name his new Pacific Northwest town Bug due to the number of mosquitos present, but his wife protested along with a handful of local wives. Cook was already the namesake for the town Cooks Ferry on the Thompson River in Columbia. With Bug being so unpopular, Cook derived a town name from Spanish; knowing cedra was the word for cedar, he replaced two letters to make the name unique, settling on Sedro.(stumpranchonline.com/skagitjournal)Sedro, on the northern banks of the River, proved susceptible to floods. In 1899, Pacific Railway developer Nelson Bennett began laying track from the town of Fairhaven,  northwest on Bay, and real estate developer Norman R. Kelley platted a new town of Sedro on high ground a mile northwest of Cooks site. The and Southern Railroad arrived in Sedro on Christmas Eve 1899, in time for Bennett to receive a performance bonus from the towns at both ends, and a month after Washington became the 42nd state in the Union.(stumpranchonline.com/skagitjournal)Within months, two more railroads crossed the F&S road bed a half mile north of new Sedro, forming a triangle where 11 trains eventually arrived daily. Railroad developer Philip A. Woolley moved his family from Illinois, to Sedro in December 1899 and bought land around the triangle. He built the Skagit River Lumber & Shingle Mill next to where the railroads crossed and he started his namesake company town there that was based on sales of railroad ties to the three rail companies, including the and Northern Railway (forerunner of the Great Northern Railway) and the Pacific Railroad.Meanwhile a fourth town rose nearby when the F&S laid rails on a wye that led northeast from Sedro about four and a half miles to coal mines. Bennett bought the mines, along with Montana mining financier Charles X. Larrabee, and they soon sold their interests to J. Hill, owner of the Great Northern. The resulting ore soon turned out to be more suitable for coking coal and a town began there named Cokedale. Cokedale faded in importance when the mine declined and the other towns all merged on December 19, 1898, as Sedro-Woolley.(There are extensive articles about these occurrences and local and Skagit River history at the online River Journal of History & Folklore (http://www.skagitriverjournal.com/).)On May 15, 1922, a large circus elephant known as Tusko escaped from the G. Barnes Circus, which was making one of its stops in Sedro-Woolley, at that time. The elephant stomped his way through the little logging town and right into local history, demolishing fences, knocking over laundry lines and trees, telephone poles, and a T along the way.After logging and coal-mining declined, the major employers and industries became the nearby State Hospital (a mental-health facility) (stumpranchonline.com/skagitjournal) and Skagit Steel & Iron Works, which rose from the back room of a local hardware store in 2002 to became a major supplier of implements and parts for logging and railroad customers and which manufactured machines and parts for the war effort in World War II and artillery shells, starting in 1953. By 1990, that company was gone and the hospital was closed but new industry is developing north of town, including robotics. Government The City of Sedro-Woolley operates under a Mayor-Council form of government.  The elected mayor oversees the operations of the departments of Finance, Police, Fire, Municipal Court, Public Works, Community Development, and Parks & Recreation.  Sedro-Woolley Parks & Recreation maintains a large number of public parks and open spaces such as Hammer Heritage Square in downtown Sedro-Woolley.  Riverfront Park situated on the Bank of the Skagit River is the signature park.  It consists of nearly  and includes picnic shelters, baseball fields, RV park, amphitheater, and an off-leash dog park.  Every year on the 4th of July the city celebrates with a festive carnival, and hosts the logger rodeo parade.

Located in a valley along the River within a mountainous region of southern West Virginia, the town was nearly destroyed by flash flooding in July 2001. While the town has attempted to redevelop with the aid of state and federal recovery money, many local businesses and residents have left the area permanently. Organizations like the Mullens-based Appalachian Improvement League are working to improve conditions across the region. Mullens is also the hometown of York Knicks coach DAntoni. History Mullens was incorporated as a town on September 17, 1912 and operated under a charter issued by the Court of Wyoming County. It was named for A. J. Mullins, who owned the land upon which the town is built. The towns original name was spelled with an i but when A.J didnt dot his i on a paper it looked as though he signed an e. An Act of the Virginia Legislature granting a charter to the City of Mullens was passed February 22, 1929.The early growth of the Mullens community came with development of the lumber and coal mining industries. In the early 20th century, coal-mining manager and developer Nelson Page of Ansted helped open the Gulf Coalfield with plans for the Railway, a new railroad. When Page ran into competitive collusion by the bigger railroads which would have wrecked his project, backed by his silent partner, wealthy industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers, the plan was expanded in a secretive and massive way to build a line all the way east to the port of Roads. Completed in 1909, the Railway (VGN) established engine terminal and yard facilities near Mullens which employed hundreds of workers during the first half of the 20th century. The VGN was merged with the and Western Railway (N&W) in 1959, and both later became part of the Southern Railway (NS).

The 2,110 megawatt facility owned by PacifiCorp is one of the largest coal-fired electric power generation facilities in the western United States.()Almond Stage StationAlso located in Point of Rocks are the remnants of the original Almond Stage Station, built in 1862 at the behest of Holladay.  Holladay wished to move his stage coach line further south because of repeated attacks by Indians.  The station was constructed of local sandstone with a sod covered roof, which allowed it to survive at least one attack and attempted burning.  In 1868, the station was converted to a stop along the transcontinental railroad and the Trail as well as a stop for the Pony Express.  When mining declined in the area the station was sold and used as a private home before being absorbed by the Wyoming State Parks and restored.()   References(of Rocksof Rocksof Rocksof Rocksof Rocks()of Rocks

History_of_Pittsburgh
thumb|right|370px|Pittsburgh in 1902The history of Pittsburgh began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern Pittsburgh region. Eventually French and British explorers encountered the strategic juncture where the Allegheny and Rivers meet to form the Ohio. The area became a battleground when France and Britain fought for control in the 1750s.Following American independence in 1783, the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow.  The region saw the short-lived Rebellion, when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.  By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to one of the largest cities west of the Mountains. Production of steel began in 1875.  By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nations steel.  Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring uneployment of the Great Depression, the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it was the center of the of Democracy, producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned.Following World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the Renaissance. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry, with massive layoffs and mill closures. Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s and in 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million, and is 90% white. Despite the flourishing service, education, medicine, arts and high tech sectors, Pittsburgh still faces many problems, including poverty, crime and pollution.Native American era thumb|right|350px|Native Americans lived near the forks of the Ohio for thousands of years. These are some important villages, most circa 1750s, and earlier sites.For thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Rockshelter, an site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.(Shreeve, James. The Greatest Journey, National Geographic, March 2006, pg. 64.) During the culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5 km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the culture.()By 1700 the Iroquois held dominion over the upper Ohio valley; other tribes included the Lenape, or Delawares, who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and the Shawnees, who had migrated up from the south.(Sipe, C. Hale, The Indian Wars of Pennsylvania, 1831, Wennawoods Publishing reprint 1999) With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by European diseases, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and malaria.(Cook, Noble David. Born to Die: Disease and New World Conquest, 14921650, (1998))In 1748, when Weiser visited Logstown,  downriver from Pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: 165 Lenape, 163 Seneca, 162 Shawnee, 100 Wyandot, 74 Mohawk, 40 Tisagechroamis, 35 Onondaga, 20 Cayuga, 15 Oneida, and 15 Mohicans.(Agnew, Daniel, Myers, Shinkle & Co., Logstown, on the Ohio, 1894. pg. 7.)Shannopins Town, a Seneca tribe village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was the home village of Aliquippa, but was deserted after 1749. Sawcunk, on the mouth of the Beaver River, was a Lenape (Delaware) settlement and the principal residence of Shingas, a chief of the Lenapes.(Buck, The Planting of Civilization in Western Pennsylvania, (1939), pg. 30.) Chartiers Town was a Shawnee town and Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny with an estimated 300400 residents.(Course of study in geographic, biographic and historic Pittsburgh, The Board of Public Education, Pittsburgh, 1921.)Early colonization (17471763)thumb|right|270px|British and French Forts, 17531758, and the routes of the two British campaigns to take the forks of the Ohioright|280pxThe first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area.() Europeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the first Company, an English land speculation company, won a grant of 200,000 acres (800 km) in the upper Ohio Valley. From a post at present-day Maryland, the company began to construct an  wagon road to the River() employing a Delaware Indian Chief named Nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by Capt. Cresap to begin widening the track into a road following mostly the same route as an ancient Amerindian trail(year1916) which is now known as Trail. The river crossing and flats at creek, the earliest point and shortest distance the choices a wagon road descent could follow (later in the war, fortified as Burd, now Brownsville) was one of several possible destinations. Another alternative was the divergent route that became Road a few years later through present day New Stanton. In the event, the Amerindian path was not widened to a wagon road much beyond the Narrows pass before hostilities arose, resulting in a series of expeditions, each of which made improvements to the track.The French had built nearby Logstown for the Native Americans as a trade and council center to increase their influence in the Ohio Valley.( Between June 15 and November 10, 1749, an expedition headed by de Bienville, a French officer, traveled down the Allegheny and Ohio to bolster the French claim to the region.( De Bienville warned away English traders and posted markers claiming the territory.(Crumrine, Boyd, L.H. Everts and Co. History of Washington County, Pennsylvania, 1882, pg. 26.)In 1753, Duquesne, the of New France, sent another, larger expedition. At present-day Pennsylvania, an advance party built Presque Isle. They also cut a road through the woods and built Le Boeuf on French Creek, from which it was possible at high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny, where, the following year, they built Machault.()Alarmed at these French incursions in the Ohio Valley, Dinwiddie of Virginia sent Major Washington to warn the French to withdraw.( Accompanied by Gist, Washington arrived at the Forks of the Ohio on November 25, 1753.File:Gwash map01.jpg|thumb|left|290px|Washingtons sketch of Monongahela River, Allegheny River (named as the upper Ohio), and French Creek that accompanied his journal (1753) in which he recorded his impressions(): As I got down before the Canoe, I spent some Time in viewing the Rivers, & the Land in the Fork, which I think extremely well situated for a Fort; as it has the absolute Command of both Rivers. The Land at the Point is 20 or  above the common Surface of the Water; & a considerable Bottom of flat well timberd Land all around it, very convenient for Building.Proceeding up the Allegheny, Washington presented Dinwiddies letter to the French commanders first at Venango, and then Le Boeuf. The French officers received Washington with wine and courtesy, but did not withdraw.(Governor Dinwiddie then sent Captain Trent to build a fort at the Forks of the Ohio. On February 17, 1754, Trent began construction of the fort, the first European habitation() at the site of present-day Pittsburgh. The fort, named Prince George, was only half-built by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia. The French then tore down the British fortification and built Duquesne.((Governor Dinwiddie then launched another expedition. Colonel Joshua Fry commanded the regiment which his second-in-command, George Washington, leading an advance column. On May 28, 1754, Washingtons unit clashed with the French in the of Jumonville Glen during which 13 French soldiers were killed and 21 were taken prisoner.() After the battle, Washingtons ally, Seneca chief Tanaghrisson, unexpectedly executed the French commanding officer, Ensign Coulon de Jumonville. The French pursued Washington and on July 3, 1754, George Washington surrendered following the of Fort Necessity. These actions sparked the and Indian War (17541763), or, the Years War, an imperial confrontation between England and France fought in both hemispheres.(()Image:Bouquet blockhouse.JPG|thumb|270px|The Pitt Blockhouse, dating to 1764, is the oldest structure in Pittsburgh.()In 1755, George Washington accompanied British General Braddocks expedition. Two regiments marched from Fort Cumberland across the Mountains and into western Pennsylvania. Following a path Washington surveyed, over 3,000 men built a wagon road  wide, that when complete, was the first road to cross the Mountains. Braddocks Road, as it was known, blazed the way for the future Road. The expedition crossed the River on July 9, 1755. French troops from Fort Duquesne ambushed Braddocks expedition at Field, nine miles (14 km) from Fort Duquesne.(The Unwritten History of Braddocks Field (Pennsylvania), editor Geo. H. Lamb, A. M., Nicholson Printing Co., 1917) In the Battle of the Monongahela, the French inflicted heavy losses on the British, and Braddock was mortally wounded.( The surviving British and colonial forces retreated. This left the French and their Native American allies with dominion over the upper Ohio valley.(On September 8, 1756, an expedition of 300 militiamen destroyed the Shawnee and Lenape village of Kittanning, and in the summer of 1758, British General John Forbes began a campaign to capture Fort Duquesne.( At the head of 7,000 regular and colonial troops, Forbes built Ligonier and Bedford, from where he cut a wagon road over the Allegheny Mountains, later known as Forbes Road. On the night of September 1314, 1758, an advance column under Major James Grant was massacred in the of Fort Duquesne.( The battleground, the high hill east of the Point, was named Grants Hill in the memory of Major Grant. With this defeat, Forbes decided to wait until spring. But when he heard that the French had lost Frontenac and largely evacuated Duquesne, he planned an immediate attack. Now hopelessly outnumbered, the French abandoned and razed Fort Duquesne. Forbes occupied the burned fort on November 25, 1758 and ordered the construction of Fort Pitt, named after British Secretary of State Pitt the Elder. He also named the settlement between the rivers, Pittsborough (see of Pittsburgh).(( The British garrison at Fort Pitt made substantial improvements to its fortification.( The French never attacked Fort Pitt and the war soon ended with the Treaty of Paris.( Gateway to the West (17631799) In 1760, the first considerable settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow. Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the lower town, near the forts ramparts, and the upper town, along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street. In April 1761, a census ordered by Colonel Bouquet counted 332 people and 104 houses.()In a final attempt to drive out the British, Rebellion began with an assault on British forts in May 1763. Ohio Valley and Great Lakes tribes overran many forts; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt. Receiving warning of the coming attack, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts.( Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef. Pontiacs forces attacked the fort on June 22, 1763. The of Fort Pitt lasted for two months.( Pontiacs warriors kept up a continuous, though ineffective, fire on it from July 27 through August 1, 1763.( Then they drew off to meet the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet, which defeated them in the of Bushy Run.( This victory sealed British dominion over the forks of the Ohio, if not the entire Ohio valley. In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added a redoubt, the Pitt Blockhouse, which still stands, the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the Mountains.(thumb|left|300px|Fort Pitt, 1795The Iroquois signed the Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands south of the Ohio to the British.( European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English, a third were Scottish-Irish, and the rest were Welsh, German and others.() These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything had to be manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles.( Settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.(Increasing violence with especially the Shawnee, Miami, and Wyandot tribes lead to War in 1774, and conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the Revolution. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General Hand took command. In 1779, Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny.(With the war still ongoing, in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian. In 1783, the Revolutionary War ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. In the 1784 of Fort Stanwix, the Iroquois ceded the land north of the Line to Pennsylvania.(thumb|right|300px|Map of Pittsburgh in 1795After the Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was building. Flatboats could carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver, while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver.()The village began to develop vital institutions. Henry Brackenridge, a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator, introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28, 1787. The Academy later became the University of Western Pennsylvania (1819) and is today known as the of Pittsburgh (1908).() Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.(The town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment.() During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the towns first courthouse, a wooden structure on Market Square, was built.( In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.( Iron City (18001859) thumb|right|300px|Second Court House, completed 1841()Commerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh sat in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.(The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburghs growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The of 1812 was catalytic in the growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.( Also, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.( When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of dust.()Other emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh. In 1818, the first segment of the National Road was completed, from Baltimore to Wheeling, bypassing Pittsburgh. This threatened to render the town less essential in east-west commerce. In the coming decade, however, many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure. In 1818, the regions first river bridge, the Smithfield Street Bridge, opened, the first step in building the city of bridges.() In 1820, the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed, connecting Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. In 1834, the Main Line Canal was completed. Now Pittsburgh was part of a transportation system that included rivers, roads, and canals.()Manufacture continued to grow. In 1835, McClurg, Wade and Co. built the first locomotive west of the Alleghenies. Already, Pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was not a town, but one of the largest cities west of the mountains. In 1841, the Second Court House, on Grants Hill, was completed. Made from polished gray sandstone, the court house had a rotunda  in diameter and  high.()Like many burgeoning cities of its day, Pittsburghs growth outstripped some of its necessary infrastructure, such as a water supply with dependable pressure.() Because of this, on April 10, 1845, a great fire burned out of control, destroying over a thousand buildings and causing $9M in damages.( As the city rebuilt, the age of rails arrived. In 1851, the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Cleveland and Allegheny City (present-day North Side).( In 1854, the Railroad began service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:(* 939 factories in Pittsburgh and Allegheny City** employing more than 10K workers** producing almost $12M in goods** using 400 steam engines* Total coal consumed &mdash; 22M bushels* Total iron consumed &mdash; 127K tons* In steam tonnage, third busiest port in the nation, surpassed only by York City and Orleans.thumb|right|370px|Monongahela River Scene, 1857.( Steel City (18591946)The iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s.Scotch Irish leadershipIngham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was largely Scotch Irish. Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and developed their own sense of uniqueness.(John Ingham, The Iron Barons (1978) quotes pp 7 and 228.)Indeed new immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch Irish stronghold. For example, Mellon (b. Ulster 18131908) left Ireland in 1823 and became the founder of the famous Mellon clan, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists like H. Laughlin (b. Ulster 18061882) of and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.(Gregory Barnhisel James Laughlin, New Directions, and the Remaking of Ezra Pound (2005) p. 48.)TechnologyIn 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The Civil War boosted the citys economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Arsenal and the Pitt Foundry.( Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the worlds first 21 gun.() By wars end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new process.()Industrialists such as Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, W. Mellon, and M. Schwab built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. Westinghouse, credited with such advancements as the air brake and founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Switch & Signal (1881), and Electric Company (1886).()  Banks played a key role in Pittsburghs development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. For example, T. Mellon & Sons Bank, founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.(Ingham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.(John N. Ingham, Iron and Steel in the Pittsburgh Region: The Domain of Small Business, Business and Economic History 1991 20: 107-116)Geography of industrializationBeginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central citys labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The regions rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.(Edward K. Muller, Industrial Suburbs and the Growth of Metropolitan Pittsburgh, 1870-1920, Journal of Historical Geography 2001 27(1): 58-73)Representative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of Vandergrift, according to Mosher (1995).  Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Law Olmsteds landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A  strike and lockout at McMurtrys steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capitals treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtrys skilled workers and led to McMurtrys greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrifts worker-residents to break the first major strike against the States Steel Corporation.(Anne E. Mosher, Something Better than the Best: Industrial Restructuring, George McMurtry and the Creation of the Model Industrial Town of Vandergrift, Pennsylvania, 1883-1901, Annals of the Association of American Geographers 1995 85(1): 84-107,)GermansDuring the mid-19th century, Pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx of German immigrants, including a brick mason whose son, J. Heinz, founded the Heinz Company in 1872. Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity, working conditions, hours, and wages,() but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent union.()Labor unionsAs a manufacturing center, Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife. During the railroad strike of 1877, Pittsburgh erupted into widespread rioting.(Harpers Weekly, Journal of Civilization Vol. XXL, No. 1076 New York, August 11, 1877.) Dozens died and over 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of the Railroad. thumb|left|370px|Burning of Pennsylvania Railroad and Union Depot, Pittsburgh, July 2122, 1877In 1892, another confrontation in steel resulted in 10 deaths when Steel Companys manager Clay Frick sent in Pinkertons to break the Strike, and the strikers shot up the Pinkertons.  Labor strife continued into the years of the Depression, with further organization of Heinz workers, with the assistance of the Radical Alliance.CarnegieCarnegie, an immigrant from Scotland, a former Railroad executive turned steel magnate, founded the Steel Company. He proceeded to play a key role in the development of the U.S. steel industry. In 1890, he established the first Library, and in 1895, the Carnegie Institute. In 1901, as the Steel Corporation formed, he sold his mills to Morgan for $250 million, making him one of the worlds richest men. Carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich, dies disgraced.(Carnegie, Andrew, The Gospel of Wealth, North American Review, June 1889. Retrieved on 2008-11-06) He devoted the rest of his life to public service, establishing libraries, trusts, and foundations. In Pittsburgh, he founded the Institute of Technology (now Mellon University) and the Museums of Pittsburgh.(The third (and present) County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886. In 1890, trolleys began operations.( In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Shore.(thumb|right|300px|Steelworker watching molten steel being poured into a mold, J&L Steel, Pittsburgh, May 1942.Early 20th centuryBy 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:(* Nexus of a vast railway system, with freight yards capable of handling 60K cars*  of harbor* Yearly river traffic in excess of 9M tons* Value of factory products more than $211M (with Allegheny City)* Allegheny county produced, as percentage of national output, about:** 24% of the iron** 34% of the Bessemer steel** 44% of the open hearth steel** 53% of the crucible steel** 24% of the steel rails** 59% of the structural shapesEnvironmentDuring the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburghs dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburghs smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Era and was cleared up in the 1930s-1940s. With little regard for beauty, steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.(Joel Tarr, The Metabolism of the Industrial City: The Case of Pittsburgh, Journal of Urban History 2002 28(5): 511-545) In November 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank.()To escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown. Fifth Avenue was dubbed Millionaires Row because of the many mansions lining the street. On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh witnessed the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put over 60,000 steelworkers out of work.(Mildred Flaherty, The Great Saint Patricks Day Flood, (The Local History Company, Pittsburgh, PA, 2004))High cultureOakland became the citys predominant cultural and educational center, including three universities, multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. Oaklands of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the worlds second-tallest educational building, the 42-story of Learning.() It towered over Field, where the Pirates played from 19091970.(New immigrantsBetween 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold. Many of the new residents were immigrants who sought employment in the factories and mills and introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city. Ethnic neighborhoods emerged on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side, Hill, Bloomfield, and Hill, home to 28% of the citys almost 21,000 Jewish households.() The Strip District, the citys produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.(thumb|right|700px|Downtown Pittsburgh panorama, from 1920.The years 19161930 marked the largest migration of African-Americans to Pittsburgh. Known as the cultural nucleus of Black Pittsburgh, Wylie Avenue in the District was an important jazz mecca. Jazz greats such as Ellington and Pittsburgh natives Strayhorn and Hines played there. Two of the Negro Leagues greatest rivals, the Crawfords and the Grays, often competed in the Hill District. The teams dominated the Negro National League in the 1930s and 1940s.(1930sPittsburgh was a Republican stronghold starting in the 1880s,(Between 1884 and 1933, only two Democrats served as mayors of Pittsburgh, Bernard McKenna from 1893 through 1896 and George Guthrie between 1906 and 1909.) and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes. But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the Deal Coalition. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.(Stefano Luconi, The Roosevelt Majority: The Case of Italian Americans in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, Journal of American Ethnic History 1996 15(2): 32-59)(Richard C. Keller, Pennsylvanias Little New Deal (1960))Guffey, statewide leader of the Democrats, and his local lieutenant Lawrence gained control of all federal patronage in Pittsburgh after Roosevelts landslide in 1932 and the election of a Democratic mayor in 1933. Guffey and Lawrence used the Deal programs to increase their political power and build up a Democratic machine that superseded the decaying Republican machine. Guffey himself acknowledged that a high rate of people on relief was not only a challenge but also an opportunity. He regarded each relief job as Democratic patronage.(Bruce M. Stave, The New Deal and the Last Hurrah: Pittsburgh Machine Politics (1970))1940sPittsburgh was at the center of the of Democracy that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. and the Allies during World War II. Pittsburghs mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort.(PostwarLawrence, a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvanias governor from 1959 to 1963.(Michael P. Weber, Dont Call Me Boss: David L. Lawrence, Pittsburghs  Renaissance Mayor, (1988)) Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburghs  political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly.(Richard Robbins, David L. Lawrence: The Deft Hand Behind Pittsburghs - and Pennsylvanias - Politics, Pennsylvania Heritage 2001 27(4): 22-29)  In 1946  Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the citys future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the citys working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.(Stefano Luconi, The Enforcement of the 1941 Smoke-Control Ordinance and Italian Americans in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania History 1999 66(4): 580-594)  Renaissance I (19461973)Image:ThreeRiversStadium.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The multi-purpose Rivers Stadium was built in 1970 as part of the Renaissance I project. It was imploded in 2001.Rich and productive, Pittsburgh was also the Smoky City, with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day( as well as rivers that resembled open sewers.  Civic leaders, notably Mayor L. Lawrence, elected in 1945, and K. Mellon, chairman of Bank, began smoke control and urban revitalization, also known as Renewal projects that transformed the city( in unforeseen ways.Renaissance I began in 1946.  Title One of the Act of 1949 provided the means in which to begin.  By 1950, vast swaths of buildings and land near the Point were demolished for Gateway Center. 1953 saw the opening of the (since demolished) Greater Pittsburgh Municipal Airport.( In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the lower District, an area inhabited predominantly by people of African descent, was completely destroyed.  Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using domain, forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and over 1,200 residents, to make room for a cultural center that included the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961.()  Other than one apartment building, none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built.In the early 1960s, the neighborhood of East Liberty was also included in Renaissance I Urban Renewal plans, with over  of the neighborhood being demolished and replaced with garden apartments, three 20-story public housing apartments, and a convoluted road-way system that circled a pedestrianized shopping district.  In the span of just a few years during the mid-1960s, East Liberty became a blighted neighborhood. There were some 575 businesses in East Liberty in 1959, but only 292 in 1970, and just 98 in 1979. The businesses that remained tended not to serve the majority of nearby Pittsburghers, but only the captive audience that remained in what was now an urban ghetto.Preservation efforts by the History and Landmarks Foundation, along with community neighborhood groups, resisted the demolition plans.  The neighborhoods containing rich architectural heritage, including the War Streets, Allegheny West, and Manchester, were spared.  The center of Allegheny City with its culturally and socially important buildings were not as lucky.  All of the buildings, with the exception of the Old U.S. Post Office, the Carnegie Library, and Buhl Planetarium were destroyed and replaced with the pedestrianized Allegheny Center mall and apartments.Despite this faux pas, the citys industrial base continued to grow. and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside. Heinz, Plate Glass, Alcoa, Westinghouse, Steel and its new division, the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s.( 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I: the Steel Tower and Rivers Stadium.( In 1974, with the addition of the fountain at the tip of the Golden Triangle, State Park was completed.() Although air quality was dramatically improved, and Pittsburghs manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, however, was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations. Reinvention (1973present)300px|thumb|right|Downtown Pittsburgh from Mt. WashingtonDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. steel industry came under increasing pressure from foreign competition. Manufacture in Germany and Japan was booming. Foreign mills and factories, built with the latest technology, benefited from lower labor costs and powerful government-corporate partnerships, allowing them to capture increasing market shares of steel and steel products. Separately, demand for steel softened due to recessions, the oil crisis, and increasing use of other materials.(() At this critical juncture, market, anti-union policies, and deregulation, especially under President Reagan, came into play.Collapse of steelFree market pressures exposed the U.S. steel industrys own internal problems, which included a now-outdated manufacturing base that had been over-expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, hostile management and labor relationships, the inflexibility of Steelworkers regarding wage cuts and work-rule reforms, oligarchic management styles, and poor strategic planning by both unions and management. In particular, Pittsburgh faced its own challenges. Local coke and iron ore deposits were depleted, raising material costs. The large mills in the Pittsburgh region also faced competition from newer, more profitable mini-mills and non-union mills with lower labor costs.(In 1984 the Homestead Works was demolished, replaced in 1999 by The Waterfront shopping mall. As a direct result of the loss of mill employment, the number of people living in Homestead dwindled. By the time of the 2000 census, the borough population was 3,569. The borough began financially recovering in 2002, with the enlarging retail tax base.Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the steel industry in Pittsburgh began to implode. Following the 19811982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers.( The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw flight to the suburbs.()CorporationsTop corporate headquarters such as Oil (1985), Koppers (1987), Westinghouse (1991) and International (1989) were bought out by larger firms, with the loss of headquarters personnel.  At the time of the Gulf Oil merger in 1985 it was the largest single deal in world history involving the company that was #7 on the Fortune 500 just six years earlier.  Over 1,000 high paying white collar corporate and PhD lab jobs were lost during one day. Today, there are no steel mills within the city limits of Pittsburgh, although manufacture continues at regional mills, such as the Thomson Works in nearby Braddock. The Pittsburgh Urban Area remains the 22nd largest in the U.S., between those of Cleveland, Ohio and Portland, Oregon.Higher educationUniversity and the of Pittsburgh had evolved in the mid-20th century along lines that followed the needs of the heavy industries that financed and directed their development. The collapse of steel put pressure on those two universities to reinvent themselves as research centers in science and technology which acted to pull the regional economy toward high-technology fields.(Annette L. Giovengo, The Historical Roles of Pittsburghs Research Universities in Regional Economic Development, Western Pennsylvania Historical Magazine 1987 70(3): 257-277)Beginning in the 1980s, Pittsburghs economy shifted from heavy industry to services, medicine, higher education, tourism, banking, corporate headquarters, and high technology. Today, the top two private employers in the city are the of Pittsburgh Medical Center (26,000 employees) and the West Penn Allegheny Health System (13,000 employees).()(www.wpahs.org)Civic improvementsDespite the economic turmoil, civic improvements continued.  In the mid-1970s, Arthur P. Ziegler, Jr. and the History and Landmarks Foundation (Landmarks) wanted to demonstrate that historic preservation could be used to drive economic development without the use of eminent domain or public subsidies.  Landmarks acquired the former terminal buildings and yards of the and Lake Erie Railroad, a  long property at the base of Mt. Washington facing the City of Pittsburgh.  In 1976, Landmarks developed the site as a mixed-use historic reuse development that gave the foundation the opportunity to put its urban planning principles into practice.  Aided by an initial generous gift from the Foundation in 1976, Landmarks adapted five historic Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad buildings for new uses and added a hotel, a dock for the Gateway Clipper fleet, and parking areas. Now shops, offices, restaurants, and entertainment anchor the historic riverfront site on the south shore of the River, opposite the Triangle (Pittsburgh). Station Square is Pittsburghs premiere attraction generating over 3,500,000 visitors a year. It reflects a $100 million investment from all sources, with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s. In 1994, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation sold Station Square in to City Enterprises which created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs. Each year the staff and docents of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation introduce more than 10,000 people &mdash; teachers, students, adults, and visitors &mdash; to the architectural heritage of the Pittsburgh region and to the value of historic preservation.()In 1985, the & L Steel site on the north side of the Monongahela river was cleared and a publicly subsidized High Technology Center was built. The Pittsburgh Technology Center, home to many major technology companies, is planning major expansion in the area soon.( In the 1980s, the Renaissance II urban revitalization created numerous new structures, such as Place. In the 1990s, the former sites of the Homestead, Duquesne and South Side J&L mills were cleared.( In 1992, the new terminal at International Airport opened.( In 2001, the aging Three Rivers Stadium was replaced by Field and Park, despite being rejected by voter referendum.()Pittsburgh todayPresent-day Pittsburgh, with a diversified economy, a low cost of living, and a rich infrastructure for education and culture, has been ranked as one of the Most Livable Cities.() See also * Pittsburgh* of mayors of Pittsburgh* of Pittsburgh neighborhoods* of major corporations in Pittsburgh* of Pittsburgh* Riot* Flood of 1936BibliographySecondary sources* Baldwin, Leland D.

Province_of_vila
diputacionavila.esvila () is a province of central-western Spain, in the southern part of the autonomous community of and Len. It is bordered on the south by the provinces of Toledo and Cceres, on the west by Salamanca, on the north by Valladolid, and on the east by Segovia and Madrid. vila has a population of 165,138 (2002). Its capital is vila.Geographyvila is naturally divided into two sections, differing completely in soil and climate. The northern portion is generally level; the soil is of indifferent quality, strong and marly in a few places, but rocky in all the valleys of the Sierra de vila; and the climate alternates from severe cold in winter to extreme heat in summer. The populationof this part is mainly agricultural. The southern division is one mass of rugged granitic sierras, interspersed, however, with sheltered and well-watered valleys, abounding with rich vegetation.The winter here, especially in the elevated region of the Paramera and the waste lands of vila, is long and severe, but the climate is not unhealthy.The principal mountain chains are the Guadarrama, separating this province from Madrid; the Paramera and de vila, west of the Guadarrama; andthe vast wall of the de Gredos along the southern frontier, where its outstanding peaks rise to 6000 or even 8000 ft. Almanzor is the highest point. The ridges which ramify from the Paramera are covered with valuable forests of beeches, oaks and firs, presenting a striking contrast to the bare peaks of the Sierra de Gredos. The principal rivers are the Alberche and  Titar, belonging to the basin of the Tagus,and the Trmes, Trabncos and  Adaja, belonging to that of the Douro. The mountains contain silver, copper, iron, lead and coal, but their mineral wealth has been exaggerated, and at thebeginning of the 20th century mining had practically been abandoned. Quarries of fine marble and jasper exist in the district of Arenas.HistoryThe province declined in wealth and population during the 18th and 19th centuries, a result due less to the want of activity on the part of the inhabitants than to the oppressive manorial and feudal rights and the strict laws of entail and mortmain, which acted as barriers to progress.See also*of municipalities in vila*de Gredos*of GuisandoReferences* ()dviladvilaSngdvila(provins)vilaprovintsde vilaAviloprobintzia()dvilade vila(pokrajina)di vilade Aviladi vila(lalawigan)wa vilade Avila(provincia)vila(provincie)ja:(provins)(provncia)vila(provncia)vila()Province(maakunta)(provins)(il)()(tnh)de vilazh:

Laogai
Laogai (plogi), the abbreviation for  Lodng Gizo (/), which means reform through labor, is a slogan of the Chinese criminal justice system and has been used to refer to the use of prison labor and farms in the Republic of China (PRC).  It is estimated that in the last fifty years more than 50 million people have been sent to laogai camps.(Lewis, Aaron. (October 5, 2005).  Inside the Lao Gai.  Special Broadcasting Service.  Retrieved on 2008-10-16.) Laogai is distinguished from laojiao, or through labor, which is an administrative detention for a person who is not a criminal but has committed minor offenses, and is intended to reform offenders into law-abiding citizens.()  Persons detained under laojiao are detained in facilities which are separate from the general prison system of laogai. Both systems, however, involve penal labor.In 1990 China abandoned the term laogai and started labelling the facilities as prisons instead.(   Translated from Chinese, original source was )  Chinas 1997 revised Criminal Procedure Law brought an end to official laogai policy, but some prisons in the Autonomous Region and in Qinghai still practice forced labor and amount to a continuation of laogai.( (Archived).)HistoryDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Chinese prisons, organized like factories, contained large numbers of people who were considered to be too critical of the government or counter-revolutionary. However, many people arrested for political or religious reasons were released in the late 1970s at the start of the Xiaoping reforms.There are accusations that Chinese prisons produce products that are often sold in foreign countries, with the profits going to the PRC government.(Forced Labor in China.  Congressional-Executive Commission on China.  Retrieved on 2008-10-16.  Full transcript of the roundtable session available.)  Products include everything from tea to industrial engines to coal dug from mines.()  In addition to the fact that the same practice is found in Western countries (the making of license plates in the US for example), the products made in laogai camps make up only an insignificant amount of Chinas export output and domestic product, according to researchers James D. Seymour and Richard Anderson.() It has been argued that the use of prison labor for manufacturing is not itself a violation of rights and that most prisoners in Chinese prisons are there for what are generally regarded as crimes in the West. Western criticism of the laogai centers not only on the export of products made by forced labor, but also on the claims of detainees being held for political or religious violations, such as leadership of unregistered House Churches.()  While the laogai has attracted widespread criticism for the poor conditions in the prisons, Seymour and Anderson claim that reports are exaggerated, stating that even at its worst, the laogai is not, as some have claimed, the Chinese equivalent of the Soviet gulag.(The downfall of socialism has reduced revenue to local governments, increasing pressure for local governments to attempt to supplement their income using prison labor. At the same time, prisoners usually do not make a good workforce, and the products produced by prison labor in China are of extremely low quality and have become unsalable on the open market in competition with products made by non-imprisoned paid labor.()An insiders view from the 50s to the 1990s is detailed in the books of Wu, including Troublemaker and Laogai. Wu spent nineteen years, from 1960 to 1979, as a prisoner in these camps for criticizing the government while he was a young college student.() Almost starving to death, he eventually escaped to the US.In The Unknown Story, Mao biographer Chang and historian Halliday estimate that perhaps 27 million people died in prisons and labor camps during Mao Tse-tungs rule.(Chang, Jung and Halliday, Jon. The Unknown Story. Cape, London, 2005. p. 338: By the general estimate Chinas prison and labor camp population was roughly 10 million in any one year under Mao. Descriptions of camp life by inmates, which point to high mortality rates, indicate a probable annual death rate of at least 10 per cent.) They claim that inmates were subjected to back-breaking labor in the most hostile wastelands, and that executions and suicides by any means (like diving into a wheat chopper) were commonplace.( Jean-Louis Margolin writing in Black Book of Communism, which describes the history of repressions by Communist states, claims that perhaps 20 million died in the prison system.(Courtois, Jean-Louis Margolin, et al. Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression. University Press, 1999. ISBN 0-674-07608-7 p. 464) Professor Rummel puts the number of forced labor democides at 15,720,000, excluding all those collectivized, ill-fed and clothed peasants who would be worked to death in the fields.(Rummel, R. J. Chinas Bloody Century: Genocide and Mass Murder Since 1900 Publishers, 1991. ISBN 0-88738-417-X pp. 214-215) Wu puts the death toll at 15 million.(Aikman, David. The Laogai Archipelago. Weekly Standard. 29, 1997.)Currently, the Research Foundation, a human rights NGO located in DC, estimates that there are approximately 1,045 laogai facilities in China,( p. 6.) containing an estimated 6.8 million detainees,() although the actual number of detainees is uncertain.(Conditions in Laogai campsThe conditions that Laogai prisoners live in have been under scrutiny as the world learns more about them. The Chinese government has stated Our economic theory holds that the human being is the most fundamental productive force. Except for those who must be exterminated physically out of political consideration, human beings must be utilized as productive forces, with submissiveness as the prerequisite. The Laogai systems fundamental policy is Forced Labor as a means, while Thought Reform is our basic aim.(The Other Gulag. By: Wu, Harry, National Review, 00280038, 4/5/1999, Vol. 51, Issue 6)ClothingUnlike Laojiao inmates, Laogai criminals are issued clothing. Depending on the locale and its economic situation, it can range significantly: Some prisoners may receive black or grey while others wear dark red or blue. Also depending on location, the clothing is available in different thicknesses. Commonly stamped on the uniforms are the Chinese characters for fan and lao gai meaning criminal and reform through labor, respectively.(Williams, Philip F., and Yenna Wu. The Great Wall of Confinement: The Chinese Prison Camp Through Contemporary Fiction and Reportage. Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 2004. Print.) Also issued to the prisoners are a pair of shoes made of rubber or plastic.(Wu, Hongda Harry. Laogai - The Chinese Gulag. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, Inc., 1992. Print.) These minimums do not meet the needs of the prisoners, who must purchase underclothes, socks, hats and jackets with their meager monthly earnings of 2.5-3 yuan ($0.37-$0.44 USD as of April 11, 2009).(( To make escapees easily identifiable, the Chinese have adopted the practice of shaving prisoners heads, a practice inherited from the Soviet Gulag and/or Tsarist Katorga. Jackets were rare in the Mao era and were commonly made from patches of old blankets rather than from original cloth. Washing clothes was also rare, but clothing supplies in prisons have improved since the mid-Deng-Jiang Era.(FoodFood distribution has varied much through time similar to its variation across the over 1,155 documented laogai camps.(Chinese slaves make goods for American malls. By: Chapman, Michael, Human Events, 00187194, 07/04/97, Vol. 53, Issue 25.) One near Beijing distributes between 13.5 and 22.5 kg of food per person per month. This is about average. The 1food is sorghum and corn, which are ground into flour and made into bread or gruel. The prisoners of this camp also receive three ounces of cooking oil per month. Every two weeks, the prisoners receive a special meal of pork broth soup and white-flour steamed buns. Important Chinese holidays such as New Years, National Day, and the Spring Festival are celebrated with meat dumplings, a special treat in an otherwise meatless diet.(Food is distributed by one person per squad, a squad consisting of about ten people. This prisoner, called the zhiban or duty prisoner, delivers the food to the rest of his group in large bowls on a cart. This often involves pushing the cart a great distance to the place where the others are working.( Each day prisoners receive gruel, bread, and a watery vegetable soup made from the cheapest vegetables available. Some camps have reported two meals a day while others allow three.(( Food is rationed according to rank and productive output, which provides motivation to work.During the Mao era, food in prisons was very scarce, partly because of a nationwide famine (19591962) but also because of the harsher rules. Since so little food was available, prisoners would scavenge anything they came across while working. There are documented cases of prisoners eating field mice, crickets, locusts, toads, grapevine worms, grasshoppers, insect larvae and eggs, and poisonous snakes.( Also, many inmates would steal produce from the fields they worked on, smuggling vegetables back to their barracks.  In Jiabiangou, Gansu, around 2,500 out of 3,000 prisoners died of starvation between 1960 and 1962, with some survivors resorting to cannibalism.(Howard W. French (2009): Survivors Stories From China, New York Times, New York Edition, August 25, 2009, page C1)Nutrition in the camps was a big problem, especially during the early 1950s through the 60s, the early years  of the PRC (Peoples Republic of China). Before the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) took control, hunger was rarely used to control prisoners.( Early leaders of the CCP realized the power of withholding food from rebellious prisoners, and until recently, this practice was very common. Some camps in coastal regions have improved the quality and amount of food very much since the early nineties.(Living quarters and sanitationThe living quarters, commonly referred to as barracks in most Laogai literature, are relatively primitive. Most have floors made of cement or wood but some are of only straw and/or earth. The latrine is a bucket, and there is no furniture. The prisoners sleep on the floor in a space 30 cm wide,( with ten people per room.( New prisoners are forced to sleep nearest to the latrine while more experienced ones sleep near the opposite wall.(Baths and showers are very rare, often not mentioned at all in memoirs. The only form of washing is the use of a water basin, which is only slightly less rare. This however, is ineffective since the same water is used for an entire squad. Basic essentials such as a toothbrush and toothpaste, toilet paper, soap and towels are not provided, prisoners must spend their wages to acquire them.( There are documented cases of prisoners spreading manure, both human and animal, then eating immediately without being able to wash their hands.(The sleeping quarters are surrounded on all sides by a wall. This wall is about 20 feet high and topped with electrical fencing. There are also sentry towers on each corner. Outside this wall is forty feet of empty space, followed by another wall, similar to the first but larger.(Disease and pestsThe Laogai camps are infested with many types of pests. bugs are so numerous that at night they sometimes move in swarms. This behavior has earned them the Laogai nickname of tanks or tanke.( They suck the blood of the prisoners, leaving little red welts all over their bodies. These welts itch, and severe cases have led to inmates scratching their skin raw, leading to dangerous infections. Another common pest is lice, and so much so that the convicts have been known to eat them to supplement their meager diet. No insecticide or pesticides are used in the camps; these bugs are allowed to run rampant in the population of prisoners. One prisoner, Zhang Xianliang, wrote that the parasites on a single inmates underpants would be as numerous as the words on the front page of a newspaper. He also noted fleas would be so numerous that they would turn his quilt purplish black with their droppings.( Roundworms are also a common threat to the prisoners health, especially in laogai farms where human excrement is used as fertilizer.(Along with a poor diet comes many diet-related diseases. Beriberi, edema, and scurvy are the most common from lack of vitamins.( Other health problems caused by the lack of healthy food include severe diarrhea or constipation from the lack of oil and fiber. These two are often left untreated and the continuous strain of twelve hours of manual labor weakens the immune system. Eventually, death follows many of these conditions.( Two diseases rampant among the populations of these camps are tuberculosis and hepatitis. Highly contagious, these are also often left untreated until it is too late. Each morning, the cadre of the camp decides who is sick enough to stay in the barracks and miss the day of work. Many prisoners are forced to work when they are ill.( Mental illness used to be very common during the Mao era when prisoners would spend two hours each evening being indoctrinated. The brainwashing that occurred over the amount of time people were imprisoned could be so intense that they were driven to insanity and in many cases suicide.(Reforming through laborIt is the practice of forced labor that defines Laogai prison camps.  The following is a description of an average day in the prison camp Tuanhe Farm by Harry Wu, executive director of the LRF (Laogai Research Foundation). He spent nineteen years in a Laogai prison camp like this one.Prisoners are roused from bed at 5:30 AM, and at 6:00 the zhiban from the kitchen wheels in a cart with tubs of corn gruel and cornbread  at 7:00 the company public security cadre (captain) comes in, gathers all the prisoners together, and authorizes any sick prisoners to remain in the barracks. Once at the worksite, the captain delegates production responsibilities At lunchtime the zhiban arrives pulling a handcart with a large tub of vegetable soup, two hunks of cornbread for each prisoner, and a large tube of drinking water  after about thirty minutes, work is resumed until the company chief announces quitting time in the evening. Generally the prisoners return to the barracks at about 6:30 PM.Upon return it is once again a dinner of cornbread, corn gruel, and vegetable soup.At 7:30, the two-hour study period beginsAt 9:30, no matter what the weather, all prisoners gather together outside the barracks for roll call and a speech from the captain. At around 10:00 everyone goes to bed.During the night no lights are allowed and no one is allowed to move about. One must remain in ones assigned sleeping place and wait until 5:30 the next morning before getting up, when the whole cycle begins again.(Quota filling is a big part of the inmates lives in Laogai camps. Undershooting or overshooting the target productivity governs their quality of life. Not making the number may result in solitary confinement or loss of food privileges. Generally, food rations are cut by 10-20% if a worker fails to meet the standard. Some prisoners excel and are able to do more than what is required of them. They sometimes receive extra or better quality food. It has been argued that this extra food is not worth the extra calories burned to be more productive, so many prisoners choose to do the minimum with minimum effort, thereby saving as much energy as possible.(Working conditions in Laogai camps are sub-standard. Investigators from the Laogai Research Foundation have confirmed sites where prisoners mine asbestos and other toxic chemicals with no protective gear, work with batteries and battery acid with no protection for their hands, tan hides while standing naked in vats filled three-feet deep with chemicals used for the softening of animal skins, and work in improperly run mining facilities where explosions and other accidents are a common occurrence.(Career preparation has historically been used to justify forced labor prison systems around the world. In China, although this argument was used, career preparation was minimal until recently. Following release, the skills acquired within the Laogai prison (i.e. ditch-digging or manure-spreading) do not often lead to desirable employment. Inmates who entered the Laogai system with marketable skills were often assigned jobs utilizing these skills within the prison complex. Doctors, for example, were doctors within the Laogai camp often receiving preferential treatment, larger amounts of food, similar to the cadre, and a bed. Inmates rarely leave with any new skills unless the training fits the camps enterprising needs.( More recently however, programs have been introduced to train prisoners in useful trades.(While there are many types of Laogai complexes, most enterprises are farms, mines or factories. There are, according to the Chinese government, approximately 200 different kinds of Laogai products that are exported to international markets.( A quarter of Chinas tea is produced in Laogai camps; 60 percent of Chinas rubber-vulcanizing chemicals are produced in a single Laogai camp in Shengyang  one of the largest steel-pipe factories in the country is a Laogai camp  ( One Camp alone, Ziangride, harvests more than 22,000 metric tons of grain every year.(By Ian Johnson. Chinas Prison Camps Turn to Commerce --- Forced Labor Helps Settle Unexploited Regions.  Wall Street Journal, 14  Aug. 1998, Eastern edition: A13. ABI/INFORM Global. ProQuest.) Dulan County prisoners have planted over 400,000 trees.(The conditions in these camps are considered extremely harsh by most cultures of the world. However, the Chinese government considers Laogai to be effective in controlling prisoners and furthering Chinas economy. In the words of Mao Zedong, The Laogai facilities are one of the violent component parts of the state machine. Laogai facilities of all levels are established as tools representing the interests of the proletariat and the peoples masses and exercising dictatorship over a minority of hostile elements originating from exploiter classes.( Activist Wu has catalyzed the debate on the issue of Laogai, which is now becoming a more visible issue worldwide.Other information*In 2003, the word laogai entered the English Dictionary.  It entered the German Duden Die deutsche Rechtschreibung in 2005,( p. 25&ndash;6.) and French and Italian dictionaries in 2006.( English summary: Congratulations!

Rare_earth_element
File:Rareearthoxides.jpg|thumb|These rare-earth oxides are used as tracers to determine which parts of a basin are eroding. Clockwise from top center: praseodymium, cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, samarium, and gadolinium.()As defined by IUPAC, rare earth elements or rare earth metals are a set of seventeen elements in the table, specifically the fifteen lanthanides plus scandium and yttrium.() Scandium and yttrium are considered rare earth elements since they tend to occur in the same ore deposits as the lanthanides and exhibit similar chemical properties.Despite their name, rare earth elements (with the exception of the radioactive promethium) are relatively plentiful in the Earths crust, with cerium being the 25th most abundant element at 68 parts per million (similar to copper). However, because of their geochemical properties, rare earth elements are typically dispersed and not often found in concentrated and economically exploitable forms. The few economically exploitable deposits are known as earth minerals.(Rare Earth ElementsCritical Resources for High Technology U.S. Geological Survey, Fact Sheet 087-02) It was the very scarcity of these minerals (previously called earths) that led to the term rare earth.  The first such mineral discovered was gadolinite, a compound of cerium, yttrium, iron, silicon and other elements.  This mineral was extracted from a mine in the village of Ytterby in Sweden; many of the rare earth elements bear names derived from this location.ListA table listing the seventeen rare earth elements, their atomic number and symbol, the etymology of their names, and their main usages (see also Lanthanide#Technological_applications) is provided here. Some of the rare earths are named for the scientists who discovered or elucidated their elemental properties, and some for their geographical discovery.AbbreviationsThe following abbreviations are often used:*RE  rare earth*REM  rare earth metals*REE  rare earth elements*REO  rare earth oxides*REY  rare earth elements and yttrium*LREE  light rare earth elements (La-Eu)*HREE  heavy rare earth elements (Gd-Lu and Y)Discovery and early historyRare earth elements became known to the world with the discovery of the black mineral ytterbite (renamed to gadolinite in 1800) by Lieutenant Axel Arrhenius in 1787, at a quarry in the village of Sweden.()Arrhenius ytterbite reached Gadolin, a Royal Academy of Turku professor, and his analysis yielded an unknown oxide (earth) which he called Ytteria. Gustav Ekeberg isolated beryllium from the gadolinite but failed to recognize other elements which the ore contained. After this discovery in 1794 a mineral from Bastns near Riddarhyttan, Sweden, which was believed to be an iron-tungsten mineral, was re-examined by Jacob Berzelius and Hisinger. In 1803 they obtained a white oxide and called it ceria. Heinrich Klaproth independently discovered the same oxide and called it ochroia.Thus by 1803 there were two known rare earth elements, yttrium and cerium, although it took another 30 years for researchers to determine that other elements were contained in the two ores ceria and ytteria (the similarity of the rare earth metals chemical properties made their separation difficult).In 1839 Gustav Mosander, an assistant of Berzelius, separated ceria by heating the nitrate and dissolving the product in acid. He called the oxide of the soluble salt lanthana. It took him three more years to separate the lanthana further into didymia and pure lanthana. Didymia, although not further separable by Mosanders techniques was a mixture of oxides.In 1842 Mosander also separated the ytteria into three oxides: pure ytteria, terbia and erbia (all the names are derived from the town name Ytterby). The earth giving pink salts he called terbium; the one which yielded yellow peroxide he called erbium.So in 1842 the number of rare earth elements had reached six: yttrium, cerium, lanthanum, didymium, erbium and terbium.Johan Berlin and Delafontaine tried also to separate the crude ytteria and found the same substances that Mosander obtained, but Berlin named (1860) the substance giving pink salts erbium and Delafontaine named the substance with the yellow peroxide terbium. This confusion led to several false claims of new elements, such as the mosandrium of J. Lawrence Smith, or the philippium and decipium of Delafontaine.There were no further discoveries for 30 years, and the element didymium was listed in the periodic table of elements with a molecular mass of 138. In 1879 Delafontaine used the new physical process of optical-flame spectroscopy, and he found several new spectral lines in didymia. Also in 1879, the new element samarium was isolated by mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran from the mineral samarskite.The samaria earth was further separated by Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1886 and a similar result was obtained by Charles Galissard de Marignac by direct isolation from samarskite. They named the element gadolinium after Gadolin, and its oxide was named gadolinia.Further spectroscopic analysis between 1886 and 1901 of samaria, ytteria, and samarskite by Crookes, Lecoq de Boisbaudran and Demaray yielded several new spectroscopic lines that indicated the existence of an unknown element. The fractional crystallization of the oxides then yielded europium in 1901.In 1839 the third source for rare earths became available. This is a mineral similar to gadolinite, uranotantalum (now called samarskite). This mineral from Miass in the southern Mountains was documented by Gustave Rose. The Russian chemist R. Harmann proposed that a new element he called ilmenium should be present in this mineral, but later, Wilhelm Blomstrand, Galissard de Marignac, and Rose found only tantalum and niobium (columbium) in it.The exact number of rare earth elements that existed was highly unclear, and a maximum number of 25 was estimated. The use of X-ray spectra (obtained by crystallography) by Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley made it possible to assign numbers to the elements. Moseley found that the exact number of lanthanides had to be 15 and that 61 had yet to be discovered.Using these facts about atomic numbers from X-ray crystallography, Moseley also showed that hafnium (element 72) would not be a rare earth element. Moseley was killed in War I in 1915, years before hafnium was discovered. Hence, the claim of Urbain that he had discovered element 72 was untrue. Hafnium is an element that lies in the periodic table immediately below zirconium, and hafnium and zirconium are very similar in their chemical and physical properties.During the 1940s, Spedding and others in the States (during the Project) developed the chemical exchange procedures for separating and purifying the rare earth elements. This method was first applied to the actinides for separating plutonium-239 and neptunium, from uranium, thorium, actinium, and the other actinide rare earths in the materials produced in reactors. The plutonium-239 was very desirable because it is a material.The principal sources of rare earth elements are the minerals bastnsite, monazite, and loparite and the lateritic ion-adsorption clays. Despite their high relative abundance, earth minerals are more difficult to mine and extract than equivalent sources of metals (due in part to their similar chemical properties), making the rare earth elements relatively expensive. Their industrial use was very limited until efficient separation techniques were developed, such as exchange, fractional crystallization and extraction during the late 1950s and early 1960s.(Spedding F, Daane AH: The Rare Earths, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1961) Origin Rare earth elements are heavier than iron and thus are produced by nucleosynthesis or the s-process in giant branch stars. In nature, fission of uranium-238 produces trace amounts of radioactive promethium, but most promethium is synthetically produced in nuclear reactors.Geological distributionRare earth cerium is actually the 25th most abundant element in the Earths crust, having 68 parts per million (about as common as copper). Only the highly unstable and radioactive promethium rare earth is quite scarce.The rare earth elements are often found together. The longest-lived isotope of promethium has a half life of 17.7 years, so the element only exists in nature in negligible amounts (approximately 572 g in the entire Earths crust).() Promethium is one of the two elements that do not have stable (non-radioactive) isotopes and are followed by (i.e. with higher atomic number) stable elements.Due to contraction, yttrium, which is trivalent, is of similar ionic size to dysprosium and its lanthanide neighbors. Due to the relatively gradual decrease in ionic size with increasing atomic number, the rare earth elements have always been difficult to separate. Even with eons of geological time, geochemical separation of the lanthanides has only rarely progressed much farther than a broad separation between light versus heavy lanthanides, otherwise known as the cerium and yttrium earths. This geochemical divide is reflected in the first two rare earths that were discovered, yttria in 1794 and ceria in 1803. As originally found, each comprised the entire mixture of the associated earths. Rare earth minerals, as found, usually are dominated by one group or the other, depending upon which size-range best fits the structural lattice. Thus, among the anhydrous rare earth phosphates, it is the tetragonal mineral xenotime that incorporates yttrium and the yttrium earths, whereas the monoclinic monazite phase incorporates cerium and the cerium earths preferentially. The smaller size of the yttrium group allows it a greater solid solubility in the rock-forming minerals that comprise the Earths mantle, and thus yttrium and the yttrium earths show less enrichment in the Earths crust relative to chondritic abundance, than does cerium and the cerium earths. This has economic consequences: large ore bodies of the cerium earths are known around the world, and are being exploited. Corresponding orebodies for yttrium tend to be rarer, smaller, and less concentrated. Most of the current supply of yttrium originates in the ion adsorption clay ores of Southern China. Some versions provide concentrates containing about 65% yttrium oxide, with the heavy lanthanides being present in ratios reflecting the rule: even-numbered heavy lanthanides at abundances of about 5% each, and odd-numbered lanthanides at abundances of about 1% each. Similar compositions are found in xenotime or gadolinite.Well-known minerals containing yttrium include gadolinite, xenotime, samarskite, euxenite, fergusonite, yttrotantalite, yttrotungstite, yttrofluorite (a variety of fluorite), thalenite, yttrialite. Small amounts occur in zircon, which derives its typical yellow fluorescence from some of the accompanying heavy lanthanides. The zirconium mineral eudialyte, such as is found in southern Greenland, contains small but potentially useful amounts of yttrium. Of the above yttrium minerals, most played a part in providing research quantities of lanthanides during the discovery days. Xenotime is occasionally recovered as a byproduct of heavy sand processing, but is not as abundant as the similarly recovered monazite (which typically contains a few percent of yttrium). Uranium ores from Ontario have occasionally yielded yttrium as a byproduct.Well-known minerals containing cerium and the light lanthanides include bastnaesite, monazite, allanite, loparite, ancylite, parisite, lanthanite, chevkinite, cerite, stillwellite, britholite, fluocerite, and cerianite. Monazite (marine sands from Brazil, India, or Australia; rock from Africa), bastnaesite (from Mountain Pass, California, or several localities in China), and loparite (Peninsula, Russia) have been the principal ores of cerium and the light lanthanides.In 2011, Yasuhiro Kato, a geologist at the of Tokyo who led a study of Pacific Ocean seabed mud, published results indicating the mud could hold rich concentrations of rare earth minerals. The deposits, studied at 78 sites, came from hot plumes from hydrothermal vents pulling these materials out of seawater and depositing them on the seafloor, bit by bit, over tens of millions of years. One square patch of metal-rich mud 2.3 kilometers wide might contain enough rare earths to meet most of the global demand for a year, Japanese geologists report July 3 in Geoscience. I believe that rare earth resources undersea are much more promising than on-land resources, said Kato. Concentrations of rare earths were comparable to those found in clays mined in China. Some deposits contained twice as much heavy rare earths such as dysprosium, a component of magnets in hybrid car motors.(Powell, Devin, Rare earth elements plentiful in ocean sediments, ScienceNews, July 3rd, 2011.

The country currently exports around 3,000 tonnes per year, representing around 2% of world production.()reprocessing is another potential source of rare earth or any other elements. fission of uranium or plutonium produces a full range of elements, including all their isotopes. However, due to the radioactivity of many of these isotopes, it is unlikely that extracting them from the mixture can be done safely and economically.Environmental considerationsMining, refining, and recycling of rare earths have serious environmental consequences if not properly managed. A particular hazard is mildly radioactive slurry tailings resulting from the common occurrence of thorium and uranium in rare earth element ores.(Bourzac, Katherine. Can the U.S. Rare-Earth Industry Rebound? Technology Review. October 29, 2010.) Additionally, toxic acids are required during the refining process.( Improper handling of these substances can result in extensive environmental damage. In May 2010, China announced a major, five-month crackdown on illegal mining in order to protect the environment and its resources. This campaign is expected to be concentrated in the South,(Govt cracks whip on rare earth mining. China Daily, May 21, 2010. Accessed June 3rd, 2010.) where mines  commonly small, rural, and illegal operations  are particularly prone to releasing toxic wastes into the general water supply.((Y, Lee. South China Villagers Slam Pollution From Rare Earth Mine. 22 February 2008. RFA English Website. 16 March 2008) However, even the major operation in Baotou, in Inner Mongolia, where much of the worlds rare earth supply is refined, has caused major environmental damage.()The Bukit Merah mine in Malaysia has been the focus of a US$100 million cleanup which is proceeding in 2011. Residents blamed a rare earth refinery for defects and eight leukemia cases within five years in a community of 11,000  after many years with no leukemia cases. Seven of the leukemia victims died. After having accomplished the hilltop entombment of 11,000 truckloads of radioactively contaminated material, the project is expected to entail in summer, 2011, the removal of more than 80,000 steel barrels of radioactive waste to the hilltop repository. One of Mitsubishis contractors for the cleanup is GeoSyntec, an Atlanta-based firm.( Osamu Shimizu, a director of Asian Rare Earth, said the company might have sold a few bags of calcium phosphate fertilizer on a trial basis as it sought to market byproducts in reply to a former resident of Bukit Merah who said, The cows that ate the grass with the fertilizer all died.(In May 2011, after the Daiichi nuclear disaster, widespread protests took place in Kuantan over the Lynas refinery and radioactive waste from it. The ore to be processed has very low levels of thorium, and Lynas founder and chief executive Nicholas Curtis said There is absolutely no risk to public health. T. Jayabalan, a doctor who says he has been monitoring and treating patients affected by the Mitsubishi plant, is wary of Lynass assurances. The argument that low levels of thorium in the ore make it safer doesnt make sense, he says, because radiation exposure is cumulative.(Lee, Yoolim, Malaysia Rare Earths in Largest Would-Be Refinery Incite Protest, Bloomberg Markets Magazine, May 31, 2011 5:00 PM ET.) Construction of the facility has been halted until an independent Nations IAEA panel investigation is completed, which is expected by the end of June 2011.(UN investigation into Malaysia rare-earth plant safety, BBC, 30 May 2011 05:52 ET.) New restrictions were announced by the Malaysian government in late June.(IAEA panel investigation is completed and no construction has been halted. Lynas is on budget and on schedule to start producing 2011. The IAEA report has concluded in a report issued by the nuclear watchdog Thursday June 2011 said it did not find any instance of any non-compliance with international radiation safety standards in the project.(IAEA Submits Lynas Report to Malaysian Government. Iaea.org (2011-06-29). Retrieved on 2011-09-27.)Geo-political considerationsChina has officially cited resource depletion and environmental concerns as the reasons for a nationwide crackdown on its rare earth mineral production sector.() However, non-environmental motives have also been imputed to Chinas rare earth policy.( According to Economist, Slashing their exports of rare-earth metals...is all about moving Chinese manufacturers up the supply chain, so they can sell valuable finished goods to the world rather than lowly raw materials.(The Difference Engine: More precious than gold. Economist September 17, 2010.) One possible example is the division of General Motors which deals with miniaturized magnet research, which shut down its US office and moved its entire staff to China in 2006.(C, Cox. Rare earth innovation: the silent shift to China. 16 November 2006. The Anchor House: Research on Rare Earth Elements. Accessed 29 February 2008)It was reported,() but officially denied,() that China instituted an export ban on shipments of rare earth oxides (but not alloys) to Japan on 22 September 2010, in response to the detainment of a Chinese fishing boat captain by the Coast Guard.(Backlash over the alleged China curb on metal exports, Telegraph, London, 29 Aug 2010. Retrieved 2010-08-30.) On September 2, 2010, a few days before the fishing boat incident, The Economist reported that China...in July announced the latest in a series of annual export reductions, this time by 40% to precisely 30,258 tonnes.(Rare earths: Digging in Economist September 2, 2010)The States Department of Energy in its 2010 Critical Materials Strategy report identified dysprosium as the element that was most critical in terms of import reliance.(Mills, Mark P. Techs Mineral Infrastructure  Time to Emulate Chinas Rare Earth Policies. Forbes, 1 January 2010.)A 2011 report issued by the U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Department of the Interior, Chinas Rare-Earth Industry, outlines  industry trends within China and examines national policies that may guide the future of the countrys production. The report notes that Chinas lead in the production of rare-earth minerals has accelerated over the past two decades. In 1990, China accounted for only 27% of such minerals. In 2009, world production was 132,000 metric tons; China produced 129,000 of those tons. According to the report, recent patterns suggest that China will slow the export of such materials to the world: Owing to the increase in domestic demand, the Government has gradually reduced the export quota during the past several years. In 2006, China allowed 47 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 12 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers to export. Controls have since tightened annually; by 2011, only 22 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 9 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers were authorized. The governments future policies will likely keep in place strict controls: According to Chinas draft rare-earth development plan, annual rare-earth production may be limited to between 130,000 and 140,000 tons during the period from 2009 to 2015. The export quota for rare-earth products may be about 35,000 tons and the Government may allow 20 domestic rare-earth producers and traders to export rare earths. ()The United States Geological Survey is actively surveying southern Afghanistan for rare earth deposits under the protection of United States military forces.  Since 2009 the USGS has conducted remote sensing surveys as well as fieldwork to verify Soviet claims that volcanic rocks containing rare earth metals exist in Helmand province near the village of Khanneshin.  The USGS study team has located a sizable area of rocks in the center of an extinct volcano containing light rare earth elements including cerium and neodymium.  It has mapped 1.3 million metric tons of desirable rock, or about 10 years of supply at current demand levels. The Pentagon has estimated its value at about $7.4 billion. (Simpson, S.: Afghanistans Buried Riches, Scientific American, October 2011 )Rare earth pricingRare earth elements are not exchange traded in the same way that precious (for instance, gold and silver) or non-ferrous metals (such as nickel, tin, copper, and aluminum) are.  Instead they are sold on the private market, which makes their prices difficult to monitor and track.  However, prices are published periodically on websites such as mineralprices.com.( The 17 elements are not usually sold in their pure form, but instead are distributed in mixtures of varying purity, e.g. Neodymium metal  99.5%.(Price list on mineralprices.com.) As such pricing can vary based on the quantity and quality required by the end users application.ReservesAccording to the US Geological Survey, shortage of some of the worlds rare earth metals (along with other metals) will be felt within 50 years of 2009.

George_Alexander_Parks
George Alexander Parks (May 29, 1883  May 11, 1984) was an American engineer who worked in Territory for most of his career.  Following an unexpected nomination from President Coolidge, he became the territorys first resident governor.  As governor, he was the first person to serve two complete four-year terms and the first chief executive to travel extensively by air.()BackgroundParks was born to James and Mary Leach (Ferguson) Parks on May 29, 1883 in Denver, Colorado.  He was educated in public schools before graduating from the School of Mines in 1906.  After graduation he worked as a mining engineer in Canada, Mexico, and the Western United States before arriving in Alaska in 1907 as part of an engineering team tasked with making evaluations for a group of investors.()  In 1908, Parks worked for the States Land Office in Denver as a mineral examiner for two months before taking a similar position in Alaska.(  Following the American entry into World War I, he joined the Corps of Engineers.()  Rising to the rank of captain by the wars end, he returned to the Land office after his military service.(In 1920, Parks was appointed Chief of the States Land Office in Juneau. Four years later he was in Anchorage working as Assistant Supervisor of Surveys of Public Lands for Alaska.(  During his time with the land office, he traveled extensively throughout the territory, gaining an intimate knowledge of the geography and becoming acquainted with both the white and indigenous populations of Alaska.()GovernorshipWhile President G. Harding, Work, and Hoover were visiting Alaska, Parks was assigned as a tour guide for the dignitaries.  The group was impressed by their guides detailed knowledge of the territory.  When President Coolidge was later looking for a new territorial governor, Work and Hoover, who by then were both members of the Cabinet, recommended Parks.(  Coolidge nominated Parks to be Governor of Alaska Territory on February 14, 1925  and the new governor took his oath of office on June 17, 1925.()()Transportation was a major issue for the territory during the Parks administration.  To offset running deficits and reduced federal subsidies, rates for the Railroad were raised and a toll was implemented on the Highway.  One area that saw an improvement however was air travel.  In 1925 funds for landing fields was authorized by the territorial legislature.  Two years later subsidized air travel between the Alaska Railroad and Peninsula was initiated.  Parks became an avid enthusiast of air travel, using it to inspect much of the territory in May and June 1929.(  The speed and increased mobility even allowed him to attend his nieces graduation in California.()Much of Parks term of office was largely uneventful.  Among the issues he dealt with were the reduction in federal funding for the States Geological Survey and elimination of the territorys agricultural experimentation stations.(  He also initiated a contest among school children to design a territorial flag.()Parks was reappointed for a second term by President Hoover on September 27, 1929.()  He left office on April 19, 1933 following the completion of his term.((Later lifeAfter leaving the governors office, Parks settled in Juneau and became District Cadastral Engineer of Alaska.(  He remained there until his retirement from the of Land Management in July 1948.()  After leaving government service, he worked for the R.J. Sommers Construction Company and became Vice-President of the First National Bank of Juneau.(During the mid 1970s, Parks was forced to leave his Juneau apartment and move into a home.  In 1975, the  Parks Highway (Alaska Route 3) between Anchorage and Alaska was named in his honor.()  Parks died on May 11, 1984 at the age of 100 in Juneau, Alaska.(ReferencesExternal links* Alaskas Digital Archives  Photo taken May 29, 1982, as incumbent governor Hammond and others celebrate his 99th birthday.

Treaty_of_Frankfurt_(1871)
The Treaty of Frankfurt (; ) was a treaty signed in Frankfurt on 10 May 1871, at the end of the War.  Summary The treaty did the following:* Established the frontier between the Third Republic and the Empire, which involved the ceding of 1,694 villages and cities under French control to Germany in::* Alsace: the French departments of Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin, except for the city of Belfort and its territory;:* Lorraine: the French department of Moselle, one-third of the department of Meurthe, including the cities of Chteau-Salins and Sarrebourg, and the arrondissements Saales and Schirmeck in the department of Vosges. * Gave residents of the returned Alsace-Lorraine region until 1 October 1872 to decide between keeping their French nationality and emigrating, or remaining in the region and becoming German citizens.* Set a framework for the withdrawal of German troops from certain areas.* Regulated the payment of Frances war indemnity of five billion francs (due within three years).* Recognized the acceptance of William I of Prussia as German Emperor.* Required military occupation in parts of France until the indemnity was paid (to the surprise of Germany, the French paid the indemnity quickly).The treaty also established the terms for the following:* The use of navigable waterways in connection to Alsace-Lorraine * Trade between the two countries* The return of prisoners of war Factors that influenced the boundary  Strategy The German military spoke up for control of the Alsace region, up to the Vosges (mountain range) and the area between Thionville (Diedenhofen) and Metz as a requirement for the protection of Germany. Most importantly, the German military regarded control of the route between Thionville and Metz as the most important area of control if there were ever to be a future war with France. (Hawthorne, 217) Politics Without a westward shift in the boundary the new empires frontier with France would have been largely divided between the states of Baden and Bavaria, whose governments were less than enthusiastic with the prospect of having a vengeful France on their doorstep.  It also would have necessitated the stationing of substantial Imperial forces within these states borders, possibly compromising their ability to exercise the considerable autonomy the southern states were able to maintain in the unification treaty.  A shift in the frontier alleviated these issues. Nationalism The new political border largely (though not entirely) followed the linguistic border.  The fact that the majority of the population in the new Imperial Territory (Reichsland) territory spoke dialects allowed Berlin to justify the annexation on nationalistic grounds. Economy Natural resources in Alsace-Lorraine (iron-ore, and coal) do not appear to have played a role in Germanys fight for the areas annexed.(Hawthorne, 248) Military annexation was the main stated goal along with unification of the German people.At the same time, France lost 1,447,000 hectares, 1,694 villages and 1,597,000 inhabitants. It also lost 20% of its mining and steel potential.The treaty of trade of 1862 with Prussia was not renewed but France granted Germany, for trade and navigation, a most-favoured nation clause. France would respect the clauses of the Treaty of Frankfurt in their entirety until 1914. Citizenship Declarations In 1872, The German government told its new citizens that they must declare their choice to be either French, by the first of October, or German, by the same date of 1873. No declaration was necessary if one wanted to become German. If, however, one wanted to remain French, a declaration to that effect was to be made and they had to get out. Children were to have the same nationality as their parents chose. Those from the region who were overseas had to choose by October, 1873. Those who chose became known as the optants, the choosers.It resulted in mayhem with thousands of people boarding overcrowded trains to France. Many hoped to get around the law by leaving and then returning, crowding the trains going back. People were camping in the streets of Nancy. In Marseille, a charity was established to help pay the passage for any optants who wanted to emigrate to Algeria, where the colonial government gave them some of the best land. More than five thousand people took up the offer. In all, the total number of people in the region, in France, and worldwide who chose to remain French came to more than half a million. (http://french-genealogy.typepad.com/genealogie/2009/06/les-optants-of-alsacelorraine.html) Legacy This treaty polarized French policy towards Germany for the next forty years. The reconquest of Alsace-Lorraine, the lost provinces, became an obsession characterized by a revanchism which would be one of the most powerful motives in Frances involvement in War I.In 1918, U.S. President Wilson addressed the issue as Point 8 in his Fourteen_Points speech.Alsace-Lorraine returned to France under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles.

Devolution
Devolution is the statutory granting of powers from the government of a state to government at a subnational level, such as a regional, local, or state level. Devolution can be mainly financial, e.g. giving areas a budget which was formerly administered by central government. However, the power to make legislation relevant to the area may also be granted.Devolution differs from federalism in that the devolved powers of the subnational authority may be temporary and ultimately reside in central government, thus the state remains, jure unitary. Legislation creating devolved parliaments or assemblies can be repealed or amended by central government in the same way as any statute.systems, or federacies, differ in that state or provincial government is guaranteed in the constitution. Australia, Canada, India, Mexico and the States have federal systems, and have constitutions (as do some of their constituent states or provinces). They also have territories, with less power and authority than a state or province.AustraliaThe Capital Territory or Canberra refused self-government in a 1978 referendum, but was given limited self-government by a House of Assembly from 1979, and a Legislative Assembly with wider powers in 1988.The Territory of Australia refused statehood in a 1998 referendum. The rejection was a surprise to both the Australian and Northern Territory governments. The Northern Territory has its own parliament and Chief Minister, but any Territory legislation can be disallowed by the Commonwealth Parliament in Canberra, with one notable example being the NTs short lived euthanasia legislation.CanadaAlthough Canada is a federal state, a large portion of its land mass in the North is under the legislative jurisdiction of the federal government. This has been the case since 1870. In 1870, the Ruperts Land and North-Western Territory Order effected the admission of Ruperts Land and the North-Western Territory to Canada, pursuant to section 146 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and the Ruperts Land Act, 1868. The Manitoba Act, 1870, which created Manitoba out of part of Ruperts Land, also designated the remaining territories the Northwest Territories (NWT), over which Parliament was to exercise full legislative authority under the Constitution Act, 1871.Since the 1970s, the federal government has been transferring its decision-making powers to northern governments. This means greater local control and accountability by northerners for decisions central to the future of the territories. Yukon was carved from the Northwest Territories in 1898 but it remained a federal territory. Subsequently, in 1905, the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created from the Territories. Other portions of Ruperts Land were added to the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, taking the provinces from a narrow band around the St. Lawrence and lower Great Lakes northward. District of Ungava was a regional administrative district of Canadas Northwest Territories from 1895 to 1912. The continental areas of the District of Ungava were transferred by the Parliament of Canada with the adoption of the Quebec Boundary Extension Act, 1898 and the Quebec Boundaries Extension Act, 1912. The interior of Labrador which was believed part of Ungava was settled in 1927 by the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which ruled in favour of Newfoundland.(of Ungava)In 1999, the federal government created Nunavut pursuant to a land claim agreement reached with Inuit, the indigenous people of Canadas Eastern Arctic. The offshore islands to the west and north of Quebec remained part of the Northwest Territories until the creation of Nunavut in 1999.Since that time, the federal government has slowly devolved legislative jurisdiction to the territories. Enabling the territories to become more self-sufficient and prosperous and to play a stronger role in the Canadian federation is considered a key component to development in Canadas North. Among the three territories, devolution is most advanced in Yukon.Northwest TerritoriesThe Territories were governed from Ottawa from 1870 until the 1970s, except for the brief period between 1898 and 1905 when it was governed by an elected assembly. The Carruthers Commission was established in April 1963 by the government of B. Pearson. The three-man membership was appointed in 1965. It conducted surveys of opinion in the NWT in 1965 and 1966 and reported in 1966. Major recommendations included that the seat of government of the territories should be located in the territories. Yellowknife was selected as the territorial capital as a result. Transfer of many responsibilities from the federal government to that of the territories was recommended and carried out. This included responsibility for education, small business, public works, social services and local government. Since the report, the transfer of the Government of Northwest Territories has taken over responsibilities for several other programs and services including the delivery of health care, administration of airports and forestry management. The legislative jurisdiction of the territorial legislature is set out in section 16 of the Northwest Territories Act.In the past 30 years, the transfer of responsibilities to the Government of Northwest Territories has taken place for several programs and services including the delivery of health care, social services, education, administration of airports and forestry management.Now, the Government of Canada is negotiating the transfer of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Developments remaining provincial-type responsibilities in the NWT. These include the legislative powers, programs and responsibilities for land and resources associated with the departments Northern Affairs Program (NAP) with respect to:* powers to develop, conserve, manage and regulate of surface and subsurface natural resources in the NWT for mining and minerals (including oil and gas) administration, water management, land management and environmental management;* powers to control and administer public land with the right to use, sell or otherwise dispose of such land; and* powers to levy and collect resource royalties and other revenues from natural resources.The Government of the Northwest Territories, the Aboriginal Summit and the Government of Canada have each appointed a Chief Negotiator to work on devolution. A Framework Agreement was concluded in 2004. The target date for the completion of devolution talks for the NWT was March 2007. However, stumbling blocks associated with the transfer of current federal employees to the territorial government, and the unresolved issue of how much money the Northwest Territories will receive for its resources has delayed the conclusion of a devolution agreement for the NWT.NunavutIn 1966, the federal government established the Carrothers Commission to look at the issue of government in the North. After extensive study and consultation, the Commission concluded that division of the NWT was probably both advisable and inevitable. There was a recognition that Northerners wanted to run their own affairs and must be given the opportunity to do so. At the same time, however, it noted that governmental reform was required before this could happen. It recommended the establishment of a new system of representative government. As a result, in the late 1960s and in the 1970s, the federal government gradually created electoral constituencies and transferred many federally run programs to the territorial government. Northerners took on more and more responsibility for the day-to-day running of their own affairs.In 1982, a plebiscite was held in the NWT asking the question, Do you think the NWT should be divided? Fifty-three percent of eligible voters participated in the plebiscite, with 56.4 percent of them voting yes. Voter turnout and support for division was particularly strong in the Eastern Arctic. The Inuit population of the eastern section of the territory had become increasingly receptive of the idea of self-government. It was viewed as the best way to promote and protect their culture and traditions and address their unique regional concerns.Both the NWT Legislative Assembly and the federal government accepted the idea of dividing the territory. The idea was viewed as an important step towards enabling the Inuit, and other residents of the Eastern Arctic, to take charge of their own destiny. There were some reservations, however. Before action could be taken, certain practical considerations had to be addressed. First of all, outstanding land claims had to be settled. Second, all parties had to agree on a new boundary. Finally, all parties had to agree on the division of powers between territorial, regional and local levels of government. The various governments and native groups worked closely together to realize these goals.The Land Claims Agreement was ratified by the Inuit in November 1992, signed by the Prime Minister of Canada on May 25, 1993, and passed by the Canadian Parliament in June of the same year. It was the largest native land claim settlement in Canadian history. It gave the Inuit title over 350,000 square kilometres of land. It also gave the Inuit capital transfers from the federal government of over $1.1 billion over the next 14 years. This money will be held in trust with the interest to be used in a variety of different projects, including financing for regional businesses and scholarships for students. The Inuit also gained a share of resource royalties, hunting rights and a greater role in managing the land and protecting the environment. The land claims agreement also committed the Government of Canada to recommend to Parliament legislation to create a new territory in the eastern part of the Northwest Territories.While negotiations on a land claims settlement progressed, work was also taking place to determine potential jurisdictional boundaries for a new Eastern Territory. A proposal was presented to all NWT voters in a May 1992 plebiscite. Of those voting, 54 percent supported the proposed boundary. The Government of the Northwest Territories, the Tungavik Federation of Nunavut (the Inuit claims organization) and the federal government formally adopted the boundary for division in the Nunavut Political Accord.The final piece of the equation fit into place on June 10, 1993, when the Nunavut Act received Royal Assent. It officially established the territory of Nunavut and provided a legal framework for its government. It fixed April 1, 1999, as the day on which the new territory would come into existence.The Government of Nunavut is currently negotiating with the Government of Canada on a devolution agreement. Tunngavik, the organization of Inuit of Nunavut, is also a participant to negotiations to ensure that Inuit interests are represented.Devolution over natural resources to the Government of Nunavut moved forward with the appointment of a Ministerial Representative for Nunavut Devolution. The Representative has held meetings with interested parties including the Boards established under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA), territorial and federal government departments in order to determine if devolution will occur and if so the future mandate of devolution. The Government of Nunavut and Nunavut Tunngavik have appointed negotiators.YukonIn 1896 gold was discovered in the Yukon beginning of what is often considered the worlds greatest gold rush which saw the population of the Yukon grow rapidly. Indeed, by 1898, Dawson grew into the largest Canadian city west of Winnipeg, with a population of 40,000. In response, the Canadian government officially established the Yukon Territory in 1898. The West Mounted Police were sent in to ensure Canadian jurisdiction and The Yukon Act provided for a commissioner to administer the territory. The 1898 statute granted the Commissioner in Council the same powers to make ordinances... as are possessed by the Lieutenant Governor of the North-west Territories, acting by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly thereof. In 1908, amendments to the Yukon Act transformed the Council into an elected body.Over time the territorial government exercised expanded functions. Relevant developments include the following:By the mid-1960s, schools, public works, welfare and various other matters of a local nature had come under territorial administration.Increased authority of elected Council members over the ensuing period contributed to significant changes in the Yukon Commissioners role. In 1979, instructions from the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (Minister) directed the Commissioner to allow elected members and the Executive Council to make important policy decisions, specifying that his actions should normally be based on the advice and taken with the consent of the elected Executive Council.Like in the Northwest Territories, federal responsibilities were transferred to the Yukon government in the 1980s. In 1988, the Minister and the Yukon Government Leader signed a of Understanding committing the parties to smooth the progress of devolution of remaining province-like responsibilities to the Yukon Government. Responsibilities transferred since then include fisheries, mine safety, intra-territorial roads, hospitals and community health care, oil and gas and, most recently, natural resources.Discussion to transfer land and resource management responsibilities to the Yukon Government began in 1996, followed by a formal federal devolution proposal to the Yukon Government in January, 1997. In September 1998, a Devolution Protocol Accord to guide devolution negotiations was signed. On August 28, 2001 a final draft of the Devolution Transfer Agreement was completed for consideration. The Yukon Devolution transfer Agreement was concluded on October 29, 2001 with the Government of the Yukon enabling the transfer of remaining province-like responsibilities for land, water and resource management to the Government of the Yukon on April 1, 2003.MexicoThe Federal DistrictAll constituent states of Mexico are fully autonomous and comprise a federation. However, the Federal District, originally integrated by City and other municipalities, was created in 1824 to be the capital of the federation. As such, it was governed directly by the central or federal government and the of Mexico appointed its governor or executive regent. Even though the municipalities within the Federal District were autonomous, their powers were limited. In 1928, these municipalities were abolished and transformed into non-autonomous delegaciones or boroughs and a Central Department, later renamed as Mexico City. In 1970 this department was split into four new delegaciones, and Mexico City was constitutionally defined to be synonymous and coterminous with the entire Federal District.(Article 44, Political Constitution of the United Mexican States, Second Title, Second Chapter, 44rd article) (As such, the boroughs of the Federal District are boroughs of Mexico City).In the 1980s, the citizens of the Federal District, being the most populated federal entity in Mexico, began to demand for home rule; a devolution of autonomy in order to directly elect their head of government and to set up a Legislative Assembly. In 1987, an Assembly of Representatives was created, by constitutional decree, whose members were elected by popular vote.  The devolution of the executive power was not granted until 1997 when the first head government was elected by popular vote. Finally, in 2000, power was devolved to the delegaciones, though limited: residents can now elect their own heads of borough government (jefes delegacionales, in Spanish), but the delegaciones do not have regulatory powers and are not constituted by a board of trustees, like the municipalities of the constituent states.The autonomy, or home rule, of the Federal District, was granted by the federal government, which in principle, has the right to remove it. The president of Mexico still holds the final word in some decisions (e.g. he must approve some posts), and the Congress of the Union reviews the budget of the Federal District and sets the limit to its debt.(Cdigo Financiero del Distrito Federal)Some left-wing groups and political parties have advocated, since the 1980s, for a full devolution of powers by transforming the Federal District into the thirty-second constituent state of the Federation (with the proposed name of State of the Valley of Mexico, to be distinguished from the of Mxico. Another proposed name is State of the Anahuac).Indigenous peoplesIn a recent amendment to the of Mexico, the country was defined as a pluricultural nation originally founded upon the indigenous peoples.(Second Article of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States) They are granted free-determination to choose the social, economical, cultural and political organization for which they are to elect representatives democratically in whatever manner they see fit, traditionally or otherwise, as long as women have the same opportunities to participate in their social and political life. There are, however, no prescribed limits to their territories, and they are still under the jurisdiction of the municipalities and states in which they are located; the indigenous peoples can elect representatives before the municipal councils. In practice, they are allowed to have an autonomous form of self-government, but they are still subject to the rights and responsibilities set forth by the federal constitution and the constitution of the states in which they are located.United KingdomIn the Kingdom, devolved government was created following simple majority referenda in Wales and Scotland in September 1997. In 1998, the Parliament, Assembly for Wales and Ireland Assembly were established by law. England was left un-devolved.United StatesDistrict of ColumbiaIn the United States, the of Columbia offers an illustration of devolved government. The District is separate from any state, and has its own elected government; in many ways, on a day-to-day basis, it operates much like another state, with its own laws, court system, Department of Motor Vehicles, public university, and so on. However, the governments of the 50 states have a broad range of powers reserved to them by the U.S. Constitution, and most of their laws cannot be voided by any act of U.S. federal government. The District of Columbia, by contrast, is constitutionally under the sole control of the States Congress, which created the current District government by statute. Any law passed by the District legislature can be nullified by Congressional action, and indeed the District government could be significantly altered or eliminated entirely by a simple majority vote in Congress.The statesIn the United States only the federal government, state governments, and federally recognized American Indian tribal nations are recognized by the United States Constitution, so local governments are subdivisions of states. Theoretically, a state could abolish all local governments within its borders.Local governments such as municipalities, counties, parishes, boroughs, districts, and other types of local government and subdivision entities are devolved. They are established, regulated, and subject to governance by the constitutions or laws of the state in which they reside. Many local governments are given some degree of home rule, depending on the state. state legislatures, in most cases, have the power to change laws that affect local government structures. In some states, the governor may also have power over local government affairs.Hall Indian Casino, Idaho, USA.Gambling is allowed within Native American reservation lands.Movements calling for devolutionMovements calling for devolution also exist, to a more limited degree, in England.  The for an English Parliament (CEP) was formed in 1998 as a direct consequence of Scotland and Wales being given devolution referenda and England being left out. The CEP is largely responsible for putting devolution on the political and social agenda. There is a regional devolution movement in Cornwall and Yorkshire as well as some unofficial or historic English Regions such as Wessex and Mercia although these groups command very little support and are very much on the fringe of local politicsIn Italy, there is a political movement led by the Nord, for the home rule of Padania. In France, there are groups calling for devolution or full independence for Occitania, the Basque Country, Alsace, and Brittany.List of unitary states with devolutionOther meanings of the term devolutionIn some hierarchical churches, especially Anglican churches including the of England, devolution is a bishops appointment of a person to a benefice (e.g. a parish) when the ordinary patron or collator (i.e. the person or body with the right to appoint) has failed to do so, either because an improper candidate has been nominated or because no candidate could be foundCardinal Luciani, also known as Pope John Paul I, was the author of initiatives such as the devolution of one per cent of each churchs entries for the poor churches in the Developing World.Under United States estate tax provision, devolution may occur when a deceased obtains incidents of ownership under the Estate Tax Regulation 20.2042-1(c)2 in a fiduciary capacity from an independent transaction creating a trust for benefit of another party.

File:ancientlibraryalex.jpg|thumb|262px| The Library of Alexandria, an early form of information storage and retrieval.Information science is an interdisciplinary science primarily concerned with the analysis, collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval and dissemination of information.(Merriam-Webster and American Heritage Dictionary.) Practitioners within the field study the application and usage of knowledge in organizations, along with the interaction between people, organizations and any existing systems, with the aim of creating, replacing, improving or understanding information systems. Information science is often (mistakenly) considered a branch of science.  However, it is actually a broad, interdisciplinary field, incorporating not only aspects of computer science, but often diverse fields such as science, science, commerce, communications, law, science, museology, management, mathematics, philosophy, public policy, and the sciences.Information science focuses on understanding problems from the perspective of the stakeholders involved and then applying information and other technologies as needed. In other words, it tackles systemic problems first rather than individual pieces of technology within that system. In this respect, information science can be seen as a response to determinism, the belief that technology develops by its own laws, that it realizes its own potential, limited only by the material resources available, and must therefore be regarded as an autonomous system controlling and ultimately permeating all other subsystems of society.(Web Dictionary of Cybernetics and Systems) Within information science, attention has been given in recent years to interaction, groupware, the web, value sensitive design, design processes and to the ways people generate, use and find information. Today this field is called the Field of Information, and there are a growing number of Schools and Colleges of Information.Information science should not be confused with theory, the study of a particular mathematical concept of information, or with science, a field related to libraries which uses some of the principles of information science.Definitions of information scienceInformation Science consists of having the knowledge and understanding on how to collect, classify, manipulate, store, retrieve and disseminate any type of information.Some authors treat informatics as a synonym for information science, especially related to the concept developed by A. I. Mikhailov and other Soviet authors in the mid sixties, which suggested that informatics is a discipline related to the study of Scientific Information.(Mikhailov, A.I., Chernyl, A.I., and Gilyarevskii, R.S. (1966) Informatika  novoe nazvanie teorii naunoj informacii. Nauno tehnieskaja informacija, 12, pp. 3539.)Because of the rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary nature of informatics, a precise meaning of the term informatics is presently difficult to pin down.Regional differences and international terminology complicate the problem. Some people note that much of what is called Informatics today was once called Information Science at least in fields such as Medical Informatics. For example, when library scientists began also to use the phrase Information Science to refer to their work, the term informatics emerged:* in the United States as a response by computer scientists to distinguish their work from that of library science, and* in Britain as a term for a science of information that studies natural, as well as artificial or engineered, information-processing systems.HistoryEarly beginningsFile:Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz.jpg|thumb|150px|Wilhelm von Leibniz, a German polymath who wrote primarily in Latin and French. His fields of study were Metaphysics, Mathematics, Theodicy.Information science, in studying the collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval and dissemination of information has origins in the common stock of human knowledge. Information analysis has been carried out by scholars at least as early as the time of the Empire with the emergence of cultural depositories, what is today known as libraries and archives.(Clark, John Willis. The Care Of Books: An Essay On The Development Of Libraries And Their Fittings, From The Earliest Times To The End Of The Eighteenth Century. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1901) Institutionally, information science emerged in the 19th century along with many other social science disciplines. As a science, however, it finds its institutional roots in the of science, beginning with publication of the first issues of Transactions, generally considered the first scientific journal, in 1665 by the Royal Society (London).The institutionalization of science occurred throughout the 18th Century. In 1731, Franklin established the Company of Philadelphia, the first library owned by a group of public citizens, which quickly expanded beyond the realm of books and became a center of scientific experiment, and which hosted public exhibitions of scientific experiments.(Korty, Margaret Barton. Benjamin Franklin and Eighteenth Century American Libraries. Transactions of the American Philosophical Society December vol. 55.9 (1965)) Benjamin Franklin did invest a town in Massachusetts with a collection of books that the town voted to make available to all free of charge, which formed the first Public Library.() Academie de Chirurgia (Paris) published Memoires pour les Chirurgiens, generally considered to be the first medical journal, in 1736. The Philosophical Society, patterned on the Society (London), was founded in Philadelphia in 1743. As numerous other scientific journals and societies are founded, Alois Senefelder develops the concept of lithography for use in mass printing work in Germany in 1796.19th centuryFile:Joseph Marie Jacquard.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Marie JacquardBy the 19th Century the first signs of information science emerged as separate and distinct from other sciences and social sciences but in conjunction with communication and computation. In 1801, Marie Jacquard invented a punched card system to control operations of the cloth weaving loom in France. It was the first use of memory storage of patterns system.(Reichman, F. (1961). Notched Cards. In R. Shaw (Ed.), The state of the library art (Volume 4, Part 1, pp. 1155). New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers, The State University, Graduate School of Library Service) As chemistry journals emerged throughout the 1820s and 1830s,(Emard, J. P. (1976). An information science chronology in perspective. Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science , 2(8), 5156) Babbage developed his difference engine, the first step towards the modern computer, in 1822 and his analytical engine by 1834. By 1843 Hoe developed the rotary press, and in 1844 Morse sent the first public telegraph message. By 1848 William F. Poole begins the Index to Periodical Literature, the first general periodical literature index in the US.In 1854 Boole published An Investigation into Laws of Thought..., which lays the foundations for Boolean algebra, which is later used in retrieval.(Smith, E. S. (1993). On the shoulders of giants: From Boole to Shannon to Taube: The origins and development of computerized information from the mid-19th century to the present. Information Technology and Libraries , 12(2), 217226) In 1860 a congress is held at Karlsruhe Technische Hochschule to discuss the feasibility of establishing a systematic and rational nomenclature for chemistry. The congress does not reach any conclusive results, but several key participants return home with Stanislao Cannizzaros outline (1858), which ultimately convinces them of the validity of his scheme for calculating atomic weights.(Skolnik, H. (1976). Milestones in chemical information science: Award symposium on contributions of the Division of Chemical Literature (Information) to the Chemical Society. Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science , 16(4), 187193)By 1865 the Institution began a catalog of current scientific papers, which became the International Catalogue of Scientific Papers in 1902.(Adkinson, B. W. (1976). Federal governments support of information activities: A historical sketch. Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science, 2(8), 2426) The following year the Royal Society began publication of its Catalogue of Papers in London. In 1868, Christopher Sholes, Carlos Glidden, and S. W. Soule produced the first practical typewriter. By 1872 Lord Kelvin devised an analogue computer to predict the tides, and by 1875 Stephen Baldwin was granted the first US patent for a practical calculating machine that performs four arithmetic functions.( Graham Bell and Edison invented the telephone and phonograph in 1876 and 1877 respectively, and the Library Association was founded in Philadelphia. In 1879 Index Medicus was first issued by the Library of the Surgeon General, U.S. Army, with Shaw Billings as librarian, and later the library issues Index Catalogue, which achieved an international reputation as the most complete catalog of medical literature.(Schullian, D. M., & Rogers, F. B. (1958). The National Library of Medicine. I. Library Quarterly, 28(1), 117)European documentationThe discipline of European Documentation, which marks the earliest theoretical foundations of modern information science, emerged in the late part of the 19th Century together with several more scientific indexes whose purpose was to organize scholarly literature. Most information science historians cite Otlet and La Fontaine as the fathers of information science with the founding of the International Institute of Bibliography (IIB) in 1895.(Rayward, W. B. (1994). International federation for information and documentation. In W. A. Wiegand, & D. G. David Jr. (Eds.), The encyclopedia of library history (pp. 290294). New York: Garland Publishing, Inc.) A second generation of European Documentalists emerged after the World War, most notably Briet. However, information science as a term is not popularly used in academia until sometime in the latter part of the 20th Century.(Day, Ronald. Modern Invention of Information. Carbondale, Il.: Southern Illinois University Press, 2001: 7)Documentalists emphasized the utilitarian integration of technology and technique toward specific social goals. According to Ronald Day, As an organized system of techniques and technologies, documentation was understood as a player in the historical development of global organization in modernity  indeed, a major player inasmuch as that organization was dependent on the organization and transmission of information.(Day, Ronald. Modern Invention of Information. Carbondale, Il.: Southern Illinois University Press, 2001: 7)Otlet and Lafontaine (who won the Prize in 1913) not only envisioned later technical innovations but also projected a global vision for information and technologies that speaks directly to postwar visions of a global information society. Otlet and Lafontaine established numerous organizations dedicated to standardization, bibliography, international associations, and consequently, international cooperation. These organizations were fundamental for ensuring international production in commerce, information, communication and modern economic development, and they later found their global form in such institutions as the of Nations and the Nations. Otlet designed the Decimal Classification, based on Deweys decimal classification system.(Day, Ronald. Modern Invention of Information. Carbondale, Il.: Southern Illinois University Press, 2001:)Although he lived decades before computers and networks emerged, what he discussed prefigured what ultimately became the Wide Web. His vision of a great network of knowledge focused on documents and included the notions of hyperlinks, search engines, remote access, and networks.Otlet not only imagined that all the worlds knowledge should be interlinked and made available remotely to anyone, but he also proceeded to build a structured document collection. This collection involved standardized paper sheets and cards filed in custom-designed cabinets according to a hierarchical index (which culled information worldwide from diverse sources) and a commercial information retrieval service (which answered written requests by copying relevant information from index cards). Users of this service were even warned if their query was likely to produce more than 50 results per search.(By 1937 documentation had formally been institutionalized, as evidenced by the founding of the American Documentation Institute (ADI), later called the Society for Information Science and Technology.Transition to modern information scienceFile:Vannevar Bush portrait.jpg|thumb|250px|Bush, a famous information scientist, ca. 19401944With the 1950s came increasing awareness of the potential of automatic devices for literature searching and information storage and retrieval. As these concepts grew in magnitude and potential, so did the variety of information science interests. By the 1960s and 70s, there was a move from batch processing to online modes, from mainframe to mini and microcomputers. Additionally, traditional boundaries among disciplines began to fade and many information science scholars joined with library programs. They further made themselves multidisciplinary by incorporating disciplines in the sciences, humanities and social sciences, as well as other professional programs, such as law and medicine in their curriculum. By the 1980s, large databases, such as Med at the National Library of Medicine, and user-oriented services such as Dialog and Compuserve, were for the first time accessible by individuals from their personal computers. The 1980s also saw the emergence of numerous interest groups to respond to the changes. By the end of the decade, special interest groups were available involving non-print media, social sciences, energy and the environment, and community information systems. Today, information science largely examines technical bases, social consequences, and theoretical understanding of online databases, widespread use of databases in government, industry, and education, and the development of the Internet and World Wide Web.()Important historical figures*Berners-Lee*Shaw Billings*Boole*Briet*Buckland*Bush*Dewey*Floridi*La Fontaine*Kilgour*Leibniz*Ivanovich Mikhailov*R.

Some of them are:*science*studies*science*(field)*Informatics*management*systems research*literacy*science*studies*management*science*studies*management*ScientometricsTopics in information scienceBibliometricsBibliometrics is a set of quantitative methods used to study or measure texts and information and is one of the largest research areas within information science.Bibliometric methods include the journal Factor, a relatively crude but useful method of estimating the impact of the research published within a journal, in comparison to other journals in the same field. Bibliometrics is often used to evaluate or compare the impact of groups of researchers within a field. In addition it is also used to describe the development of fields, particularly new areas of research.Data modelingmodeling is the process of creating a model by applying a data model theory to create a data model instance. A data model theory is a formal data model description. See model for a list of current data model theories.Data modeling is structuring and organizing data. These data structures are then typically implemented in a management system. In addition to defining and organizing the data, data modeling will impose (implicitly or explicitly) constraints or limitations on the data placed within the structure.Managing large quantities of structured and unstructured data is a primary function of information systems. Data models describe structured data for storage in data management systems such as relational databases. They typically do not describe unstructured data, such as word processing documents, email messages, pictures, digital audio, and video.Document managementmanagement and engineering is a system (or set of computer programs) used to track and store documents and/or images of paper documents. management systems have some overlap with Content Management Systems, content management systems, Asset Management, imaging, Workflow systems and Management systems.GroupwareGroupware is software designed to help people get involved in a common task to achieve their goals. Collaborative software is the basis for supported cooperative work.Such software systems as email, calendaring, chat, wiki belong in this category. It has been suggested that law  the more people who use something, the more valuable it becomes  applies to such software.The more general term software applies to systems used outside the workplace, for example, dating services and networks like Friendster. The study of collaboration includes the study of this software and social phenomena associated with it.Human-computer interactioninteraction (HCI), alternatively man-machine interaction (MMI) or machine interface (HMI) or computerhuman interaction (CHI), is the study of interaction between people (users) and computers. It is an interdisciplinary subject, relating science with many other fields of study and research. Interaction between users and computers occurs at the interface (or simply interface), which includes both software and hardware, for example, general purpose computer peripherals and large-scale mechanical systems such as aircraft and power plants.Information architecturearchitecture is the practice of structuring information (knowledge or data) for a purpose. These are often structured according to their context in user interactions or larger databases. While most commonly applied to Web development, the term also applies to other disciplines such as programming, writing and Architecture.The term information architecture describes a specialized skill set which relates to the management of information and employment of informational tools. It has a significant degree of association with the library sciences. Many schools now teach information architecture.An alternate definition of information architecture exists within the context of system design, in which information architecture refers to data modeling and the analysis and design of the information in the system, concentrating on entities and their interdependencies. Data modeling depends on abstraction; the data relationships are of more interest than the particulars of individual records, though cataloging possible values is a common technique. The usability of human-facing systems are paramount. The alternate definition is preferred by Professional Architects who take offense the their professional designation being watered down to mean design.Information ethicsethics is the field that investigates the ethical issues arising from the development and application of information technologies. It provides a critical framework for considering moral issues concerning informational privacy, moral agency (e.g. whether artificial agents may be moral), new environmental issues (especially how agents should one behave in the infosphere), problems arising from the life-cycle (creation, collection, recording, distribution, processing, etc.) of information (especially ownership and copyright, divide). Information Ethics is therefore strictly related to the fields of ethics (Floridi, 1999) and the of information.Dilemmas regarding the life of information are becoming increasingly important in a society that is defined as the society. Information transmission and literacy are essential concerns in establishing an ethical foundation that promotes fair, equitable, and responsible practices. Information ethics broadly examines issues related to, among other things, ownership, access, privacy, security, and community.Information technology affects fundamental rights involving copyright protection, intellectual freedom, accountability, and security.Professional codes offer a basis for making ethical decisions and applying ethical solutions to situations involving information provision and use which reflect an organizations commitment to responsible information service. Evolving information formats and needs require continual reconsideration of ethical principles and how these codes are applied. Considerations regarding information ethics influence personal decisions, professional practice, and policy.Information retrievalretrieval (IR), often studied in conjunction with information storage, is the science of searching for information in documents, searching for documents themselves, searching for metadata which describe documents, or searching within databases, whether relational stand-alone databases or hypertextually networked databases such as the Wide Web. There is a common confusion, however, between data retrieval, retrieval, information retrieval, and retrieval, and each of these has its own bodies of literature, theory, praxis and technologies. IR is, like most nascent fields, interdisciplinary, based on science, mathematics, science, information science, psychology, linguistics, statistics and physics.Automated IR systems are used to reduce overload and to scale indexing and access. Many universities and public libraries use IR systems to provide access to books, journals, and other documents. IR systems are often related to digital objects and query. Queries are formal statements of information needs that are put to an IR system by the user. An object is an entity which keeps or stores information in a database. User queries are matched to objects stored in the database. A document is, therefore, a data object. Retrieval order is based on similarity of the query to the object and, more recently, to a level of importance of the document, such as PageRank. Sometimes the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates.Information societysociety is a society in which the creation, distribution, diffusion, use, and manipulation of information is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity. The economy is its economic counterpart whereby wealth is created through the economic exploitation of understanding.Specific to this kind of society is the central position information technology has for production, economy, and society at large. Information society is seen as the successor to society. Closely related concepts are the society (Bell), post-fordism, post-modern society, society, Telematic Society, Information Revolution, and society (Castells).Information systemsAn information system is a technologically implemented medium for recording, storing, and disseminating linguistic expressions, as well as for drawing conclusions from such expressions.The technology used for implementing information systems by no means has to be technology. A notebook in which one lists certain items of interest is, according to that definition, an information system. Likewise, there are computer applications that do not comply with this definition of information systems. systems are an example. A computer application that is integrated into clothing or even the human body does not generally deal with linguistic expressions. One could, however, try to generalize Langefors definition so as to cover more recent developments.Intellectual propertyproperty (IP) is a disputed term for various legal entitlements which attach to certain names, written and recorded media, and inventions. The holders of these legal entitlements are generally entitled to exercise various rights in relation to the subject matter of the IP. The term intellectual property links the idea that this subject matter is the product of the mind or the intellect together with the political and economical notion of property. The close linking of these two ideas is a matter of some controversy. It is criticised as a fad by Lemley of Law School and by Stallman of the Software Foundation as an overgeneralization and at best a catch-all to lump together disparate laws.()Intellectual property laws and enforcement vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. There are inter-governmental efforts to harmonise them through international treaties such as the 1994 Trade Organization (WTO) on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs), while other treaties may facilitate registration in more than one jurisdiction at a time. Enforcement of copyright, disagreements over medical and patents, and the dispute regarding the nature of intellectual property as a cohesive notion( have so far prevented the emergence of a cohesive international system.Knowledge managementmanagement comprises a range of practices used by organizations to identify, create, represent, and distribute knowledge for reuse, awareness, and learning across the organizations.Knowledge Management programs are typically tied to organizational objectives and are intended to lead to the achievement of specific outcomes, such as shared intelligence, improved performance, competitive advantage, or higher levels of innovation.transfer (one aspect of Knowledge Management) has always existed in one form or another. Examples include: on-the-job peer discussions, formal apprenticeship, corporate libraries, professional training, and mentoring programs. However, since the late twentieth century, additional technology has been applied to this task.Knowledge engineeringKnowledge engineering is also related to mathematical logic, as well as strongly involved in science and socio-cognitive engineering where the knowledge is produced by socio-cognitive aggregates (mainly humans) and is structured according to our understanding of how human reasoning and logic works. engineering (KE), often studied in conjunction with knowledge management, refers to the building, maintaining and development of systems. It has a great deal in common with engineering, and is related to many science domains such as intelligence, databases, mining, systems, support systems and information systems.Personal information managementinformation management (PIM) as a field of study covers many of the same areas as information science but approaches the study of information from the perspective of the whole person. How is information in various forms (paper documents, wikis, blogs, email, etc.) used by people in support of their efforts to understand and effect useful change in their world? How can tools of information management help?Semantic webWeb is an evolving extension of the Wide Web in which content can be expressed not only in language, but also in a form that can be understood, interpreted and used by agents, thus permitting them to find, share and integrate information more easily.() It derives from W3C director Berners-Lees vision of the Web as a universal medium for data, information, and knowledge exchange.At its core, the Semantic Web comprises a philosophy,() a set of design principles,() collaborative groups, and a variety of enabling technologies. Some elements of the Semantic Web are expressed as prospective future possibilities that have yet to be implemented or realized.() Other elements of the Semantic Web are expressed in formal specifications.() Some of these include Description Framework (RDF), a variety of data interchange formats (e.g. RDF/XML, N3, Turtle, and notations such as Schema (RDFS) and the Ontology Language (OWL). All of which are intended to formally describe concepts, terms, and relationships within a given problem domain.Usability engineeringengineering is a subset of factors that is specific to science and is concerned with the question of how to design software that is easy to use. It is closely related to the field of interaction and design. The term usability engineering (UE) (in contrast to other names of the discipline, like design or experience design) tends to describe a pragmatic approach to interface design which emphasizes empirical methods and operational definitions of user requirements for tools. Extending as far as Organisation for Standardisation-approved definitions usability is considered a context-dependent agreement of the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with which specific users should be able to perform tasks. Advocates of this approach engage in analysis, then prototype interface designs and conduct usability tests. On the basis of such tests, the technology is (ideally) re-designed or (occasionally) the operational targets for user performance are revised.User-centered designdesign is a philosophy and a process in which the needs, wants, and limitations of the end user of an interface or document are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process. User-centered design can be characterized as a multi-stage problem solving process that not only requires designers to analyze and foresee how users are likely to use an interface, but to test the validity of their assumptions with regards to user behaviour in real world tests with actual users. Such testing is necessary as it is often very difficult for the designers of an interface to understand intuitively what a first-time user of their design experiences, and what each users curve may look like.The chief difference from other interface design philosophies is that user-centered design tries to optimize the user interface around how people can, want, or need to work, rather than forcing the users to change how they work to accommodate the system or function.ResearchMany universities have entire colleges, departments or schools devoted to the study of information science, while numerous information science scholars can be found in disciplines such as communication, science, law, science, and sociology. Several institutions have formed an I-School Caucus (see of I-Schools), but there are numerous others with comprehensive information foci.Research methodsInformation science has similar methods to computer science and sciences:;research: Facts or factual evidences from a variety of records are compiled.;complexity and structure: Algorithmic and graphic methods are used to explore the complexity of information systems, retrieval and storage.;analysis: The contents of books and mass media are analyzed to study how people communicate and the messages people talk or write about.;study: A specific set of circumstances or a group (the case) is analyzed according to a specific goal of study. Generally, case studies are used to characterize a trend or development; they have weak generalizability.;analysis: Analyzing written, spoken or signed language use;method: This involves a continuous and systematic search for the information and knowledge about past events related to the life of a person, a group, society, or the world.;Interviews: The researcher obtains data by interviewing people. If the interview is non-structured, the researcher leaves it to the interviewee (also referred to as the respondent or the informant) to guide the conversation.;Life history: This is the study of the personal life of a person. Through a series of interviews, the researcher can probe into the decisive moments in their life or the various influences on their life.;study: This is an extensive examination of a specific group over a long period of time.;Observation: Using data from the senses, one records information about a social phenomenon or behavior. Qualitative research relies heavily on observation, although it is in a highly disciplined form.;observation: As the name implies, the researcher goes to the field (usually a community), lives with the people for some time, and participates in their activities in order to know and feel their culture.See also* modelling* Federation for Information Processing  Global body for informatics.* Methods Institute - Information science to empower researchers and analystsReferencesFurther reading* External links* Scientists Information* Knowledge Map of Information Science* Journal of Information Science* What Has Information Science Contributed to the World?* Digital Library of Information Science and Technology open access archive for the Information Sciences* Current Information Science Research at U.S. Geological Survey* Introduction to Information Science* The Nitecki Trilogy* Information science at the University of California at Berkeley in the 1960s: a memoir of student days* Chronology of Information Science and Technology* LIBRES - Library and Information Science Research Electronic Journal - Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Western Australiavdada:Informationsvidenskabde:Informationswissenschaftet:Infoteadusel:es:Documentacinde linformationinformasihe:lt:Informologijahu:Informcitudomnynl:Informatiekundeja:no:Informasjonsvitenskapda informaosk:Informatikasl:Informatikasv:Informationsvetenskapth:bilimihc thng tinzh:

Fairburn_Ings_RSPB_reserve
File:Fairburn Ings.jpg|thumb|right|Flotilla of Swans with Fairburn village on the horizonFairburn Ings RSPB reserve is a flagship RSPB reserve in the county of Yorkshire, England; established in 1968. It is managed by the Society for the Protection of Birds in conjunction with the local council. Situated in the Lower Aire Valley, and forming part of Fairburn & Newton Ings SSSI, RSPB Fairburn Ings is a Local Nature Reserve (LNR), with a focus mainly on wildfowl and waders, although many other birds can be seen.  It lies 1.5 miles (2.5 km) west of Fairburn, near Castleford. The word ing (from ings) is of Old Norse origin and means damp or marshy land, a reference to the area being flooded regularly by the Aire.Lying alongside the Aire, the 286 hectare site includes a large loch and a number of smaller water bodies; the area has been the scene of industrial and mining operations for 150 years, and all the water bodies are the result of subsidence of former coal-mine workings, up to half a kilometre underground, providing habitats for wildfowl and many other birds. The site is bordered by predominantly arable farmland to the north, and industrial and urban environments to the south and west. One third of the site has been developed from 26 million cubic metres of colliery spoil which have been landscaped to create a large complex of herb-rich grassland, wetland and woodland. Habitats include flood meadows, wet fenland, marsh and reedbed, woodland and scrub. The reserve has the highest number of species recorded at any site, at 274.UK Action Plan (UK BAP) habitats at Fairburn Ings: mesotrophic lakes, reedbed, lowland meadow.  BAP species of these habitats include: grey partridge (Perdix perdix), turtle dove (Streptopelia turtur), skylark (Alauda arvense), song thrush (Turdus philatelist), tree sparrow (Passer montanus), linnet (Carduelis cannabina), bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyorrhoea), reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus), corn bunting (Milaria calandra), water vole (Arvicola terrestris ) and pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus pippistrellus). Birds of conservation concern of these habitats include: the black-necked grebe (Podiceps nigrocollis), Garganey (Anas querquedula), redshank (Tringa totanus), whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus) and golden plover (Pluvialis apricalia).External links*Official site*UK Biodiversity Action Plan Website*Fairburn Ings on the VisitWoods website

This spring emerges from an abandoned mine shaft that has been dammed up.  Many area residents get water at this spring.Buchtel was mainly known as a coal mining community started by syndicate man John R. Buchtel who used his profits from the area to start Buchtel College, later became the University of Akron.  The coal was used to heat pig iron into iron ingots in large furnaces in the area and was very profitable until a better grade of iron was discovered at Lake Erie.  John helped to bring trains to the county, to ship out the iron and coal and to the large industrial cities.  He created a foundry at Nelsonville to make coal train cars to haul the coal to the north.The coal mine was called the old #8 coal mine for many years.  There is a city park currently on the spot of the old mine.  The coal mines in the area closed down when better grades of coal which contained less sulphur were discovered elsewhere.The Buchtel Catholic church is a city icon and has been in operation for over one hundred years.  Recent additions have made it a beautiful landmark.  Descendants of the original residents of Buchtel are still in attendance.  The descendants of the original settlers are of mainly Irish, German and Hungarian ancestry.

It is considered to be part of the Back. The city is  southeast of downtown Lake City and  from Salt Lake Citys east edge of Sugar House along Interstate 80. The population was 7,558 at the 2010 census. On average, the tourist population greatly exceeds the number of permanent residents.After a population decline following the shutdown of the areas mining industry, the city rebounded during the 1980s and 1990s through an expansion of its tourism business. The city currently brings in a yearly average of $529,800,000 to the Utah Economy as a tourist hot spot.(http://www.parkcityinfo.com/docs/TOURISM_2009.pdf) The city has three major resorts: City Mountain Resort, Valley Resort, and Canyons Resort. The Park City and Valley ski resorts were the major locations for ski and snowboarding events at the Winter Olympics. Although they receive less snow and have a shorter ski season than do their counterparts in Lake County, such as Snowbird resort, they are much easier to access.Additionally the city is the main location of the United States largest film festival, the Film Festival, home of the States Ski Team, training center for members of the Australian Freestyle Ski Team, the largest collection of outlet stores in northern Utah, the 2002 Olympic bobsled/skeleton/luge track at the Olympic Park, and golf courses. Some scenes from 1994s and Dumber were shot in the city. Outdoor-oriented businesses such as backcountry.com, Rossignol USA and Skullcandy have their headquarters in Park City.  The city has many upscale luxury retailers, clubs, bars, and restaurants, and has nearby reservoirs, springs, forests, and hiking and biking trails.  Park City is also the original home of the Mrs. Fields Cookies chain.In the summertime many valley residents of the Front visit the town to escape high temperatures. Park City is usually 20 F (11 C) cooler than Salt Lake City, as it lies mostly above  above level, while Salt Lake City is situated at an altitude of about . It is one of the wealthiest cities in the United States and is notable for having a large number of Northern and European immigrants. It is also generally thought to be the most liberal city in Utah, with supermajorities usually supporting Democratic Party candidates and issues.In 2008, Park City was named by Forbes Traveler Magazine among one of the 20 prettiest towns in the United States.(http://www.forbestraveler.com/best-lists/americas-prettiest-towns-story.html) It continues to be published in top ski and adventure magazines across the world. History The area was travelled by the early Mormon pioneers on their journey to where they settled and built Salt Lake City. One of their leaders, Parley P. Pratt, explored the canyon in 1848.  He was given a charter the following year to build a toll road through it, which was finished in 1849. (http://web.archive.org/web/20061010083523/http://utahrails.net/utahrails/parleys.php) The basin at the top of the canyon was good for grazing, and a few families settled there.  Early on, the area was deeded to Samuel Snyder, Heber C. Kimball and Jedediah Grant.  The settlers named it Parleys Park City, which was shortened to Park City in the early 1900s. The first known discovery of ore in this area was by Colonel Patrick E. Connor, who instigated his men to search the area in bringing non-Mormons to the Utah region.(historytogo.utah.gov) The finding of silver, gold and lead sparked the first silver mines in Park City in the 1860s.  Park Citys large mining boom brought large crowds of prospectors setting up camps around the mountain terrain, marking the first mining settlements. Although it was not the first find, the Ontario mine, discovered by Herman Buden in 1872 and later purchased by Hearst, was the first major producer. By 1892 the Silver King Mine and its owners Kearns and David Keith took the spotlight as one of the most famous silver mines in the world.((http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/whq/37.4/rugh.html) While silver was thriving in Utah, other mines across the world were depleted, drawing many of these miners to Park City. The town flourished with crowds of miners and wealth.  However, the city nearly became a ghost town by the end of the 1950s because of a drop in the price of silver, and the determent of World War I and the Great Depression.The transformation of the town into a ski resort is primarily attributed to the silver need during (and after) World War I economy. The war and Great Depression were creating strikes and crippling the economy.((Once the site of the largest silver-mining camp in the country, the town was virtually destroyed by fire in 1898. Tragedy struck again in 1902 when 34 miners were killed in an explosion in the Day West Mine. The mining community never fully recovered and the miners resorted to desperate measures. These desperate measures were based on the need to revive the economy, and in doing so the miners gave up their mining heritage, turning to the rising interest in the West and skiing. The silver industry was suffering severely, and the town was hanging by a thread when Parkite miners presented to Utahns Inc. a proposal for a ski resort called Treasure Mountain which ended up saving the town. This ski resort opened in 1963 on  of land the miners owned with mineral rights. This is said to be when tourists first largely began to visit Park City. This marks the beginning of the ski industry largely promoted by the Utah State Legislation as a destination resort.(Since the rise of the skiing and tourist economy, Park City houses more tourists than residents. It has become a place of fame through the 2002 Winter Olympic games and provides more attractions than ever before. In the 1950s, Utah began to feed on Park City as a mountain getaway, and not until D. James Canon promoted winter sports in Utah, with the promotional scheme of Ski Utah and The Greatest Snow on Earth( did many drive to see for themselves why Utah is a winter wonderland. Utah drew in over 648,000 tourists in 1970 and now a yearly average of 4 million tourists.(http://www.parkcityinfo.com/docs/TOURISM_2009.pdf) In a small town with a population of 8,000, the average number of tourists in Park City is 600,000 per year.  This significant increase in visitors is largely credited to promotional material that is carefully planned and distributed by the Utah Publicity and Tourist Council. Growth has accelerated in the last few decades, and Park City is now one of the most affluent and lively resort towns in the States.The tourist industry now contributes over one third of the total economic value to the state of Utah.(http://www.umich.edu/~econdev/parkcity/) In particular, Park City draws in 3,006,071 average annual visitors; in the winter 1,603,775, and in the summer 1,402,296. Park City prospers from the average nightly visitor spending ranging from $100 to $350.( Currently, Park City primarily relies on its tourist industry from skiing to restaurants to hiking and biking. The makeover of Park City has stimulated an entirely different culture of expenditure, adventure, and wealth, and their promotional material indulges it.As long ago as the 1920s, miners in Park City were using underground trains and shafts to gain access to the mountain for skiing. Aerial trams once used for hauling ore were converted into chairlifts. To this day, there are still more than  of old silver-mine workings and tunnels beneath the slopes at Park City Mountain Resort and neighboring Deer Valley. Park City might be a fairly nondescript-appearing town were it not for its colorful and evocative Main Street, where 64 Victorian buildings are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. There are many remaining mine buildings, mine shafts (most blocked off from outsiders with large steel doors), and hoists, including the weathered remains of the Walker Webster Silver Mine and the water towers once used to hydrate one of the biggest mines, the Silver King, provide a hint of the history of this mining town transformed in economic upheaval into a skiing resort. Location Park City is located at  (40.659306, -111.499828).According to the States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . None of the area is covered with water.Park City is located at the south end of Basin and climbs steep mountains to the southeast, south, and west. It is accessed by State Route 224 from Interstate 80 to the north and State Route 248(Kearns Boulevard), which heads east to U.S. Route 40 and on to Kamas.ClimateSummers in Park City are mild, with chilly nights - while winters are cold and very snowy. On average, the temperature exceeds  five times and drops below  twelve times per annum.() source 2Weatherbase(DemographicsAs of the census of 2010, there were 7,558 people, 2,885 households, and 1,742 families residing in the city.

Manchester_Bolton_&_Bury_Canal
nav          British WaterwaysThe Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal is a disused canal in Manchester, England, built to link Bolton and Bury with Manchester.  The canal, when fully opened, was 15 miles 1 furlong (24.3 km) long. It was accessed via a junction with the Irwell in Salford.  Seventeen locks were required to climb to the summit as it passed through Pendleton, heading northwest to Prestolee before it split northwest to Bolton and northeast to Bury.  Between Bolton and Bury the canal was on the same level and required no locks. Six aqueducts were built to allow the canal to cross the rivers Irwell and Tonge, as well as various minor roads.The canal was commissioned in 1791 by local landowners and businessmen and built between 1791 and 1808, during the Golden Age of canal building, at a cost of 127,700 (0 today).(Two Acts of Parliament allowed the company to raise 47,000, and 80,000 respectively)  Originally designed for narrow gauge boats, during its construction the canal was altered into a broad gauge canal to allow an ultimately unrealised connection with the and Liverpool Canal.  The canal company later converted into a railway company and built a railway line close to the canals path, which required modifications to the Salford arm of the canal.Most of the freight carried was coal from local collieries but, as the mines reached the end of their working lives sections of the canal fell into disuse and disrepair and it was officially abandoned in 1961.  In 1987 a society was formed with the aim of restoring the canal for leisure use and, in 2006, restoration began in the area around the junction with the River Irwell in Salford.  The canal is currently navigable as far as East Ordsall Lane, in Salford. History  Proposal The local geology of the Valley, which included steep sided valleys with fast flowing rivers subject to rapid flooding and dry seasons, meant that river transport in the area was confined to the and Irwell Navigation to the west of Manchester.  A combination of factors, including financial unrest and British involvement in the Revolutionary War, meant that transport investment in Manchester was restricted mainly to road improvements.()With the arrival of more favourable conditions, including the end of the war, a proposal for a canal to link the towns of Manchester, Bolton and Bury was mooted.  Matthew Fletcher had in 1789 been employed as a technical advisor and had surveyed the route of the proposed canal,() but the first public notice came from Manchester on 4 September 1790.()  The initial proposal probably came from a group in Bolton, with the support of the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company.()  A meeting was intended to be holden at the House of Mr Shawe, the Bulls Head in Manchester aforesaid, on Monday, the twentieth day of this instant, September, at eleven oclock in the forenoon, where Surveys, Plans, Levels, Estimates and Proposals would be presented.(()  A further meeting on 16 September, held in Bolton, appointed a committee of six Boltonians chaired by Lord Grey de Wilton to attend at Manchester.  A series of resolutions at this meeting followed a discussion of the route, and authorised the necessary actions to bring the plan into fruition, which included the petitioning of Parliament for the required bill.  Henshall was asked to survey the proposed route of the canal.(For local industries along the route of the proposed canal, whose operations relied on water from local rivers and brooks which the canal might also use, its construction was a controversial idea.  At a meeting in Bolton on 4 October 1790, it was resolved that proper clauses be inserted in the bill to prevent injury to owners of mills.(  A meeting in Bury at the Eagle & Child house on 29 September 1790 secured an agreement that the utility of this scheme nevertheless cannot with propriety be ascertained until such time as it has been certified, from whence and in what proportion the proprietors of the intended navigation expect to draw their resources of water.()  At another meeting in Bury, on 13 October 1790, Henshall gave a written report on the canal, and stated that his plan would not require water from the river in times of drought, but that floods and rivulets would supply his reservoirs.  He suggested that mill owners could be protected by a suitable clause in the bill, and such a clause was duly obtained by Robert Peel.()  Businesses in Bolton were concerned with the location of the canal terminus, and proposed the construction of a tunnel to allow the terminus to be built closer to the town centre.  Ralph Fletcher, spokesman for those concerned, reported on this proposal to the committee, although no tunnel was built.() Subscribers and funding In a document entitled A list of subscribers to the intended Bolton Bury and Manchester Canal Navigation, now kept in the Manchester County Record Office,() some of the more notable subscribers are listed,(Of this list, the Earl of Derby, John Heathcote, Lord Grey de Wilson, and Matthew Fletcher were the main owners of land northeast of Clifton.) along with the amounts invested by each.  Many of the 95 investments on the list appear to have been made by proxy.  The largest is 3,000, and the smallest 100.  The total sum of investments is 47,700.  5 per 100 share was initially paid, with an additional 10 call made by 10 August 1791.  Similar share calls were made at regular intervals over the following years.()  The first dividend of 4% was paid in July 1812, with regular payments following thereafter.() Work begins Following a parliamentary survey of the route by Charles McNiven,() the bill received Assent on 13 May 1791( and became an Act of Parliament for the construction of the canal, by which the proprietors were empowered to purchase land for a breadth of 26 yards on level ground, and wider where required for cuttings or embankments.()()  The Act allowed the company to raise 47,000, with shares of 100.()  The intention was that at Prestolee the route would divide into two branches (arms), with one branch towards Bolton and the other to Bury, but it would not, however, join the River Irwell.(  The proprietors were entitled to take water from any brooks within  of the canal, or within  of the canal summits at Bolton and Bury.(At a meeting in Manchester on 30 June 1791, at the house of Alexander Patten, a committee was formed with the following members:()# Lord Grey de Wilton, Heaton House, Lancashire# Sir John Edenson Heathcote, Longton, Newcastle, Staffordshire# Butterworth Bayley esq.  Hope, Salford( )# Robert Andrews esq  Rivington# James Wareing, Gentleman, Knowsley# Matthew Fletcher (Mine owner, Clifton)# Peter Wright, Gentleman, Manchester# William Marsden, Merchant, Manchester# Charles McNiven, Gentleman, Manchester# Hugh Henshall, Longpost, Staffordshire# John Pilkington, Merchant, ManchesterThe meeting secured a resolution that Matthew Fletcher and Mr McNiven shall dispatch or procure 100 wheelbarrows and as many planks as they shall think necessary for the use and accommodation of the canal navigation.  Further meetings took place from 2629 July.  Matthew Fletcher was ordered to meet with land owners to discuss the purchase of any land along the route of the canal, and with this in mind, on 30 July 1791 John Seddon of Sandy Lane was ordered to survey the line of the canal beginning within the estate of John Edenson Heathcote, and ending at the southern extremity of the Reverend Daunteseys estate.  Fletcher and Henshall were ordered to contact people and companies in the building trade to discuss construction.(At a meeting on 16 August 1791, several persons attended, and made offers for the contract to build the canal.  A Mr John Seddon of Little Hulton, a labourer, agreed to a contract on Matthew Fletchers terms, for a certain part of the canal.  Five other persons were rejected, their proposals not receiving the approbation of the committee.(With news of the planned Canal link into Manchester,(The construction of the Rochdale Canal did not reach Manchester until 1804.) the company proposed to extend the canal from Bury through Littleborough, and to connect with the Rochdale Canal at Sladen.  The new route, known as the Bury and Sladen Canal, was intended as a rival scheme to the proposed Rochdale link into Manchester.  A survey was also carried out on a proposed extension from Sladen to Bridge.()  The company also considered links to the and Liverpool Canal and the and Irwell Navigation.  These plans would have substantially increased the trans-Pennine traffic using the companys canal, and caused a potential loss of traffic and revenue on the nearby Canal.  With this in mind, the owner of the Bridgewater Canal, the Duke of Bridgewater, agreed to allow the Rochdale Canal Company to connect to his canal at Manchester.()  Despite the persistence of the canal company, the Rochdale Canal plan won the day and in 1797 the company abandoned the Bury and Sladen Canal plan.()thumb|left|upright|Map of the canal showing features and sections with/without water.After several years of construction, on 9 January 1794 an agreement was reached with the Leeds and Liverpool Canal company to create a link from the Bolton arm of the canal to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Red Moss, near Horwich.  This agreement required significant design changes to allow the canal to carry the wider boats used on the broad gauge Leeds and Liverpool Canal,( which included a change to broad locks.  Outram was employed to inspect the works, and reported on the cost of this conversion as being 26,924.()  Although the necessary changes were implemented, the route of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was altered and the link was not built.  In the same year the Canal link to the Leeds and Liverpool canal was proposed, from the Bury arm of the canal.()()  Although authorised by an Act of Parliament, it too was never built.  The canal company remained hopeful of a link between the two canals, but all hope of this was lost when on 21 June 1819 an Act of Parliament was enacted to create a link between the Leigh extension of the Canal, and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.()A report entitled A Statement of the Situation of the Works of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal, on the Eighteenth of December, 1795. gives details of the progress of the works, including details of bridges, cuttings, raised bankings and aqueducts.()  Much of the document details the work required to convert the canal to broad gauge.  A  length between Oldfield Lane in Salford and Giants Seat Locks in Outwood was navigable with 3 ft 8 in (1.12 m) of water.  The remaining work included strengthening work to the banks, an increase of water depth to , and the gravelling of half of the towpath.  Between Giants Seat locks and Ringley Bridge two locks had been erected, with a small section of canal to be broadened before becoming navigable.  From Ringley Bridge to Prestolee Aqueduct one lock had been erected.  Nob End Locks were still under construction but mostly complete, although the basin at the bottom had not yet been dug.  The stretch to Bolton had at this time been widened, with several bridges requiring further work, incomplete embankments, construction of a weir, and gravelling of the towpath.  On the Bury arm, almost the entire length had been dug, and walls to support the canal along the bank of the Irwell had been built.  Some widening of previously narrow sections had yet to be undertaken, none of the towpath had been gravelled, and no fences had been erected along the towpath.Significant parts of the canal were completed by 1796, including the stretch up to Bury in October of that year.(  With the completion of the Bolton arm in the following year,() much of the canal opened for business.  The connection to Canal was completed in 1800, but with the failure of the scheme to connect the Bolton arm of the canal to the and Liverpool Canal, the canal remained isolated from any other navigable waterway.  One proposed remedy involved the construction of an aqueduct over the River Irwell in Manchester, to connect directly to the Rochdale Canal between Castlefield and Piccadilly.()  A bill was proposed in 1799 but after strong objections from the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company( they eventually gave up and subsequently, over the following seven years, the canal company purchased enough land to build a canal link directly to the Irwell.During construction the company, having spent all of the money allowed in the 1791 Act of Parliament, incurred a debt of 31,345.  They therefore applied for a further Act(An Act to enable the Company of Proprietors of the Canal Navigation from Manchester to Bolton and to Bury, to raise money to complete the same) to raise more money.  This act, granted in 1805,() allowed them to raise an additional 80,000.  This allowed them to repay the debt, and continue work to finish the canal.()  An inspection in June 1808 reported that by November 1808 the canal would be complete throughout.()A connection to the Rochdale Canal was eventually built in 1839 via the and Salford Junction Canal, which was funded in part by the proprietors of the MB&B canal.() Traffic Most of the traffic along the canal transported coal from the many collieries that existed along its length, including Colliery and Colliery.  Some of these collieries were linked by road, and some were linked by short tramlines.()() In the late 19th century as much as  of coal and  of other materials( Retrieved on 2008-06-29) including soil() and fruit() were transported annually.  The canal also allowed the transport of salt from Cheshire to the many bleach and dye works in the area  hence the name of Salt Wharf on the Bolton arm of the canal. Tolls were easily calculated as milestones were placed at 1/4-mile (400 m) intervals along the towpath.  This was important as journeys were often quite short, the collieries being so close to industry along the canals length.()Image:Ladyshore Waterson.JPG|right|thumb|Colliery in 1968The boats used to transport coal were short and narrow, and each contained a row of boxes used for carrying coal.  Each box had a base of two halves, hinged and held closed with chains.  These boxes would be lifted out of the boats, positioned by crane over a bunker or cart and emptied by releasing the chains on the base.  This design helped keep the canal competitive, as it increased the speed with which loading and unloading of the boats could be performed.()The canal would often freeze in winter, so an icebreaker was used to ensure the canal remained navigable during the cold weather.  Named Sarah Lansdale() and owned by James Crompton Paperworks, it was towed by a team of horses while the crew stood astride the deck, secured to the handrails, rocking the boat from side to side and breaking the ice in the process.  Often, ice would be encountered that was so thick the boat would rise up onto the surface of the ice.()  This boat did once reside at the boat museum in Port Dock( but was later destroyed by fire.Food and drink was made available to those using the canal in several places including Margaret Barlows Tea Gardens, Kilcoby Cottage, and Rhodes Lock.  A camping ground was also available at Kilcoby Cottage.()  The nearby Giants Seat House was for some time the home of the canal manager.()The canal also carried packet services, with passengers facing a three-hour journey between Bolton and Manchester.()  The first passenger boat to Bolton was launched in 1796 from the Windsor Castle public house, and in 1798 a new packet boat was built for the use of the company.(()  Fares were initially fixed by the canal company (although from 1805 contracted-out) and based upon the service required; a passenger using the state cabin from Bolton to Manchester would be charged one shilling six pence, and a single shilling on the return journey.(  Passengers would change boats at Prestolee to avoid delays at the lock flight and also to save water,( and a purpose-built covered walkway the length of the road was constructed for their benefit.()()() Another passenger service ran along the two arms from Bolton to Bury, and over 60,000 passengers per year travelled on the canal; between July 1833 and June 1834, 21,060 made the journey from Bolton to Manchester, 21,212 people travelled from Manchester to Bolton, and 20,818 intermediary passengers hopped on and off the boats en route.()  In 1834 the Bolton to Manchester service earned 1,177 and the Bolton to Bury service earned 75.(  The service was quite luxurious compared to some packet boat services: central heating was provided in winter and drinks were served on board.  This caused a tragedy in 1818, however, when a party of twenty drunken passengers managed to capsize the boat and a number of passengers, including two children, were drowned.((Several fatal incidents combined with general passenger concern caused the canal company to improve passenger safety; in 1802 a wall was built at the wharf at Oldfield Lane in Salford and in 1833 a gas lamp was installed at Ringley Wharf.(A parcel service was also offered, although this proved unpopular as it was unreliable.() Railway proposal right|thumb|The seal of the Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal Navigation & Railway CompanyIn March 1829 the idea of building a branch railway line from the Oldfield Road terminus in Salford to the new and Manchester Railway was mooted, but nothing was built.  In 1830 the canal company, led by chairman Sir John Tobin, began to promote a proposal to build a railway along the line of the canal, from Salford to Bolton.  Alexander Nimmo was employed to report on the proposal and told that it was possible so far as he expressed himself capable of judging from his present cursory view of the canal.()  The shareholders then sought a bill for a railway from Bolton to Manchester and on 23 August 1831 obtained an Act of Parliament to become the Company of Proprietors of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company.((  They were empowered to build a line from Manchester to Bolton and Bury, upon or near the line of ... the Canal, and a branch from Clifton Aqueduct through to Lever.  In 1832 this company obtained an Act that allowed it to build the railway.()  Due mainly to the objections of local mine owners who would have lost access to the canal and supplies, and would not have had branch railways built for them, the company agreed to an amending bill which would keep the canal and allow the new railway to be constructed alongside it.()()  Due to technical and financial constraints the branch to Bury was never built.()  The canal therefore survived, although locks 4 and 5 in Salford were moved and combined into a two-rise staircase, with a second tunnel built underneath the line()() which became known as the and Bolton Railway.The line opened on 28 May 1838,() and the company had purchased four locomotives from Curtis, and Kennedy, two from Forrester and Company, and two from Fairbairn & Sons.()  Between the opening date and 9 January 1839 the railway carried 228,799 passengers  far more than had been carried on the canal.()  Shortly thereafter passenger services on the canal ceased and the boats were sold off.  In 1846 the company was taken over by the and Leeds Railway,( which itself became the and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR) the following year.  In 1890 the L&YR widened the line through Salford.  Locks 4, 5 and 6 were moved slightly to the north and the tunnel under the railway was replaced by a bridge (although it is still referred to as a tunnel).()In 1922 the L&YR amalgamated into the and North Western Railway, and in 1923 this company amalgamated into the Midland and Scottish Railway.  This company was nationalised in 1948 under the Act 1947 and became part of Railways. Decline By 1924 there had been a significant reduction in the use of the Bolton arm, though the coal trade remained brisk until the 1930s when the effects of colliery closures reduced traffic.(  Canal had fallen into disuse by 1935, and bank bursts alongside the Irwell and Croal rivers (caused largely by subsidence from mining activities) were common.  A major breach of the canal occurred in 1936, and this was never repaired. Creams Paper Mill purchased  of disused canal and adjacent land from the Transport Commission around the area of the 1936 breach and built over part of the canal.()On Tuesday 2 March 1937 the London, Midland and Scottish Railway held a General Meeting and proposed an application to the Minister of Transport to abandon a section of the canal from Clifton Aqueduct to Bailey Bridge, from Bailey Bridge to Bury, and the entire Bolton arm from Nob End Locks to Bolton.( Retrieved on 2008-06-29)  This proposal was not carried.() However, four years later under the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Act of 1941,  of the canal were abandoned, including a section from Prestolee to Clifton, and all of the Bolton arm.()  In 1939 during the Second World War, a half-mile long section in Agecroft was ordered piped by the Ministry of Transport to reduce the risk of German bomb damage to the canal affecting the adjacent Magnesium Elektron Companys site.(The canal continued to generate some revenue from the sale of water, while tolls produced only a small proportion of the canals income.  In 1946 the canal earned a total of 7,296 of which only 471 was from tolls, against expenses of 12,500() and in 1951 total income was 8,815 against a total expenditure of 9,574.() In the same year, the canal carried  of coal, and no other materials.()A report commissioned in 1955 by the British Transport Commission included the canal in a list of Waterways having insufficient commercial prospects to justify their retention for navigation.()  The canal was abandoned in 1961 following an Act of Parliament,(( Retrieved on 2008-07-01) although a single coal delivery service between Sion Street and Bury Moors continued until 1968, the last commercial traffic to use the canal. Features thumb|left|Nob End Locks in operationThere are several notable features along the canal, including Aqueduct and Aqueduct, both of which are Grade II listed structures.(. Retrieved on 27 June 2008.)(. Retrieved on 27 June 2008.) Nob End Locks (sometimes referred to as Prestolee Locks) sit at the junction of the three arms of the canal at Nob End. They comprise two sets of three locks, separated by a passing basin. These locks served to lower the level of the canal by  over a distance of . The upper staircase is still visible, but most of the lower staircase was filled in at some point in the 1950s, and much of the stonework was removed.()A major breach of the canal along the Bury arm revealed the scale of the engineering used in the construction of the retaining wall.  Railway rails, which were used to increase the strength of the walls, are still clearly visible at the site of the breach.()The Mount Sion crane (a depiction of which is used as the logo of the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal Society) sits rusting and unused at Mount Sion, on the Bury arm.  The crane was built in 1884 for Mount Sion Bleach Works by J Smith & Sons of West Yorkshire and was used to unload coal boxes from barges into the yard below the canal.( Design and construction right|thumb|upright|Reinforcements along the Bury arm help keep the canal bank from sliding down the valley.The original source of water for the canal was the Irwell in Bury, at the Weddell Brook tributary.  This was, however, insufficient for the needs of local industry and in 1842 Reservoir at Bury( ) was constructed as the principal supply for the canal.(  Although the Bury and Bolton arms are on one level, the Salford arm used seventeen broad locks, including some in staircases (Nob End, for example), to descend  over  from the summit level to the lowest point at Salford.()  Fulton had proposed an inclined plane at Nob End, but this design was rejected.()()  The connection with Canal near Clifton Aqueduct was made by a single lock(  long by  wide, with a drop of .(Although the canal was originally designed to be a narrow canal with narrow locks for boats  wide, in 1794 an agreement was reached with the and Liverpool Canal company to create a link near Red Moss near Horwich, so broad locks were built to accommodate the  wide boats using that canal.(  This meant removing some of the narrow locks that had already been built.(  An extension to the original canal feeder was built at Weddell Brook in Bury, alongside the River Irwell. The route of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was changed, however, and the planned link never materialised.  The design changes to the canal were not completely without merit, since they allowed two narrowboats to use each lock simultaneously, saving passage time and water.Much of the Bury arm of the canal runs alongside the River Irwell through the Irwell Valley, and eventually required the construction of huge retaining walls to prevent the canal bank from sliding down the hill.(  Similar strengthening, although on a smaller scale, was required on the Bolton arm where it ran alongside the Croal.()  Through these sections the towpath is normally on the side of the canal closest to the river.Six aqueducts were required to allow the canal to cross the River Irwell, the Tonge and four roads. On the Bolton arm these were Hall Lane Aqueduct, Foggs Aqueduct and the larger Damside Aqueduct, all of which have since been demolished.  Hall Lane Aqueduct was damaged by mining subsidence and replaced in 18841885.  It was demolished in 1950.() The Salford arm flowed over Aqueduct, then Aqueduct, and finally the smaller Lumns Lane Aqueduct (since demolished).Many bridges were also constructed, along the length of the canal.  Most were of small design allowing access to farmland, although many are wide enough for a and cart.  In places where the canal crossed important thoroughfares, such as Water Street in Radcliffe, Radcliffe Road in Lever and Agecroft Road in Salford, larger bridges were constructed.Cranes were used along the many wharfs on the canal to offload cargo.  One of these, a crane at Mount Sion, still exists (albeit in poor condition).  At Bury Wharf a traversing steam crane positioned between the two arms of the terminus would offload cargo to be loaded into waiting lorries( and a similar system was used at Radcliffe Wharf. Costs In 1795 costs of construction were detailed as follows:(The total cost of construction was 127,700. Breaches right|thumb|Contemporary view of the 1936 breach at Nob EndThroughout its history the canal has suffered several major breaches.  As early as 1799 a flood carried away large sections of the lower banks,( and another such incident occurred on 15 October 1853 when two boats were swept through a  breach near the bottom of Nob End Locks, although nobody was injured.( Retrieved on 2008-06-29)  Subsidence due to mining caused a breach near Agecroft in 1881.(As a result of such incidents, from 1881 to 1888 the engineer Edwin Muir was employed to undertake work to reduce damage from subsidence caused by mining activity,() and more work was carried out for the same purpose throughout the 1920s.  Maps from the 1880s show that the canal company had purchased areas of coal beneath the canal to safeguard against further subsidence.()In 1884 the and Yorkshire Railway, which at this time owned the canal, successfully pursued an action against the colliery owners Knowles & Sons to claim compensation for damage that subsidence caused by their mining had done to the canal.  After the judgement the railway company settled out of court with other colliery owners.(  Constant repairs were required to correct the subsidence, particularly through Pendleton where the embankment had to be raised periodically, with some bridges raised many feet above their original supports.  Some bridges sank as low as  above head height.()The most serious breach occurred on 6 July 1936 at Nob End, close to Nob End Locks near the junction of the three arms of the canal.  This breach was never repaired, and although the canal saw continued use between Ladyshore Colliery and Bury, it eventually closed in 1961.  The Evening News reported the breach on 7 July 1936:() Current status thumb|right|The canal north of Agecroft Road, in water at this point. The towpath here was cleared of overgrowth in 2007.thumb|right|The 1936 breach at Nob End, in 2008Almost 60% of the original length of the canal is no longer in water.  Bury Wharf is now an industrial estate and the section between this wharf, and the first part of the canal still in water south of Viaduct, is more accessible; a car park has been built near the viaduct but there has been no further building here.(  A small section is infilled, and the canal is in water until Water Street in Radcliffe, although overgrown with weeds.  Water Street now blocks the canal, which continues under the road through a small culvert built in the 1960s.  The canal remains in water up to the point where it is dammed at Ladyshore, following which an empty paper mill building, built in 1956, is found on the line of the canal.(The 1936 breach, never repaired, presents a large gap in the canal route, and there is no towpath at this point.  On the Salford arm, the locks at Prestolee are completely derelict although the top three locks are still in good condition.  The canal is in water from the bottom of the lock flight until it reaches Ringley Locks.  Ringley Bridge is infilled, and the line of the canal is filled throughout Ringley Village, and through Giants Seat Locks.  Kilcoby Bridge is missing and the line of the canal is inaccessible from this point up to the motorway.  Rhodes Lock is still in reasonable condition, although completely overgrown, and one or more pylons straddle the infilled canal between Rhodes Lock and the motorway, which has been built over the line of the canal.  A sludge lagoon built during the construction of the motorway also blocks a short section of canal between the motorway and Clifton Aqueduct.  The canal does not take water again until beyond Clifton Aqueduct, where a short  length exists between Pilkingtons and the Enersys factory.()  Lumns Lane aqueduct is missing but the canal is in water between Lumns Lane and Holland Street. Beyond this point the canal has been filled-in and some parts built over, especially through Pendleton.  The canal at the junction with the River Irwell in Salford has recently been restored to operation and is navigable.The Bolton arm of the canal is interrupted by the absence of Hall Lane Aqueduct at Little Lever, which was demolished in 1950 to make way for the widening of Hall Lane.()  In Darcy Lever, Damside Aqueduct, which crossed Radcliffe Road and the Tonge River, is also missing, having been demolished in June 1965.  The route of St Peters Way has almost entirely destroyed a significant section of the canal as it heads into the centre of Bolton() and Church Wharf no longer exists.  The last section of the Bolton arm of the canal still in water is currently used for fishing.( )The entire route of the canal is protected from any adverse development that would prevent the restoration of the canal, having been included in the Unitary development plans of Salford City Council,() Bolton Council,() and Bury Council.() Restoration right|thumb|John Fletcher on the Prince William, the first boat into the newly restored section of canal.right|thumb|Recent cleanup work at Nob End Locks by volunteersThe Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal Society was formed in 1987 to protect the line of the canal.  Despite the problems mentioned above, on 21 October 2005 Waterways announced funding from European Objective Two Funding, the Regional Development Agency (NWDA) and Salford City Council for the restoration at the newly named Middlewood Locks in Salford,() which began in September 2006.  Completion of this section was scheduled for the end of July 2008,() and was marked with an opening ceremony on 19 September 2008.()  It is hoped that the full length of the canal will eventually be restored to operation by 2020.  The restoration of the canal could create up to 6,000 jobs and add 6M to the local economy each year.() The locks and all of the canal at Middlewood have already been dug out and are visible for the first time in many years, with new wash walls replacing the missing stonework.()  Asbestos was found in the infill, and there were delays to the work whilst an application was made to HM Revenue and Customs for an exemption licence to the landfill tax: The licence has been applied for because small quantities of asbestos (less than 1%) within the material remaining mean that a separate registered disposal tip has to be used.(  Restoration was also halted briefly by the discovery of what was initially thought to be a Second World War bomb,() but which proved to be a wartime American mortar with no explosive contents.The new Margaret Fletcher tunnel under the Inner Ring Road was formally named on 19 September 2008.()( )()  Pilings for the tunnel under the to Preston Line have also been completed, allowing tunnelling to continue further along the route.() The missing Irwell towpath bridge across the canal entrance, formerly known as Bloody Bridge, has been replaced with an arched timber structure, incorporating elements of the old Lock 3.()  Much of the existing masonry from the canal has been re-used, including coping stones around Lock 3, and the original washwalls have been grouted and pointed where possible.(  The original river locks 1 and 2 have now been replaced by a single deep lock.The total cost of restoration of the canal is estimated at 60M,( with the next stage of the work planned for the section through Salford Crescent.()()Local volunteers have for many years worked along sections of the canal, removing overgrowth and tidying up the general appearance,() and the Manchester Bolton and Bury Canal Society routinely organises working parties.

Morley,_West_Yorkshire
Morley is a town and civil parish within the borough of the of Leeds, in Yorkshire, England. It lies approximately  south-west of city centre. Together with Drighlington, Gildersome, Churwell, Tingley and East/Ardsley, the town had a population of 47,579 in the 2001 census.()  The civil parish had a population of 27,738.The town is built on seven hills, like Rome: Scatcherd Hill, Dawson Hill, Daisy Hill, Chapel Hill, Hunger Hill, Troy Hill and Banks Hill.HistoryMorley means wood by a moor, from Old English mor moor + leah wood, clearing. The name was recorded as Morelige in 1156. The -ley in the place name is typical of this section of Yorkshire, alluding to a forest that was around in medieval times.Morley, mentioned in the 1086 Book as Morelege, Morelei and Moreleia, is traditionally famous for its textile industry, notably the cloth Shoddy, which was worn by both sides in the Civil War.Schoolgirl Sarah Harper was murdered by Robert Black in Morley in 1986, giving the town brief, national notoriety.A fuller description of the history of the town is provided by the West Yorkshire Archaeology Service and Morley Community Archives - see external links below.GovernanceHistorically, Morley was the centre of one of two divisions of the wapentake of and Morley. Morley became a Borough in 1889 and under the Government Act 1972, was incorporated into the new of Leeds Metropolitan District. Morley is represented on City Council by three wards (Morley North/Morley South and Ardsley/Robin Hood) each with three councillors. In May 2006 the electoral ward of Morley South voted for a councillor from the National Party. The town had previously faced negative publicity following a controversial speech in 2004 by BNP leader Griffin at Town Hall where he allegedly aired racist views. Griffin was later unsuccessfully tried on suspicion of incitement to racial hatred following the speech.()A council was established in 2000, though it no longer governs Drighlington, Gildersome, Tingley and East and Ardsley - areas formerly part of the borough.Following a review of parliamentary representation in West Yorkshire, the Morley and Rothwell parliamentary constituency, represented by Challen (Labour) was abolished at the 2010 election and replaced by the new Morley and Outwood constituency.The towns Municipal Coat of Arms features the symbolic principal industries of the Borough: Manufacturing of Woollen Cloth, Coal Mining and Quarrying.GeographyPresentTown Hall is sometimes used for music recordings. It has also been used in television shows Heartbeat and Emmerdale, owing to there being a disused magistrates court inside the building and a cobblestoned street to one side. It also hosts concerts by local schools and performances by the Morley Amateur Operatic Society, whose pantomimes have taken place at the Alexandra Hall for many years.The town is perhaps most notable as the home of Orbit(http://www.theorbituary.com/showthread.php?t313) - one of the U.Ks foremost clubs, which hosted the worlds biggest techno, trance and house DJs.(http://www.theorbituary.com/showthread.php?t3172)  During the late nineties, the club became a mecca of Northern rave culture until its sudden closure in 2003.There are three main supermarkets in Morley: a Morrisons in the town centre, an Asda to the south side of Morley, and a Sainsburys at the Rose Centre which lies on the outskirts of Morley, towards Beeston and Holbeck.On 21 February 2010, a stone statue of Wise was erected outside Morley Post Office on Queen Street, and is now a tourist attraction in the town. The statue was officially unveiled by Ernies widow, Doreen Wiseman.()(http://www.morleyobserver.co.uk/news/Heart-to-heart-with-Ernie.6136195.jp)Transportrailway station is half a mile (800 metres) from the town centre on the Line. There is a regular service six days a week to and from Leeds. On Sundays it is less frequent.Buses go to Leeds, Bradford, Wakefield and other West Yorkshire towns from bus stops in the vicinity of the Town Hall.The motorway runs to the west of the town and the Motorway to the south. Junctions 27 and 28 of the M62 are the ones closest to Morley.EducationThree secondary schools serve pupils from Morley: Morley Academy (formerly Morley High School and Morley Grammar), High School and High School (technically in Ardsley but has a large proportion of students from Morley due to its catchment area). City College offers Education at numerous sites in the town. It also has an independent preparatory school; Queenswood School, which is based in a conservation area within the town centre.SportR.F.C. was founded in 1878 and was a member of the Northern Union. When the Northern Union clubs broke away from the RFU to form what is now league, the Morley representatives missed the coach to Huddersfield as they were still in the pub. The clubs heyday was in the 1970s where they won the Yorkshire Cup on five occasions. Some of this glory was recaptured in April 2005 when the club won the Powergen Intermediate Cup at Twickenham.The town also has a cricket club (whose team plays in the Bradford League), along with a football club (Morley Town) and league club (Morley Borough).Independent Wrestling company Dynamic Pro Wrestling (DPW) are based in Morley and put on monthly shows in Morley and around West Yorkshire.FilmographyMorley is one of the main settings for the critically acclaimed and award winning Peaces Red Riding Quartet novel and 2009 television series which explore West Yorkshire police corruption during the 1970s and 1980s.Twin towns*   Siegen, Germany, since 1966.Notable peopleNatives of the town refer to themselves as Morleians.

Wieliczka
 website  http://www.wieliczka.gmina.pl  Wieliczka  is a town (2006 population: 19,128) in southern Poland in the Krakw area, and situated (since 1999) in Poland Voivodeship; previously, it was in Voivodeship (19751998). The town was founded in 1290 by Duke Premislas II of Poland. The city is twinned with Bergkamen, Germany.()Geographic locationThe city of Wieliczka lies in the south central part of Poland, within the Maopolska region of historic Carniola. These were also land in the Krakw areas. The city is located to the southeast of Krakw. Under the town is the Salt Mine &ndash; one of the worlds oldest operating mines (the oldest is at Bochnia, Poland,  from Wieliczka), which has been in operation since prehistoric times.(Jerzy Grzesiowski, Wieliczka:  kopalnia, muzeum, zamek (Wieliczka:  the Mine, the Museum, the Castle), 2nd ed., updated and augmented, Warsaw, Sport i Turystyka, 1987, ISBN 83-217-2637-2.)The town lies in a valley between two ridges that stretch from west to east: south Wieliczka foothills, north Bogucice sands, including the Wieliczka-Gdw Upland. The south ridge is higher, while the northern ridge leads to national road 94. Near the town lies the A4 highway (E40 European route), which in a near future will connect Krakw to Ukraine. Despite the small area, the citys relative altitude accounts for more than 137 &ndash;m&ndash;: the highest mountain reaches 361,8 metres above the sea, and the lowest point lies at an altitude of 224 metres above sea level.HistoryMedieval timesThe first settlers were probably from the Celtic tribes. In later years they were driven out by the Slavic population. The importance of mining deposits arose after the capital of Poland was moved from Gniezno to Krakw by I the Restorer. Brewing brought huge revenues, which the prince needed to maintain the court and rebuild the destroyed country. Systematic development of the mining settlement stopped the Tartar invasion, which destroyed Krakw and surroundings. In 1252 deposits of salt and potasium were discovered and henceforthward the extration of salt reached deep regions in the earth. In the year 1289, IV Probus, then Lord of Krakw issued a document authorising the brothers Jeskowi and Hysinboldowi to rule the town of Wieliczka. The next year Duke II gave Wieliczka privileges and in 1311, during the reign of Wadysaw okietek, then General Secretary of de Kulpen joined the of wjt Albert. After terminating the rebellion Albert fled to Silesia, where he served as Steward of Wieliczka.17th to 18th centuryIn 1651 the Wieliczka population was decimated by a plague. In the years 1655-1660, at the time of the Swedish invasion, the city was in economic decline. The mine was plundered and burned by the Swedes. The Swedish crew guarded the mine and the taxes were raised upon the population. Wojniowicz alongside with Sebastian Lubomirski proceeded to organize approximately 3,000 people which took part in the liberation of Wieliczka, Bochnia and Winicz. The battle took place in Lesser Poland Voivodeship, where the Poles attacked the hill, and referred their victory.18th to 19th centuryOn 9 June 1772 the occupation of Wieliczka by the forces of the Austrian began. In 1809 Wieliczka was incorporated into the of Warsaw by the Austrians and so the Habsburgs regained the city after the fall of the Duchy and its partition by the of Vienna. From then on the official German name Gro Salz became part of Galicia. In the time of the partition, unemployment arose because the Austrians brought modern equipment which caused a cease of production throughout the city and surrounding areas, due to low wages, forcing were dismiss en masse of Polish miners. That led to the arrival of German, Hungarian, Croatian and Transylvanian miners, changing so the ethnic composition of the city in favor of the immigrant population. After the outbreak of the uprising in 1846 in Krakw by Dembowski, who became Secretary to Tyssowski, the dictator of the revolution, the miners seized power in the Wieliczka salt mine. In the period of Galician autonomy there was a gradual development of the city. The mine became the largest in concentration of miners in Galicia. In the Nitra district, there were over 2000 workers employed.20th to 21st centuryOnly by the end of the nineteenth century there was public housing development. The city expanded with private money, mining built colonies (settlement for families of mining workers), a salinarn power plant (supplied electricity not only to the mine, but also to the city). In the inter-war period, Wieliczkaits  saw the development of territorial area, new residential districts were formed until that in 1933 a miners strike took place, due to the reduction of wages by 13%. On 7 September 1939 began the occupation of Poland by the German army, which entered the country coming from Slovakia. The city was crowded, as Wieliczka moved approximately 5.4 thousand people of Jewish origin to Krakw after the opening of the ghetto. On 21 January 1945 the Soviet army invaded Wieliczka. After War II, began a period of systematic development of the city. In 1978 UNESCO decided to list Wielick salt mine as a world cultural heritage. In 1994 the city was declared a historical monument.GalerySee also* of twin towns and sister cities in PolandReferences;Attribution**External links**Exhibition of Technique in Wieliczka*Wieliczka County page*Wieliczka on Interactive map of Krakw()ca:Wieliczkacs:Wieliczkade:Wieliczkaes:Wieliczkaeo:Wieliczkafr:Wieliczkahr:Wieliczkaid:Wieliczkait:Wieliczkajv:Wieliczkalv:Veika(miestas)nl:Wieliczkaja:pl:Wieliczkapt:Wieliczkaro:Wieliczkaru:sk:Wieliczkasv:Wieliczka()war:Wieliczka

Sodium_bicarbonate
 InChIKey  UIIMBOGNXHQVGW-REWHXWOFAQ| Section2   RefractIndex  1.3344| Section3  | Section4  | Section8  }}Sodium bicarbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate is the compound with the formula NaHCO3. Sodium bicarbonate is a white solid that is crystalline but often appears as a fine powder. It has a slightly salty, alkaline taste resembling that of washing soda (carbonate). The natural mineral form is nahcolite. It is a component of the mineral natron and is found dissolved in many springs. It is found in dissolved form in bile, where it serves to neutralize the acidity of the acid produced by the stomach, and is excreted into the duodenum of the small intestine via the bile duct. It is also produced artificially.Since it has long been known and is widely used, the salt has many related names such as baking soda, bread soda, cooking soda, and bicarbonate of soda. In colloquial usage, its name is shortened to sodium bicarb, bicarb soda, or simply bicarb. The word saleratus, from Latin sal ratus meaning aerated salt, was widely used in the 19th century for both sodium bicarbonate and bicarbonate. The term has now fallen out of common usage.HistoryThe Egyptians used natural deposits of natron, a mixture consisting mostly of carbonate decahydrate, and sodium bicarbonate. The natron was used as a cleansing agent like soap.In 1791, a French chemist, Leblanc, produced sodium carbonate, also known as soda ash. In 1846, two New York bakers, John Dwight and Austin Church, established the first factory to develop baking soda from sodium carbonate and dioxide.()ProductionNaHCO3 is mainly prepared by the process, which is the reaction of chloride, ammonia, and dioxide in water. Calcium carbonate is used as the source of CO2 and the resultant calcium oxide is used to recover the ammonia from the Ammonium Chloride It is produced on the scale of about 100,000 tonnes/year (as of 2001).(Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. Inorganic Chemistry Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. ISBN 0-12-352651-5.)NaHCO3 may be obtained by the reaction of carbon dioxide with an solution of hydroxide. The initial reaction produces carbonate::CO2 + 2 NaOH  Na2CO3 + H2OFurther addition of carbon dioxide produces sodium bicarbonate, which at sufficiently high concentration will precipitate out of solution::Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O  2 NaHCO3Commercial quantities of baking soda are also produced by a similar method: soda ash, mined in the form of the ore trona, is dissolved in water and treated with carbon dioxide. Sodium bicarbonate precipitates as a solid from this method:: Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O  2 NaHCO3MiningNaturally occurring deposits of nahcolite (NaHCO3) are found in the Eocene-age (55.833.9 Ma) River Formation, Basin in Colorado. Nahcolite was deposited as beds during periods of high evaporation in the basin. It is commercially mined using in-situ leach techniques involving dissolution of the nahcolite by heated water that is pumped through the nahcolite beds and reconstituted through a natural cooling crystallization process.ChemistrySodium bicarbonate is an amphoteric compound. Aqueous solutions are mildly alkaline due to the formation of acid and hydroxide ion::HCO + H2O   + OHSodium bicarbonate can be used as a wash to remove any acidic impurities from a crude liquid, producing a purer sample. Reaction of sodium bicarbonate and an acid produce a salt and carbonic acid, which readily decomposes to carbon dioxide and water::NaHCO3 + HCl  NaCl + H2CO3:H2CO3  H2O + CO2(g)Sodium bicarbonate reacts with acid (found in vinegar) and presents a simple and showy demonstration of a reaction. The products of the two-stage reaction are acetate, water, and dioxide::NaHCO3 + CH3COOH  CH3COONa + H2O + CO2(g)Sodium bicarbonate reacts with bases such as hydroxide to form carbonates::NaHCO3 + NaOH  Na2CO3 + H2OSodium bicarbonate reacts with groups in proteins to give a brisk effervescence from the formation of . This reaction is used to test for the presence of carboxylic groups in protein.Thermal decompositionAbove 70 C, sodium bicarbonate gradually decomposes into carbonate, water and dioxide. The conversion is fast at 200 C:(): 2 NaHCO3  Na2CO3 + H2O + CO2Most bicarbonates undergo this reaction. Further heating converts the carbonate into the oxide (at ca. 1000 C):: Na2CO3  Na2O + CO2These conversions are relevant to the use of NaHCO3 as a fire-suppression agent (BC powder) in some dry powder extinguishers.ApplicationsCookingSodium bicarbonate, referred to as baking soda is primarily used in cooking (baking), as a agent. It reacts with acidic components in batters, releasing carbon dioxide, which causes expansion of the batter and forms the characteristic texture and grain in pancakes, cakes, quick breads, and other baked and fried foods. Acidic compounds that induce this reaction include phosphates, of tartar, lemon juice, yogurt, buttermilk, cocoa, vinegar, etc. Sodium bicarbonate can be substituted for powder provided sufficient acid reagent is also added to the recipe.(Radiation Cookery Book 45th Edition, Radiation Group Sales Ltd 1954) Many forms of baking powder contain sodium bicarbonate combined with one or more acidic phosphates (especially good) or cream of tartar.Sodium bicarbonate was sometimes used in cooking vegetables, to make them softer, although this has gone out of fashion, as most people now prefer firmer vegetables that contain more nutrients. However, it is still used in Asian cuisine to tenderise meats. Bicarb may react with acids in food, including C (L-ascorbic acid). It is also used in breadings such as for fried foods to enhance crispness.Thermal decomposition causes sodium bicarbonate alone to act as a raising agent by releasing carbon dioxide at baking temperatures. The carbon dioxide production starts at temperatures above 80 C. The mixture for cakes using this method can be allowed to stand before baking without any premature release of carbon dioxide.Neutralization of acids and basesMany laboratories keep a bottle of sodium bicarbonate powder within easy reach, because sodium bicarbonate is amphoteric, reacting with acids and bases. Furthermore, as it is relatively innocuous in most situations, there is no harm in using excess sodium bicarbonate. Also, sodium bicarbonate powder may be used to smother a small fire, as heating of sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide.(A wide variety of applications follows from its neutralization properties, including reducing the spread of phosphorus from incendiary bullets inside an afflicted soldiers wounds.() Sodium bicarbonate can be added as a simple solution for raising the pH balance of water (increasing total alkalinity) where high levels of chlorine (25 ppm) are present as in swimming pools and aquariums.()Medical usesSodium bicarbonate is used in an solution as an antacid taken orally to treat indigestion and heartburn.() It may also be used in an oral form to treat chronic forms of metabolic acidosis such as renal failure and tubular acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate may also be useful in urinary alkalinization for the treatment of overdose and acid renal stones. It is used as the medicinal ingredient in water for infants.(List of ingredients  Life Brand Gripe Water)Sodium bicarbonate has been known to be used in first aid, in treating scalding, to prevent blistering and scarring with instructions to cover the scalded area with a liberal layer of sodium bicarbonate and water paste and seek medical assistance. This is due to the endothermic reaction that occurs between sodium bicarbonate and water and sodium bicarbonates mild antiseptic properties () sodium bicarbonate is an aqueous solution that is sometimes used for cases of acidosis, or when there are insufficient sodium or bicarbonate ions in the blood.() In cases of respiratory acidosis, the infused bicarbonate ion drives the carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer of plasma to the left and, thus, raises the pH. It is for this reason that sodium bicarbonate is used in medically supervised resuscitation. Infusion of bicarbonate is indicated only when the blood pH is marked (<7.17.0) low.()It is used as well for treatment of hyperkalemia. Since sodium bicarbonate can cause alkalosis, it is sometimes used to treat aspirin overdoses. Aspirin requires an acidic environment for proper absorption, and the basic environment diminishes aspirin absorption in the case of an overdose. Sodium bicarbonate has also been used in the treatment of antidepressant overdose.() It can also be applied topically as a paste, with three parts baking soda to one part water, to relieve insect bites.()Adverse reactions to the administration of sodium bicarbonate can include alkalosis, edema due to sodium overload, heart failure, syndrome, hypervolemic hypernatremia, and hypertension due to increased sodium. In patients consuming a high-calcium or dairy-rich diet, supplements, or calcium-containing antacids such as carbonate (e.g., Tums), the use of sodium bicarbonate can cause syndrome, which can result in calcification, stones, and failure.Sodium bicarbonate can be used to cover an allergic reaction of poison ivy, oak, or sumac to relieve some of the itching that is associated with it (an alternative to buying hydrocortisone cream).(What is Sodium Bicarbonate Used For?. Virtuowl.com. Retrieved on 2010-09-24.)Personal hygieneSodium bicarbonate can be used as an exfoliant. Its particles are rounded and fine in texture, making it both effective and gentle on the skin. Using baking soda as an exfoliating scrub will remove dead skin cells, which can be discolored from hyperpigmentation and scarring.Sodium bicarbonate is also used as an ingredient in some mouthwashes. It works as a mechanical cleanser on the teeth and gums, neutralizes the production of acid in the mouth and also as an antiseptic to help prevent infections occurring.A paste made from sodium bicarbonate and a 3% peroxide solution can be used as an alternative to commercial non-fluoride toothpastes, and sodium bicarbonate in combination with other ingredients can be used to make a dry or wet deodorant. It may also be used as a shampoo.()Baking soda in sportsSmall amounts of sodium bicarbonate have been shown to be useful as a supplement for athletes in speed-based events, like middle distance running, lasting from about one to seven minutes.()(Ergogenic Aids. U. Retrieved on 2011-09-11.) But overdose is a serious risk because sodium bicarbonate is slightly toxic(Baking soda overdose  All Information. Umm.edu (2009-10-19). Retrieved on 2010-09-24.) and in particular gastrointestinal irritation is of concern.( Additionally this practice causes a significant increase in dietary sodium.As a cleaning agentA paste from baking soda can be very effective when used in cleaning and scrubbing.() For cleaning aluminium objects, the use of sodium bicarbonate is discouraged as it attacks the thin unreactive protective oxide layer of this otherwise very reactive metal. A solution in warm water will remove the tarnish from silver when the silver is in contact with a piece of foil.(Eco Silver Polishing. instructables.com (2006-12-20). Retrieved on 2011-10-07.)()Baking soda is commonly added to washing machines as a replacement for softener and also to remove odors from clothes. Sodium bicarbonate is also effective in removing heavy tea and coffee stains from cups when diluted with warm water.Cattle feed supplementSodium bicarbonate is sold as a cattle feed supplement, in particular as a agent for the rumen.MiscellaneousSodium bicarbonate can be used to extinguish small grease or electrical fires by being thrown over the fire.() However, it should not be applied to fires in fryers, as it may cause the grease to splatter.( Sodium bicarbonate is used in BC dry chemical extinguishers as an alternative to the more corrosive phosphate in ABC extinguishers. The alkali nature of sodium bicarbonate makes it the only dry chemical agent, besides Purple-K, that was used in large-scale fire suppression systems installed in commercial kitchens. Because it can act as an alkali, the agent has a mild saponification effect on hot grease, which forms a smothering soapy foam. Dry chemicals have since fallen out of favor for kitchen fires, as they have no cooling effect compared to the extremely effective wet chemical agents specifically designed for such hazards.Sodium bicarbonate is used in a process for cleaning paint called sodablasting. It can be administered to pools, spas, and garden ponds to raise pH levels.() It has weak disinfectant properties,()() and it may be an effective fungicide against some organisms.()Since it acts as a neutralizing agent, it can be used to absorb odors that are caused by strong acids. It is a tried-and-true method of used-book sellers.

Great_Northern_Railway_(U.S.)
Image:Locomotive Great Northern Railway (US).JPG|thumb|292px|A Great Northern F7 Locomotive.The Great Northern Railway , running from Paul, Minnesota, to Seattle, Washington&mdash;more than 1,700 miles (2,736 km)&mdash;was the creation of the 19th century railroad tycoon James J. Hill and was developed from the Paul and Pacific Railroad. The Great Northerns route was the northernmost railroad route in the States and was north of the Pacific Railway route. It was completed on January 6, 1893, at Washington.The Great Northern was the only privately funded, and successfully built, transcontinental railroad in United States history. No federal land grants were used during its construction, unlike every other transcontinental railroad built. It was one of the few transcontinental railroads to avoid receivership following the of 1893.The Great Northern Railway also fell victim to the deadliest avalanche in United States history, at the site of the now non-existent town of Washington (later renamed, due to the disaster, to Washington).HistoryThe Great Northern was built in stages, slowly to create profitable lines, before extending the road further into the undeveloped Western territories.  In a series of the earliest public relations campaigns, contests were held to promote interest in the railroad and the ranchlands along its route. Fred J. Adams used promotional incentives such as feed and seed donations to farmers getting started along the line.  Contests were all-inclusive, from largest farm animals to largest freight carload capacity and were promoted heavily to immigrants & newcomers from the East.The earliest predecessor railroad to the GN was the Paul & Pacific Railroad, a bankrupt railroad with a small amount of track in the state of Minnesota. Hill convinced S. Kennedy (a York City banker), Kittson (Hills friend and a wealthy fur trader), Donald Smith (a Montreal banker and executive with the Bay Company), George Stephen (Smiths cousin and a wealthy railroad executive), and others to invest $5.5 million in purchasing the railroad.(Malone, p. 38-41.) On March 13, 1878, the roads creditors formally signed an agreement transferring their bonds and control of the railroad to Hills investment group.(Malone. p. 49.) On September 18, 1889, Hill changed the name of the and St. Cloud Railway (a railroad which existed primarily on paper, but which held very extensive land grants throughout the Midwest and Pacific Northwest) to the Great Northern Railway.(Yenne, p. 23.) On February 1, 1890, he transferred ownership of the StPM&M, Central Railway, and other rail systems he owned to the Great Northern.(The Great Northern had branches that ran north to the Canadian border in Minnesota, Dakota and Montana. It also had branches that ran to Wisconsin, and Montana, connecting with the iron mining fields of Minnesota and copper mines of Montana.  At its height, the Great Northern grew to a coordinated system of over 8,000 track miles.The mainline began at Saint Paul, Minnesota, heading west and topping the bluffs of the Mississippi River, crossing the river to Minneapolis on a massive multi-piered stone bridge. The Stone Arch Bridge stands in Minneapolis, near the Anthony Falls, the only waterfall on the Mississippi. The bridge ceased to be used as a railroad bridge in 1978 and is now used as a pedestrian river crossing with excellent views of the falls and of the lock system used to grant barges access up the river past the falls.  The mainline headed northwest from the Twin Cities to North Dakota, Montana, Idaho and the Rocky Mountains, reaching Washington, in 1893, with the driving of the last spike at Scenic, Washington, on January 6, 1893.The Great Northern mainline crossed the divide through Pass, the lowest crossing of the Rockies south of the Canadian border. Here, the rails enter Glacier National Park, which the GN promoted heavily as a tourist attraction. GN constructed stations at East Glacier and West Glacier entries to the park, stone and timber lodges at the entries and other inns & lodges throughout the Park. Many of the structures have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places due to unique construction, location and the beauty of the surrounding regions.In 1931 the GN also developed the Inside Gateway, a route to California that rivaled Southern Pacifics route between Oregon and California. The GN route was further east than the SP route and ran south from the River in Oregon.  The GN connected with the Western Pacific at California; the Western Pacific connected with the Topeka, and Santa Fe in California, and together the three railroads (GN, WP, and ATSF) competed with Southern Pacific for traffic between California and the Northwest.  With a terminus at Superior, Wisconsin, the Great Northern was able to provide transportation from the Pacific to the Atlantic by taking advantage of the shorter distance to Duluth from the ocean, as compared to Chicago.In 1970 the Great Northern, together with the Pacific Railway, the Burlington and Quincy Railroad and the Portland and Seattle Railway merged to form the Northern Railroad, today part of the Railway.The Great Northern Railway is considered to have inspired (in broad outline, not in specific details) the Taggart Transcontinental railroad in Rands Shrugged.(Ayn Rand, Leonard Peikoff, Peter Schwartz, The voice of reason: essays in objectivist thought (New American Library, 1989), pg. 92 http://books.google.com/books?idmyLXAAAAMAAJ&sourcegbs_navlinks_s)Passenger serviceThe Great Northern operated various passenger trains but the Builder was the GNs premier passenger train.

Clausthal-Zellerfeld
year                Clausthal-Zellerfeld is a town in Saxony, Germany. It is located in the southwestern part of the Harz mountains. Its population is approximately 15,000, Clausthal-Zellerfeld is also the seat of the Samtgemeinde (collective municipality) Oberharz. Geography  City districts * Buntenbock (since 1972)* Clausthal* Zellerfeld History Actually, Clausthal-Zellerfeld consists of two towns: Clausthal and Zellerfeld were merged in 1924 to form an administrative unit. Clausthal is well known for the old University of Technology and its magnificent buildings, while Zellerfeld is a typical tourist resort for hikers and winter sportsmen. Clausthal-Zellerfeld is the largest town in the area that is situated in the mountains rather than on the edge.Mining in the area began in the 16th century. Modern rope was invented to service the iron mines in the 1830s by the German mining engineer Albert in the years between 1831 and 1834 for use in mining in the Harz Mountains in Clausthal. It was quickly accepted because it proved superior to ropes made of hemp or to metal chains, such as had been used before and soon found its way into diverse applications, including most notably, bridges. Mining activity halted in 1930 because the ore deposits were exhausted and no longer financially valuable. Today, there are large remains of mines in the surrounding Harz region, some of which are now tourable museums. The University of Technology was established in 1763 for the education of mining engineers. Today, it is a technical university for teaching engineering.

His fief (and later state) was known as Oblast Brankovia (of Brankovi) or simply as Vukova zemlja (Vuks land) which he held with the title of gospodin (lord, sir), under Prince of Serbia. After the of Kosovo Vuk was briefly de facto most powerful Serbian lord.HistoryOriginsVuk Brankovi belonged to a noble Serbian family which held a prominent role in 13th and 14th century Serbia under the of Nemanji. Vuk was a son of Mladenovi (died before 1365), who received the high court title of sebastokrator from Emperor Duan (13311355) and served as governor of Ohrid (present day Macedonia). Vuks grandfather was Mladen (died after 1326), who was upan (count) in Trebinje under king Milutin (12821321) and vojvoda (duke) under king Deanski (13211331). Later chronicles derived origin of Brankovi family from Nemanji, son of the founder of Nemanji dynasty Nemanja, however this cant be taken with certainty.ExpansionAfter their fathers death, Vuk and his brothers Grgur and Radonja Nikola were forced by the usurper king Vukain to leave their land in western Macedonia (Ohrid), and they retreated to their ancestral lands in Drenica in the area of present day Kosovo. From there Vuk, who only held the humble title of gospodin (lord, sir), started to expand his realm and to create his own state. He took advantage of the death of king Mrnjavevi in the of Maritsa (1371) and occupied his lands in the southern part of Kosovo and northern Macedonia with the city of Skopje. The turning point of Vuks ascension to power in post-Nemanji Serbia was his marriage with Mara, daughter of the most powerful Serbian nobleman prince Hrebeljanovi, which brought him substantial lands in Kosovo and the city of Zvean as dowry. This marriage sealed the alliance between two houses and secured Lazars assistance for Vuks future plans, although Vuk in return had to acknowledge Lazar as his feuadal senior. Soon after the marriage, Lazar, Vuk and king I of Bosnia attacked upan Altomanovic, who ruled in the western part of Serbia, and conquered and divided his lands in 1373. In the partition of Altomanovis land, Vuk got areas of Raka (including the old Serbian capital Ras) and lands in Polimlje in present day northern Montenegro. The formation of the Realm of Brankovi was finished in 1378. After the death of Djuradj I Bali, Vuk captured his cities of Prizren and Pe and the area of Metohija.(John VA Fine, The Late Mediaeval Balkans,p.389) At its peak, the realm of Brankovi stretched from Sjenica in the west to Skopje in the east, with the cities of Pritina and Vuitrn serving as its capitals. The most important cities in Vuks Realm were Pritina, Prizren, Pe, Skopje and Ras, as well as the rich mining settlements of Trepa, Janjevo, Gluhavica and others.(M. irkovi, Vuk Toi, The Serbs,Wiley-Blackwell, 2004,p.79)Battle of Kosovo After the Battle of Maritza, Ottomans forced the southern Serbian feudal lords (in present-day Macedonia and Greece), Konstantin Draga, Marko, Toma Preljubovi and others, to become their vassals, and started to attack the northern Serbian lands ruled by prince Lazar and Vuk. After initial Serbian successes at the battles of Dubravnica (1381), Plonik (1386) and Bilea (1388), the Ottomans launched a full-scale attack on Serbia aiming at the very heartland of Vuks realm in central Kosovo. In the epic of Kosovo (1389), which ended with a strategic Serbian defeat, Vuk participated along with his father-in-law Lazar and a contingent of King Tvrtkos army. Unlike Lazar, who died in the battle along with most of his army, Vuk managed to survive and preserve his army, which later gave material for a popular Serbian folk tradition (represented in folk epic poems and tales) that he betrayed Lazar in order to become supreme ruler of Serbia, a theory that is rejected by modern day Serbian historians.(M. irkovi, Vuk Toi, The Serbs,Wiley-Blackwell, 2004,p.83-85) Despite the consensus of modern historiography in Serbia that Vuk Brankovi was not a traitor in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, Spremi emphasized that there is a possibility that Vuk really betrayed his Serbian allies.()thumb|left|200px|Kosovo Field with probable disposition of troops before the battleLast YearsAfter the Battle of Kosovo, Vuk refused to become an Ottoman vassal (unlike prince Lazarevi, son of prince Lazar, who became an Ottoman vassal in late 1389), and started to plan anti-Ottoman action together with the Hungarian king Sigismund. However, Vuk was unable to resist the Ottomans for long. In 1392, they captured Skopje and forced Vuk to become their vassal and pay tribute. Even after that Vuk showed some resistance to Ottomans, refusing to participate on the Ottoman side in the battles of Rovine (1395) and Nicopolis (1396), unlike other Serbian lords such as prince Stefan, king Marko and Konstantin Dejanovi. He also maintained contacts with Hungary. Finally the Ottomans ended this situation by attacking Vuk in 1395-1396, seizing his land and giving most of it to prince Stefan Lazarevi, while Vuk himself was imprisoned and died in an Ottoman prison. A small part of Vuks land with the towns of Pritina and Vuitrn were given to his sons to hold it as Ottoman vassals.(John VA Fine, The Late Mediaeval Balkans,p.409-415.)FamilyHe married Mara, the daughter of Hrebeljanovic and Milica Nemanji in 1371, she died on April 12, 1426. They had three sons:*Brankovi, died 13 March 1408.*Despot Brankovi, died 24 December 1456.*Brankovi, died 12 July 1410.In epic poetry and popular cultureFolk tradition portraits Vuk as a traitor: supposedly, Vuk tarnished the family name when he betrayed Lazar at the of Kosovo, which he survived in 1389. This tradition may be apocryphal.(ISBN 86-447-0006-5: Batakovi: The Kosovo Chronicles: Part One: History and Ideology)ReferencesBrankoviBrankoviBrankoviBrankoviBrankoviBrankoviBrankoviBrankoviBrankoviBrankovi

Noble_metals
thumb|right|The noble metals including mercury and rhenium together with the non-noble metal copper ordered according their position in the periodic table of the elementsNoble metals are metals that are resistant to corrosion and oxidation in moist air, unlike most metals. They tend to be precious, often due to their rarity in the Earths crust. The noble metals are considered to be (in order of increasing number) ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, osmium, iridium, platinum, and gold.(A. Holleman, N. Wiberg, Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie, de Gruyter, 1985, 33. edition, p. 1486)Other sources include mercury(Die Adresse fr Ausbildung, Studium und Beruf)(Dictionary of Mining, Mineral, and Related Terms,Compiled by the American Geological Institute, 2nd edition, 1997)(Scoullos, M.J., Vonkeman, G.H., Thornton, I., Makuch, Z., Mercury - Cadmium - Lead: Handbook for Sustainable Heavy Metals Policy and Regulation,Series: Environment & Policy, Vol. 31, Springer-Verlag, 2002) or even rhenium(The New Encyclopedia Britannica, 15th edition, Vol. VII, 1976) as a noble metal.On the other hand, neither titanium nor niobium nor tantalum are called noble metals despite the fact that they are very resistant to corrosion.Noble metals should not be confused with metals (although many noble metals are precious). Introduction Palladium, platinum, gold and mercury can be dissolved in regia, a highly concentrated mixture of acid and acid, but iridium and silver cannot. (Silver can dissolve in acid though.) Ruthenium can be dissolved in aqua regia only when in the presence of oxygen, while rhodium must be in a fine pulverized form. Niobium and tantalum are resistant to acids, including aqua regia.(A. Holleman, N. Wiberg, Inorganic Chemistry, Academic Press, 2001)This term can also be used in a relative sense, considering noble as an adjective for the word metal.  A series is a hierarchy of metals (or other electrically conductive materials, including composites and semimetals) that runs from noble to active, and allows designers to see at a glance how materials will interact in the environment used to generate the series.  In this sense of the word, graphite is more noble than silver and the relative nobility of many materials is highly dependent upon context, as for aluminium and steel in conditions of varying pH.(Everett Collier, The Boatowners Guide to Corrosion, International Marine Publishing, 2001, p. 21)In physics, the definition of a noble metal is even more strict. It is required that the d-bands of the electronic structure are filled. Taking this into account, only copper, silver and gold are noble metals, as all d-like band are filled and dont cross the level.() For platinum two d-bands cross the Fermi level, changing its chemical behaviour; it is used as a catalyst. The different reactivity can easily be seen while preparing clean metal surfaces in high vacuum; surfaces of physical defined noble metals (e.g., gold) are easy to clean and stay clean for a long time, while those of platinum or palladium, for example, are covered by monoxide very quickly.(S. Fuchs, T.Hahn, H.G. Lintz, The oxidation of carbon monoxide by oxygen over platinum, palladium and rhodium catalysts from 1010 to 1 bar, Chemical engineering and processing, 1994, V 33(5), pp. 363-369 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModeleafficheN&cpsidt3322977) Electrochemistry Metallic elements, including several non-noble metals, sorted by their chemical nobility (noble metals bolded):(D.

Lidle editor, CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 86th edition, 2005) The column group denotes its position in the table, hence electronic configuration.The simplified reactions, listed in the next column, can also be read in detail from the diagrams of the considered element in water.Finally the column potential indicates the electric potential of the element measured against a H-electrode in aqueous, pH 7 solution.All missing elements in this table are either not metals or have a negative standard potential.Antimony and polonium are considered metalloids and thus can not be noble metals. Also chemists and metallurgists consider copper and bismuth not noble metals because they easily oxidize due to the reaction O2 + 2H2O + 4e  4OH(aq)  +0.40 V which is possible in moist air.Silver and copper film over and oxidize easily and readily, thus the copper sheets with a patina of oxidation used in architectural designs and the resultant market for a myriad of silver polishing compounds. The film over of Silver is due to its high sensitivity to sulfide. Chemically patina is caused by an attack of oxygen in wet air and by CO2 afterward.(On the other hand, rhenium coated mirrors are said to be very durable,( despite the fact that rhenium and technetium are said to tarnish slowly in moist atmosphere.(R.

P/E_ratio
Image:SP500pe2.svg|370px|right|thumb|Shillers plot of the S&P Composite Real Ratio and Interest Rates (18712008), from Irrational Exuberance, 2d ed.() In the preface to this edition, Shiller warns that the stock market has not come down to historical levels: the price-earnings ratio as I define it in this book is still, at this writing 2005, in the mid-20s, far higher than the historical average. ... People still place too much confidence in the markets and have too strong a belief that paying attention to the gyrations in their investments will someday make them rich, and so they do not make conservative preparations for possible bad outcomes.The P/E ratio (price-to-earnings ratio) of a stock (also called its P/E, or simply multiple) is a measure of the price paid for a share relative to the annual income or profit earned by the firm per share.() The P/E ratio can therefore alternatively be calculated by dividing the companys capitalization by its total annual earnings.Unlike the EV/EBITDA multiple which is structure-neutral, the price-to-earnings ratio reflects the structure of the company in question. The price-to-earnings ratio is a ratio used for valuation: a higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying more for each unit of net income, so the stock is more expensive compared to one with a lower P/E ratio. The P/E ratio can be seen as being expressed in years, (Price is in currency or currency/share, while earnings are in currency/year, or currency/share/year.) in the sense that it shows the number of years of earnings which would be required to pay back purchase price, ignoring inflation and time value of money. The P/E ratio also shows current investor demand for a company share. The reciprocal of the P/E ratio is known as the yield.(for the Long Run, by Jeremy J. Siegel, McGraw-Hill Companies; 2nd edition (March 1, 1998) (Old edition) New edition is ) The earnings yield is an estimate of the expected return from holding the stock if we accept certain restrictive assumptions (a discussion of these assumptions can be found here).DefinitionThe P/E ratio is defined as::: \mbox{P/E ratio}\frac{\mbox{Market Price per Share}}{\mbox{Annual Earnings per Share}}However, the definition of its components may vary. The price per share in the numerator is the price of a single share of the stock. The per share in the denominator depends on the type of P/E:* Trailing P/E or P/E ttm: Here per share is the income of the company for the most recent 12 month period, divided by the number of shares issued. This is the most common meaning of P/E if no other qualifier is specified. Monthly earning data for individual companies are not available, so the previous four quarterly earnings reports are used and per share are updated quarterly. Note, each company chooses its own year so the timing of updates will vary from one to another.* Trailing P/E from continued operations: Instead of income, this uses earnings, which exclude earnings from discontinued operations, extraordinary items (e.g. one-off windfalls and write-downs), or accounting changes. Note, longer-term P/E data, such as Shillers, use net earnings.* Forward P/E, P/Ef, or estimated P/E: Instead of income, this uses estimated net earnings over next 12 months. Estimates are typically derived as the mean of a select group of analysts (note, selection criteria is rarely cited). In times of rapid economic dislocation, such estimates become less relevant as the situation changes (e.g. new economic data is published, and/or the basis of forecasts becomes obsolete) more quickly than analysts adjust their forecasts.For example, if stock A is trading at $24 and the earnings per share for the most recent 12 month period is $3, then stock A has a P/E ratio of 24/3 or 8. Put another way, the purchaser of the stock is paying $8 for every dollar of earnings. Companies with losses (negative earnings) or no profit have an undefined P/E ratio (usually shown as Not applicable or N/A); sometimes, however, a negative P/E ratio may be shown.By comparing price and earnings per share for a company, one can analyze the markets valuation of a company and its shares relative to the income the company is actually generating. Stocks with higher (and/or more certain) forecast growth will usually have a higher P/E, and those expected to have lower (and/or riskier) earnings growth will usually have a lower P/E. Investors can use the P/E ratio to compare the value of stocks: if one stock has a P/E twice that of another stock, all things being equal (especially the growth rate), it is a less attractive investment. Companies are rarely equal, however, and comparisons between industries, companies, and time periods may be misleading.P/E ratio in general is useful for comparing valuation of peer companies in similar sector or group. Since 1900, the average P/E ratio for the 500 index has ranged from  4.78 in Dec 1920 to 44.20 in Dec 1999,() with an average around 15.()  The average P/E of the market varies in relation with, among other factors, expected growth of earnings, expected stability of earnings, expected inflation, and yields of competing investments.  For example, when US treasury bonds yield high returns, investors pay less for a given per share and P/Es fall. Image:Price-Earnings Ratios as a Predictor of Twenty-Year Returns (Shiller Data).png|370px|right|thumb|Price-Earnings ratios as a predictor of twenty-year returns based upon the plot by Shiller (Figure 10.1,(  source). The horizontal axis shows the real price-earnings ratio of the S&P Composite Stock Price Index as computed in Irrational Exuberance (inflation adjusted price divided by the prior ten-year mean of inflation-adjusted earnings). The vertical axis shows the geometric average real annual return on investing in the S&P Composite Stock Price Index, reinvesting dividends, and selling twenty years later. Data from different twenty year periods is color-coded as shown in the key. See also ten-year returns. Shiller stated in 2005 that this plot confirms that long-term investorsinvestors who commit their money to an investment for ten full yearsdid do well when prices were low relative to earnings at the beginning of the ten years. Long-term investors would be well advised, individually, to lower their exposure to the stock market when it is high, as it has been recently, and get into the market when it is low.(Determining share pricesShare prices in a traded company are determined by market and demand, and thus depend upon the expectations of buyers and sellers. Among these are:* The companys future and recent performance, including potential growth;* Perceived risk, including risk due to high leverage;* Prospects for companies of this type, the sector.By dividing the price of one share in a company by the profits earned by the company per share, you arrive at the P/E ratio. If earnings per share move proportionally with share prices the ratio stays the same. But if stock prices gain in value and earnings remain the same or go down, the P/E rises. The earnings figure used is the most recently available, although this figure may be out of date and may not necessarily reflect the current position of the company. This is often referred to as a trailing P/E, because it involves taking earnings from the last four quarters.Other related measuresThe forward P/E uses the estimated earnings going forward twelve months. P/E10 uses average earnings for the past 10 years. There is a view that the average earnings for a 20 year period remains largely constant,() thus using P/E10 will reduce the noise in the data.The P/E ratio relates to the value. A similar measure can be defined for real estate, see index.ratio is obtained by dividing the P/E ratio by the annual earnings growth rate. It is considered a form of normalization because higher growth rate should cause higher P/E.The similar ratio on the value level is EV/EBITDA value divided by the EBITDA.Present Value of Growth Opportunities (PVGO) is another alternative method for stock valuation. Present value of growth opportunities is calculated by finding the difference between price of equity with constant growth and price of equity with no growth.: PVGO  P(Growth) - P(No growth)  D1/(r-g) - E/rwhere: D1  Dividend for next period: r   Cost of Capital or the capitalization rate of the company: E   Earning on equity: g   The growth rate of the company.Since the Price/Earnings (P/E) Multiple is Price per share / Earnings per share it can be written as: P0 / E1  1/r 1+ (PVGO/(E1/r)).Thus, as PVGO rises, the P/E ratio rises.Earnings yieldThe reverse (or reciprocal) of the P/E is the E/P, also known as the yield. The earnings yield is quoted as a percentage, and is useful in comparing a stock, sector, or the markets valuation relative to bonds.The earnings yield is also the cost to a publicly traded company of raising expansion capital through the issuance of stock.Its computed as (EARNINGS PER SHARE/MARKET PRICE PER SHARE)Price/dividend ratioPublicly traded companies often make periodic quarterly or yearly cash payments to their owners, the shareholders, in direct proportion to the number of shares held. According to US law, such payments can only be made out of current earnings or out of reserves (earnings retained from previous years). The company decides on the total payment and this is divided by the number of shares. The resulting dividend is an amount of cash per share.  Just as P/E is the ratio of price to earnings, the Price/Dividend ratio is the ratio of price to dividend.Dividend yieldThe yield is the dividend paid in the last accounting year divided by the current share price: it is the reciprocal of the Price/Dividend ratio.If a stock paid out $5 per share in cash dividends to its shareholders last year, and its price is currently $50, then it has a dividend yield of 10%.Historically, stocks with very high P/E ratios pay little if any dividends. Theoretically speaking, if the dividend exceeds the earnings, the company may be seen as returning capital to its investors, a situation that can not persist indefinitely.Relationship between measuresSeveral of these measures are related to each other: given price, earnings, and dividend, there are 6 possible ratios, which come in reciprocal pairs:* P/E ratio and earnings yield are reciprocals;* P/D ratio and dividend yield are reciprocals;* payout ratio (DPR)  Dividend/EPS, while the reciprocal is cover (DC)  EPS/Dividend.They are related by the following equations:* P/E  P/D * DPR and P/D  P/E * DC;* taking reciprocals, earnings yield  dividend yield * DC and dividend yield  earnings yield * DPR.InterpretationThe average U.S. equity P/E ratio from 1900 to 2005 is 14 (or 16, depending on whether the mean or the mean, respectively, is used to average). Normally, stocks with high earning growth are traded at higher P/E values. From the previous example, stock A, trading at $24 per share, may be expected to earn $6 per share the next year. Then the forward P/E ratio is $24/6  4. So, you are paying $4 for every one dollar of earnings, which makes the stock more attractive than it was the previous year.The P/E ratio implicitly incorporates the perceived risk of a given companys future earnings. For a stock purchaser, this risk includes the possibility of bankruptcy. For companies with high leverage (that is, high levels of debt), the risk of bankruptcy will be higher than for other companies. Assuming the effect of leverage is positive, the earnings for a highly-leveraged company will also be higher. In principle, the P/E ratio incorporates this information, and different P/E ratios may reflect the structure of the sheet.Variations on the standard trailing and forward P/E ratios are common. Generally, alternative P/E measures substitute different measures of earnings, such as rolling averages over longer periods of time (to smooth volatile earnings, for example),() or corrected earnings figures that exclude certain extraordinary events or one-off gains or losses. The definitions may not be standardized.Various interpretations of a particular P/E ratio are possible, and the historical table below is just indicative and cannot be a guide, as current P/E ratios should be compared to current interest rates (see model):It is usually not enough to look at the P/E ratio of one company and determine its status. Usually, an analyst will look at a companys P/E ratio compared to the industry the company is in, the sector the company is in, as well as the overall market (for example the 500 if it is listed in a US exchange). Sites such as Reuters offer these comparisons in one table. Example of SPY Often, comparisons will also be made between quarterly and annual data. Only after a comparison with the industry, sector, and market can an analyst determine whether a P/E ratio is high or low with the above mentioned distinctions (i.e., undervaluation, over valuation, fair valuation, etc).Using cash flow analysis, the impact of earnings growth and inflation can be evaluated. The on-line calculator at Moneychimp(P/E: Price to Earnings Ratio)allows one to evaluate the fair P/E ratio. Using constant historical growth rate of 3.8 and post-war 500 returns of 11% (including 4% inflation) as the discount rate, the fair P/E is obtained as 14.42. A stock growing at 10% for next 5 years would have a fair P/E of 18.65.The market P/ETo calculate the P/E ratio of a market index such as the S&P 500, it is not accurate to take the simple average of the P/Es of all stock constituents; since it is a index, the accurate method is to calculate a weighted average. In this case, each stocks underlying cap (price multiplied by number of shares in issue) is summed to give the total value in terms of market capitalization for the whole market index. The same method is computed for each stocks underlying earnings (earnings per share multiplied by number of shares in issue). In this case, the total of all net earnings is computed and this gives the total earnings for the whole market index. The final stage is to divide the total market capitalization by the total earnings to give the total market P/E ratio. The reason for using the weighted average method rather than simple average can best be described by the fact that the smaller constituents have less of an impact on the overall market index. For example, if a market index is composed of companies X and Y, both of which have the same P/E ratio (which causes the market index to have the same ratio as well) but X has a 9 times greater market cap than Y, then a percentage drop in earnings per share in Y should yield a much smaller effect in the market index than the same percentage drop in earnings per share in X.  One easy way of looking up a market index P/E ratio is to look up the P/E ratio of an ETF that tracks the index.  For example SPY tracks the 500 Index, while VTI tracks the 5000 index.  A variation that is often used is to exclude companies with negative earnings from the sample - especially when looking at sub-indices with a lower number of stocks where companies with negative earnings will distort the figures. In for the Long Run, Jeremy Siegel argues that the earnings yield is a good indicator of the market performance on the long run. The average P/E for the past 130 years has been 12.1 (i.e. earnings yield 8.3 percent).Inputs Accuracy and context In practice, decisions must be made as to how to exactly specify the inputs used in the calculations. * Does the current market price accurately value the organization? * How is income to be calculated and for what periods? How do we calculate total capitalization? * Can these values be trusted? * What are the revenue and earnings growth prospects over the time frame one is investing in? * Were there special one-time charges which artificially lowered (or artificially raised) the earnings used in the calculation, and did those charges cause a drop in stock price or were they ignored?  * Were these charges truly one-time, or is the company trying to manipulate us into thinking so?  * What kind of P/E ratios is the market giving to similar companies, and also the P/E ratio of the entire market?*Are P/E ratios an accurate measure? Historical vs. Projected Earnings A distinction has to be made between the fundamental (or intrinsic) P/E and the way we actually compute P/Es. The fundamental or intrinsic P/E examines earnings forecasts. That is what was done in the analogy above. In reality, we actually compute P/Es using the latest 12 month corporate earnings. Using past earnings introduces a temporal mismatch, but it is felt that having this mismatch is better than using future earnings, since future earnings estimates are notoriously inaccurate and susceptible to deliberate manipulation.On the other hand, just because a stock is trading at a low fundamental P/E is not an indicator that the stock is undervalued. A stock may be trading at a low P/E because the investors are less optimistic about the future earnings from the stock. Thus, one way to get a fair comparison between stocks is to use their primary P/E. This primary P/E is based on the earnings projections made for the next years to which a discount calculation is applied.The P/E ratio in business cultureThe P/E ratio of a company is a significant focus for management in many companies and industries. This is because management is primarily paid with their companys stock (a form of payment that is supposed to align the interests of management with the interests of other stock holders), in order to increase the stock price.   The stock price can increase in one of two ways: either through improved earnings or through an improved multiple that the market assigns to those earnings. As mentioned earlier, a higher P/E ratio is the result of a sustainable advantage that allows a company to grow earnings over time (i.e., investors are paying for their peace of mind). Efforts by management to convince investors that their companies do have a sustainable advantage have had profound effects on business:*The primary motivation for building conglomerates is to diversify earnings so that they go up steadily over time.*The choice of businesses which are enhanced or closed down or sold within these conglomerates is often made based on their perceived volatility, regardless of the absolute level of profits or profit margins.*One of the main genres of financial fraud, fund accounting (hiding excess earnings in good years to cover for losses in lean years), is designed to create the image that the company always slowly but steadily increases profits, with the goal to increase the P/E ratio. These and many other actions used by companies to structure themselves to be perceived as commanding a higher P/E ratio can seem counterintuitive to some, because while they may decrease the absolute level of profits they are designed to increase the stock price. Thus, in this situation, maximizing the stock price acts as a incentive.Recent historic valuesThere is no theoretically ideal P/E ratio for a company. For instance, the Investment Market in London comprises mining companies like Talvivaara with P/E ratio exceeding 99000 in late November 2008.Here are the recent year end values of the S&P 500 index and the associated P/E as reported.() For a list of recent contractions (recessions) and expansions see US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions.right|thumb|300pxNote that at the height of the bubble P/E had risen to 32. The collapse in earnings caused P/E to rise to 46.50 in 2001. It has declined to a more sustainable region of 17. Its decline in recent years has been due to higher growth.During 1920-1990, the P/E ratio was mostly between 10 and 20, except for some brief periods.(Is the P/E Ratio a Good Market-Timing Indicator?) Jeremy Siegel has suggested that the average P/E ratio of about 15 (or earnings yield of about 6.6%) arises due to the long term returns for stocks of about 6.8%.Jeremy Siegel in for the Long Run, (2002 edition) had argued that with the favorable developments like the lower capital gains tax rates and transaction costs, P/E ratio in low twenties is sustainable, although higher than the historic average.(NAREIT - Capital Markets)See also* yield* analysis* of finance topics* market* market bubble* market crash* valuation* investingNotesReferencesExternal links*How to Use the P/Epreu-beneficipomrda:Price/earningde:Kurs-Gewinn-Verhltnisja kasumi suhe(      )(finanzas)Earning Ratiogl:PERko:omjerprezzo-utilirodiklisverhoudingja:no:P/Epl:C/ZPreo/Lucro/ratiofi:P/E-lukusv:P/E /s P/Ezh-classical:zh:

Banking_in_the_United_States
Banking in the United States is regulated by both the federal and state governments.The U.S. banking sectors short-term liabilities as of October 11, 2008 are 15% of the domestic product (GDP) of the United States or 43% of its national debt, and the average bank leverage ratio (assets divided by net worth) is 12 to 1.()Regulatory agenciesregulation in the United States is highly fragmented compared with other G10countries, where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S., banking is regulated at both the federal and state level.  Depending on the type of charter a banking organization has and on its organizational structure, it may be subject to numerous federal and state banking regulations.  Unlike Japan and the United Kingdom (where regulatory authority over the banking, securities and insurance industries is combined into one single financial-service agency), the U.S. maintains separate securities, commodities, and insurance regulatory agenciesseparate from the bank regulatory agenciesat the federal and state level.()The U.S also has one of the most highly-regulated banking environments in the world, focusing on privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-usury lending and the promotion of lending to lower-income populations.  Some individual cities also enact their own regulation laws (for example, defining what constitutes usurious lending).Since the enactment of the Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1989 (FDICIA), all commercial banks that accept deposits are required to obtain FDIC insurance and to have a primary federal regulator (the Fed for state banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC for nonmember state banks, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for all National Banks).Federal credit unions are regulated by National Credit Union Administration (NCUA); Savings & Loan Associations (S&L) and Federal savings banks (FSB) are regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS).Federal Reserve systemThe banking system of the United States, called the Reserve system, was created in 1913 by the enactment of the Reserve Act,  largely in response to a series of financial panics, particularly a severe panic in 1907.()( Just before the founding of the Federal Reserve, the nation was plagued with financial crises. At times, these crises led to panics, in which people raced to their banks to withdraw their deposits. A particularly severe panic in 1907 resulted in bank runs that wreaked havoc on the fragile banking system and ultimately led Congress in 1913 to write the Federal Reserve Act. Initially created to address these banking panics, the Federal Reserve is now charged with a number of broader responsibilities, including fostering a sound banking system and a healthy economy.)()  Over time, the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System have expanded and its structure has evolved.(( It was founded by Congress in 1913 to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system. Over the years, its role in banking and the economy has expanded.)  Events such as the Depression were major factors leading to changes in the system.(Reform of the Federal Reserve System in the Early 1930s: The Politics of Money and Banking, by Sue C. Patrick, Garland, 1993.)  Its duties today, according to official Federal Reserve documentation, are to conduct the nations monetary policy, supervise and regulate banking institutions, maintain the stability of the financial system and provide financial services to institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions.(FRB: Mission)The Federal Reserve Systems structure is composed of the presidentially appointed Board of Governors (or Federal Reserve Board), the Open Market Committee (FOMC), twelve regional Reserve Banks located in major cities throughout the nation, numerous privately owned U.S. member banks and various advisory councils.( (Seestructure))(Federal Reserve Online)(Advisory Councils http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/advisorydefault.htm) The FOMC is the committee responsible for setting monetary policy and consists of all seven members of the Board of Governors and the twelve regional bank presidents, though only five bank presidents vote at any given time. The responsibilities of the central bank are divided into several separate and independent parts, some private and some public. The result is a structure that is considered unique among central banks. It is also unusual in that an entity outside of the central bank, namely the States Department of the Treasury, creates the currency used.()According to the Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve is independent within government in that its decisions do not have to be ratified by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branch of government.  However, its authority is derived from the Congress and is subject to congressional oversight.  Additionally, the members of the Board of Governors, including its chairman and vice-chairman, are chosen by the President and confirmed by Congress. The government also exercises some control over the Federal Reserve by appointing and setting the salaries of the systems highest-level employees. Thus the Federal Reserve has both private and public aspects.(Federal Reserve website http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqfrs.htm#5)()()() The U.S. Government receives all of the systems annual profits, after a statutory dividend of 6% on member banks capital investment is paid, and an account surplus is maintained. In 2010, the Federal Reserve made a profit of $82 billion and transferred $79 billion to the Treasury.()Federal Deposit Insurance CorporationThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a United States government corporation created by the Act of 1933. It provides insurance, which guarantees the safety of deposits in member banks, up to $250,000 per depositor per bank. , the FDIC insures deposits at 7,723 institutions.() The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages banks in receiverships (failed banks).Since the start of FDIC insurance on January 1, 1934, no depositor has lost any insured funds as a result of a bank failure.()Office of the Comptroller of the CurrencyThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is a U.S. federal agency established by the Currency Act of 1863 and serves to charter, regulate, and supervise all banks and the federal branches and agencies of foreign banks in the States. The acting Comptroller of the Currency is John Walsh.Office of Thrift SupervisionThe Office of Thrift Supervision is a United States federal agency under the Department of the Treasury. It was created in 1989 as a renamed version of another federal agency (that was faulted for its role in the and loan crisis). Like other U.S. federal bank regulators, it is paid by the banks it regulates.Active banks of the United StatesA list of many commercial banks in the United States can be found at the website of the FDIC.(http://www4.fdic.gov/IDASP/index.asp  Cookies must be enabled to use this interactive website.

According to the FDIC, there were 8,430 FDIC-insured commercial banks in the United States as of August 22, 2008.  Every member of the Reserve System is listed here along with non-members who are also insured by the FDIC.  This list does not include banks and investments that are not FDIC-insured.Bank mergers and closuresmergers happen for many reasons in normal business, for example, to create a single larger bank in which operations of both banks can be streamlined; to acquire another banks brands; or due to regulators closing the institution due to unsafe and unsound business practices or inadequate capitalization and liquidity.Banks are not allowed to go bankrupt in the United States. Accounts are insured up to $250,000 as of Oct 2008 per individual per bank by the FDIC.  Banks that are in danger of failing are either taken over by the FDIC, administered temporarily and eventually sold off or merged with other banks. A list of banks seized by regulators and the assuming institutions can be obtained at Federal Deposit Insurance Corp - Failed Bank list.HistoryAntebellum historyIn the first half of the 19th century, many of the smaller commercial banks within New England were easily chartered as laws allowed to do so (primarily due to open franchise laws). The rise of banking saw an increase in opportunities for wealthy individuals to become involved in entrepreneurial projects they would not involve themselves in without someone to guarantee a return on their investment. These early banks acted as intermediaries for entrepreneurs who did not have enough wealth to fund their own investment projects and for those who did have wealth but did not want to bear the risk of investing in projects. Thus, this private banking sector witnessed an array of insider lending, due primarily to low bank leverage and an information quality correlation, but many of these banks actually spurred early investment and helped spur many later projects. Despite what some may consider discriminatory practices with insider lending, these banks actually were very sound and failures remained uncommon, further encouraging the financial evolution in the United States.Early attempts to create a national bankIn 1781, an act of the of the Confederation established the of North Americain Philadelphia, where it superseded the state-chartered of Pennsylvania founded in 1780 to help fund the Revolutionary War. The Bank of North America was granted a monopoly on the issue of bills of credit as currency at the national level. Prior to the ratification of the of Confederation & Perpetual Union, only the States had sovereign power to charter a bank authorized to issue their own bills of credit. Afterwards, Congress also had that power.Robert Morris, the first Superintendent of Finance appointed under the Articles of Confederation, proposed the Bank of North America as a bank that would act as the sole fiscal and monetary agent for the government. He has accordingly been called the father of the system of credit, and paper circulation, in the United States.() He saw a national, for-profit, private monopoly following in the footsteps of the Bank of England as necessary, because previous attempts to finance the Revolutionary War, such as currency issued by the Congress, had led to depreciation of such an extent that Hamilton considered them to be public embarrassments.  After the war, a number of state banks were chartered, including in 1784: the of New York and the of Massachusetts.In 1791, Congress chartered the Bank of the United States to succeed the Bank of North America under One of the United States Constitution, Section 8. However, Congress failed to renew the charter for the Bank of the United States, which expired in 1811.  Similarly, the Bank of the United States was chartered in 1816 and shuttered in 1836.Jacksonian EraThe Bank of the United States opened in January 1817, six years after the Bank of the United States lost its charter.  The predominant reason that the Second Bank of the United States was chartered was that in the of 1812, the U.S. experienced severe inflation and had difficulty in financing military operations.  Subsequently, the credit and borrowing status of the United States was at its lowest level since its founding.The charter of the Second Bank of the United States (BUS) was for 20 years and therefore up for renewal in 1836. Its role as the depository of the federal governments revenues made it a political target of banks chartered by the individual states who objected/envied the B.U.S.s relationship with the central government.  Partisan politics came heavily into play in the debate over the renewal of the charter.  President Jackson strongly opposed the renewal of its charter, and built his platform for the election of 1832 around doing away with the Second Bank of the United States.Apart from a general hostility to banking and the belief that specie (gold and/or silver) were the only true money, Jacksons reasons for opposing the renewal of the charter revolved around his belief that bestowing power and responsibility upon a single bank was the cause of inflation and other perceived evils.During September 1833, President Jackson issued an executive order that ended the deposit of government funds into the Bank of the United States. After September 1833, these deposits were placed in the state chartered banks.18371863: Free Banking EraPrior to 1838 a bank charter could be obtained only by a specific legislative act, but in that year New York adopted the Free Banking Act, which permitted anyone to engage in banking, upon compliance with certain charter conditions. The Act (1837) allowed the automatic chartering of banks that would fulfill its requirements without special consent of the state legislature. These banks could issue bank notes against specie (gold and silver coins) and the states regulated the requirements, rates for loans and deposits, the necessary ratio etc. Free banking spread rapidly to other states, and from 1840 to 1863 all banking business was done by state-chartered institutions.()Numerous banks that were started during this period ultimately proved to be unstable.() In many Western states, the banking industry degenerated into wildcat banking because of the laxity and abuse of state laws. Bank notes were issued against little or no security, and credit was overexpanded; depressions brought waves of bank failures. In particular, the multiplicity of state bank notes caused great confusion and loss. The real value of a bank bill was often lower than its face value, and the issuing banks financial strength generally determined the size of the discount.National Bank ActTo correct such conditions, Congress passed (1863) the National Bank Act, which provided for a system of banks to be chartered by the federal government.  The National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864 were two United States federal laws that established a system of national charters for banks, and created the United States National Banking System. They encouraged development of a national currency backed by bank holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and established the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as part of the Department of the Treasury and authorized the Comptroller to examine and regulate nationally-chartered banks.Congress passed the National Bank Act in an attempt to retire the greenbacks that it had issued to finance the Norths effort in the Civil War.(http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res9D07EEDE133EE63BBC4153DFB3668382669FDE No Peace with Greenbacks, New York Times, May 9, 1879.)  This opened up an option for chartering banks nationally.  As an additional incentive for banks to submit to Federal supervision, in 1865 Congress began taxing any of state bank notes (also called bills of credit or scrip) a standard rate of 10%, which encouraged many state banks to become national ones.  This tax also gave rise to another response by state banksthe widespread adoption of the deposit account, also known as a checking account. By the 1880s, deposit accounts had changed the primary source of revenue for many banks.  The result of these events is what is known as the dual banking system.  New banks may choose either state or national charters (a bank also can convert its charter from one to the other).Rise of investment banksCivil WarDuring the Civil War, banking houses were syndicated to meet the federal governments need for money to fund its war efforts.  Cooke launched the first mass securities selling operation in U.S. history employing thousands of salesmen to float what ultimately amounted to $830 million worth of government bonds to a wide group of investors.(Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer, Jay Cooke: financier of the Civil War (1907) Volume 1 - Page 299  online edition) Cooke then reached out to the general public, acting as an agent of the Treasury Department, personally led a war bond drive that netted approximately $1.5 billion for Treasury.()()Surging demand for capital in the Gilded AgeThe rise of the commercial banking sector coincided with the growth of early factories, since entrepreneurs had to rely on commercial banks in order to fund their own projects. Because of this need for capital, many banks began to arise by the late 19th century. By 1880, New England became one of the most heavily banked areas in the world.(N. Lamoreaux, The Great Merge Movement in American Business, 1895-1904 (Cambridge, 1985))Lance Davis has demonstrated that the process of capital formation in the nineteenth century was markedly different between the British capital market and the American capital market.  British industrialists were readily able to satisfy their need for capital by tapping a vast source of international capital through British banks such as Westminsters, Lloyds and Barclays.  In contrast, the dramatic growth of the United States created capital requirements that far outstripped the limited capital resources of American banks.  Investment banking in the United States emerged to serve the expansion of railroads, mining companies, and heavy industry. Unlike commercial banks, investment banks were not authorized to issue notes or accept deposits.  Instead, they served as brokers or intermediaries, bringing together investors with capital and the firms that needed that capital.()()Bimetallism and the gold standardToward the end of the nineteenth century, bimetallism became a center of political conflict During the civil war, to finance the war the U.S. switched from bimetallism to a flat greenback currency. In 1873, the government passed the Fourth Coinage Act and soon resumption to specie payments began without the free and unlimited coinage of silver. This put the U.S. on a mono-metallic gold standard.(http://hoohila.stanford.edu/workingpapers/getWorkingPaper.php?filenameE-89-12.pdf)Early 20th centuryDuring the period from 18901925, the investment banking industry was highly concentrated and dominated by an oligopoly that consisted of JP Morgan & Co.; Kuhn, Loeb & Co.; Brown Brothers; and Kidder, Peabody & Co.  There was no legal requirement to separate the operations of commercial and investment banks; as a result deposits from the commercial banking side of the business constituted an in-house supply of capital that could be used to fund the underwriting business of the investment banking side.()The Panic of 1907 and the Pujo CommitteeIn 1913, the Pujo Committee unanimously determined that a small cabal of financiers had gained consolidated control of numerous industries through the abuse of the public trust in the United States. The chair of the House Committee on Banking and Currency, Representative Pujo, (DLa. 7th) convened a special committee to investigate a money trust, the de facto monopoly of Morgan and New Yorks other most powerful bankers. The committee issued a scathing report on the banking trade that concluded that a community of influential financial leaders had gained control of major manufacturing, transportation, mining, telecommunications and financial markets of the United States. The report revealed that no less than eighteen different major financial corporations were under control of a cartel led by J.P Morgan, George F Baker and James Stillman. These three men, through the resources of seven banks and trust companies (Bankers Trust Co., Guaranty Trust Co., Astor Trust Co., National Bank of Commerce, Liberty National Bank, Chase National Bank, Farmers Loan and Trust Co.) controlled an estimated $2.1 billion.  The report revealed that a handful of men held manipulative control of the New York Stock Exchange and attempted to evade interstate commerce laws.The findings of the committee inspired public support for ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913, passage of the Reserve Act that same year, and passage of the Antitrust Act in 1914.The Federal Reserve SystemThe of 1907 was headed off by a private conglomerate, who set themselves up as lenders of last resort to banks in trouble. This effort succeeded in stopping the panic, and led to calls for a Federal agency to do the same thing.  In response, the Federal Reserve System was created by the Reserve Act of 1913, establishing a new central bank intended serve as a formal lender of last resort to banks in times of liquidity crisispanics where depositors tried to withdraw their money faster than a bank could pay it out.The legislation provided for a system that included a number of regional Federal Reserve Banks and a seven-member governing board. All national banks were required to join the system and other banks could join.  Congress created Federal Reserve notes to provide the nation with an elastic supply of currency. The notes were to be issued to Federal Reserve Banks for subsequent transmittal to banking institutions in accordance with the needs of the public.The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 established the present day Federal Reserve System and brought all banks in the United States under the authority of the Federal Reserve (a quasi-governmental entity), creating the twelve regional Reserve Banks which are supervised by the Reserve Board.McFadden ActThe McFadden Act was enacted in 1927 based on recommendations made by the Comptroller of Currency May Dawes.  The Act sought to give national banks competitive equality with state-chartered banks by letting national banks branch to the extent permitted by state law. The McFadden Act specifically prohibited interstate branching by allowing each national bank to branch only within the state in which it is situated. Although the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994() repealed this provision of the McFadden Act, it specified that state law continues to control intrastate branching, or branching within a states borders, for both state and national banks.Credit unionsCredit unions originated in Europe in the mid-19th century. The first credit union in the United States was established in 1908 in New Hampshire. At the time, banks were unwilling to lend to many poor laborers, who then turned to corrupt moneylenders and sharks.(Teresed, Swen. Dictated But ---- Not Read. The Deseret News. 14 Dec. 1937.) Businessman and philanthropist Filene spearheaded an effort to secure legislation for credit unions first in Massachusetts and later throughout the United States. With the help of the Union National Extension Bureau and an army of volunteers, states began passing credit union legislation in the 1920s. Credit unions were formed based on a of association, often beginning with a small group of employees. Despite opposition from the banking industry, the Credit Union Act was signed into law in 1934 as part of the Deal, allowing the creation of federally chartered credit unions in the United States. The Union National Association (CUNA) was formed and by 1937, 6400 credit unions with 1.5 million members were active in 45 states.(Credit Union Head Tells of Expansion. The Deseret News. 14 Dec. 1937.) Today there are over 9500 credit unions in the United States and they are regulated by the Credit Union Administration(NCUA).(NCUA. Credit Union Administration.)Savings and loan associationsThe savings and loan association became a strong force in the early 20th century through assisting people with home ownership, through mortgage lending, and further assisting their members with basic saving and investing outlets, typically through passbook savings accounts and term certificates of deposit.The U.S. Congress passed the Home Loan Bank Act in 1932, during the Depression. It established the Home Loan Bank and associated Home Loan Bank Board to assist other banks in providing funding to offer long term, amortizedloans for home purchases.  The idea was to get banks involved in lending, not insurance companies, and to provide realistic loans which people could repay and gain full ownership of their homes.Savings and loan associations sprang up all across the United States because there was low-cost funding available through the Federal Home Loan Bank for the purposes of mortgage lending.New Deal-era reformsDuring the 1930s, the U.S. and the rest of the world experienced a severe economic contraction that is now called the Depression.  In the U.S. during the height of the Great Depression, the official unemployment rate was 25% and the stock market had declined 75% since 1929.  runs were common because there wasnt insurance on deposits at banks, banks kept only a fraction of deposits in reserve, and customers ran the risk of losing the money that they had deposited if their bank failed.(http://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/learning/when/1930s.html)By the beginning of 1933, the banking system in the United States had effectively ceased to function.  The incoming Roosevelt administration and the incoming Congress took immediate steps to pass legislation to respond to the Great Depression.Roosevelt entered office with enormous capital. Americans of all political persuasions were demanding immediate action, and Roosevelt responded with a remarkable series of new programs in the first hundred days of the administration, in which he met with Congress for 100 days. During those 100 days of lawmaking, Congress granted every request Roosevelt asked, and passed a few programs (such as the FDIC to insure bank accounts) that he opposed.A major component of Roosevelts New Deal was reform of the nations banking system.  With strident language Roosevelt took credit for dethroning the bankers he alleged had caused the debacle.(Ronnie J. Phillips,The Chicago plan and New Deal banking reform (1995) 37)}}Emergency Banking ActRoosevelt closed all the banks in the country and kept them all closed until he could pass new legislation.() On March 9, Roosevelt sent to Congress the Banking Act, drafted in large part by Hoovers top advisors. The act was passed and signed into law the same day. It provided for a system of reopening sound banks under Treasury Department supervision, with federal loans available if needed. Three-quarters of the banks in the Federal Reserve System reopened within the next three days. Billions of dollars in hoarded currency and gold flowed back into them within a month, thus stabilizing the banking system. By the end of 1933, 4,004 small local banks were permanently closed and merged into larger banks. (Their depositors eventually received on average 86 cents on the dollar of their deposits; it is a common false myth that they received nothing back.)Creation of the FDIC and FSLICIn June 1933, over Roosevelts objections, Congress created the Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which insured deposits for up to $2,500 beginning January 1, 1934.  On June 16, 1933, President D. Roosevelt signed the Banking Act of 1933.  This legislation:(* Established the FDIC as a temporary government corporation* Gave the FDIC authority to provide deposit insurance to banks* Gave the FDIC the authority to regulate and supervise state nonmember banks* Funded the FDIC with initial loans of $289 million through the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve* Extended federal oversight to all commercial banks for the first time* Separated commercial and investment banking (GlassSteagall Act)* Prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts* Allowed national banks to branch statewide, if allowed by state law.The FSLIC was created as part of the Housing Act of 1934 in order to insure deposits in savings and loans, a year after the FDIC was created to insure deposits in commercial banks.  It was administered by the Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB).()Abandonment of the gold standardTo deal with deflation, the nation went off the gold standard. In March and April in a series of laws and executive orders, the government suspended the standard for United States currency.(Under the gold standard, the Federal Reserve was prevented from lowering interest rates and was instead forced to raise rates to protect the dollar.) Anyone holding significant amounts of gold coinage was mandated to exchange it for the existing fixed price of US dollars, after which the US would no longer pay gold on demand for the dollar, and gold would no longer be considered valid tender for debts in private and public contracts. The dollar was allowed to float freely on exchange markets with no guaranteed price in gold, only to be fixed again at a significantly lower level a year later with the passage of the Reserve Act in 1934. Markets immediately responded well to the suspension, in the hope that the decline in prices would finally end.()Glass-Steagall Act of 1933The Act of 1933 was passed in reaction to the collapse of a large portion of the American commercial banking system in early 1933.  One of its provisions introduced the separation of bank types according to their business (commercial and banking).   In order to comply with the new regulation, most large banks split into separate entities. For example, JP Morgan split into three entities: JP Morgan continued to operate as a commercial bank, Morgan Stanley was formed to operate as an investment bank, and Morgan Grenfell operated as a British merchant bank.()Banking Act of 1935The Banking Act of 1935 strengthened the powers of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in the area of credit management, tightened existing restrictions on banks engaging in certain activities, and enlarged the supervisory powers of the FDIC.Bretton Woods systemThe Bretton Woods system of monetary management established the rules for commercial and financial relations among the worlds major industrial states in the mid-20th century. The Bretton Woods system was the first example of a fully negotiated monetary order intended to govern monetary relations among independent nation-states.Setting up a system of rules, institutions, and procedures to regulate the international monetary system, the planners at Bretton Woods established the Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which today is part of the Bank Group.  The chief features of the Bretton Woods system were an obligation for each country to adopt a policy that maintained the rate by tying its currency to the U.S. dollar and the ability of the IMF to bridge temporary imbalances of payments.Automated teller machinesOn September 2, 1969, Bank installed the first ATM in the U.S. at its branch in Centre, New York.  The first ATMs were designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a specially coded card.()  A Chemical Bank advertisement boasted On Sept. 2 our bank will open at 9:00 and never close again.()Nixon shockIn 1971, President Nixon took a series of economic measures that collectively are known as the Shock.  These measures included unilaterally cancelling the direct convertibility of the States dollar to gold that essentially ended the existing Bretton Woods system of international financial exchange.Deregulation of the 1980s and 1990sLegislation passed by the federal government during the 1980s, such as the Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 and the Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, diminished the distinctions between banks and other financial institutions in the United States.  This legislation is frequently referred to as deregulation, and it is often blamed for the failure of over 500 and loan associations between 1980 and 1988, and the subsequent failure of the Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) whose obligations were assumed by the Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1989.  However, some critics of this viewpoint, particularly libertarians, have pointed out that the federal governments attempts at deregulation granted easy credit to federally insured financial institutions, encouraging them to overextend themselves and (thus) fail.Savings and loan crisisThe savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s was the failure of 747 out of the 3,234 and loan associations in the United States. As of December 31, 1995, RTC estimated that the total cost for resolving the 747 failed institutions was $87.9 billion. The remainder of the bailout was paid for by charges on savings and loan accounts()which contributed to the large deficits of the early 1990s.The concomitant slowdown in the finance industry and the real estate market may have been a contributing cause of the 19901991 economic recession. Between 1986 and 1991, the number of new homes constructed per year dropped from 1.8 million to 1 million, which was at the time the lowest rate since War II.()Expansion of FDIC insurance - 1989Until 1989, national banks (those with national charters) were required to participate in the FDIC, while state banks either were required to obtain FDIC insurance by state law or they could voluntarily join it (usually in an attempt to bolster their appearance of solvency).  After enactment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1989 (FDICIA), all commercial banks that accepted deposits were required to obtain FDIC insurance and to have a primary federal regulator (the Fed for state banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC for nonmember state banks, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for all National Banks).Note: Federal credit unions are regulated by National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Savings & Loan Associations (S&L) and Federal savings banks (FSB) are regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS)Interstate bankingThe Reigle-Neale Interstate Banking and Branching Act of 1994.()Repeal of the Glass-Steagall ActProvisions of the Glass-Steagall Act that prohibit a holding company from owning other financial companies were repealed on November 12, 1999, by the Act.()()The repeal of the GlassSteagall Act of 1933 effectively removed the separation that previously existed between Wall Street investment banks and depository banks. This repeal directly contributed to the severity of the crisis of 20072010.(Kos: Banking Deregulation and Clinton)(What Was The Glass-Steagall Act?)(Sold Out: How Wall Street and WashingtonBetrayed America, March 2009, Consumer Education Foundation>www.wallstreetwatch.org)(Clinton repeal of Glass-Steagall faulty as seen today March 17th, 2008,http://mortgageblues.us/news/398)(The Repeal of Glass-Steagallhttp://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/03/repeal-glass-steagall)Late-2000s financial crisisThe late-2000s financial crisis is considered by many economists to be the worst crisis since the Depression of the 1930s.(Three top economists agree 2009 worst financial crisis since great depression; risks increase if right steps are not taken. (February 29, 2009). Reuters. Retrieved 2009-09-30, from Business Wire News database.)

Guisborough
Guisborough  is a town and civil parish within the authority of and Cleveland and the ceremonial county of Yorkshire, England.The civil parish of Guisborough has a population of 18,108 and includes the outlying villages of Upleatham, Dunsdale, and under Roseberry as well as Guisborough itself.HistoryFor the last couple of centuries, Guisborough was part of the Riding of Yorkshire, from 1974 to 1996 part of the County of Cleveland and, at present, one of the major towns of the authority of and Cleveland. Gighesbore is listed in the Book(Domesday online.) and the ruined Priory dates back to the 12th century.  The priory  and Hall (16th century, demolished and rebuilt) are spelt without the first U. Some other old sites and names use that same spelling.Some theories date the town back to the Roman occupation of Britain, where it may have been a military fortification. There are a few Roman artifacts from the area that support this, such as an elaborate ceremonial helmet, the Helmet, but the theory remains unproven.Extensive residential development occurred during the 1960s and 1970s with the expansion of the chemical industry (at Wilton) and the steel industry (at Redcar).Guisborough market, held every Thursday and Saturday with a few stalls attending on a Tuesday, has long been a focal point of the surrounding area. Originally selling cows and other livestock, the market has gradually developed into a hubbub of fruit and vegetable, clothes and flower stalls. The market is open from early morning to late afternoon on the recently restored cobbles that line Westgate, the principal shopping street.Guisborough Museum, located behind Westgates Sunnyfield House, regularly exhibits photos of Guisboroughs history and inhabitants. There is a working watermill at nearby Mill.Guisborough HelmetThe Helmet is a Roman cavalry helmet found in 1864 near the town. It was originally fitted with a pair of protective cheek-pieces, which have not survived; the holes by which they were attached can be seen in front of the helmets ear guards. It is lavishly decorated with engraved and embossed figures, indicating that it was probably used for displays or cavalry tournaments, though it may well have been intended to be worn in battle as well. The helmet was found in what appears to have been a carefully arranged deposition in a bed of gravel, distant from any known Roman sites. After it was recovered during road works it was donated to the Museum in London, where it was restored and is currently on display.(British Museum collection database. Accessed 17 November 2010.)Saint Nicholas ChurchNicholas Anglican Church(Guisborough Parish Church) is home to the de Brus cenotaph. The church was possibly in existence in 1290, although the present chancel dates from the late 15th century. The present nave and interior have been greatly altered since then; the church, in its present form, is the result of a major re-building (190308), to a design by the architect Temple Moore.Gisborough HallHall, the Victorian mansion, was built in the Jacobean style, in 1856. It is the former home of the family of Lord Gisborough, the estate having been in the hands of the Chaloner family from just after the dissolution of Gisborough Priory until the 1940s. It is a II listed building and serves as a hotel, as part of the Hotels chain;(Gisborough Hall Hotel) it is a popular venue for wedding receptions.Industrial RevolutionThe town shared in the prosperity of the industrial revolution through its proximity to the ironstone mines of the North Yorkshire Moors.  One of Teessides leading ironfounders, Sir Whitwell Pease, chose Guisborough as the site of his country seat, the Alfred Waterhouse-designed Gothic revival Hutton Hall, situated at Hutton Lowcross. This house had its own station on the erstwhile Middlesbrough-Guisborough branch of the North Eastern Railway (closed in 1964).EducationThe town is well served with primary schools, namely Belmont, Galley Hill, Highcliffe, St. Paulinus (R.C.) and Chaloner Primary, which was formed from the amalgamation of the former Northgate Junior and Park Lane schools. Laurence Jackson School,(Laurence Jackson School) at the eastern end of the town, is the only school and a Sports College; it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008.Pursglove College is a form college in Guisborough teaching GCSE, A level and AS level students. The college is next door to St Nicholas Parish Church and the ruins of Priory. It is situated on the former site of Guisborough School, which it replaced as a result of restructuring. The Grammar School was originally founded by Robert Pursglove, Prior of Gisborough Priory, as a charitable school for poor boys.Between October 2008 and June 2009, Askham Bryan College of Agriculture opened its Guisborough Centre, located on the same site as Prior Pursglove College.(http://www.askham-bryan.ac.uk/about_the_college/centres/guisborough_centre) This consists of an animal management centre and a modern building, the Priory Centre, which is shared with Prior Pursglove College.(http://www.pursglove.ac.uk//index.php?optioncom_content&taskview&id332&Itemid40)AccessTwo main roads cross at Guisborough, the A171 and the A173.  The A171 leads west to Middlesbrough and east to Whitby whilst the A173 goes south-west to Stokesley and north-east as far as Skelton where it joins the A174 coast road.  Before the bypass was built, traffic on both of these had to pass through Westgate, the towns main street.  Just outside the bypass to the north-east, a B-road heads north from the A173 to Redcar.  Another minor route out of the town, Wilton Lane, is a very windy almost single-track which leads north to the small village of Wilton, whence one can either join the A174 or continue onto the ICI Wilton chemical works. As well as these, there are two lanes that lead out of town into the hills; Hutton Lane which ends at Village, a tiny settlement built mostly for local mining, agricultural and estate workers, and Belmangate, an ancient funeral route.Until 1964, Guisborough was also served by trains from Middlesbrough; the & Guisborough Railway had its terminus at the now-vanished Guisborough station. Prior to 1958 it was even possible to travel all the way to Whitby and Scarborough along the highly scenic North Yorkshire coast railway.For those travelling on foot, the south of the town is bounded by the York Moors National Park.  Guisborough Forest, which is Commission land, clothes the edge of the moors. Through the forest, the ground rises sharply, climbing from the plain below to the height of the moors behind. There are several rocky outcrops on this steep slope, including Highcliff Nab and the Hanging Stone.  The woods are crossed by several rights-of-way, including the Way, though other paths and commission tracks are considered fair game for walkers.  Beyond the woods, the ground levels out to form Gisborough Moor.EconomyThe two main employers in the town used to be The Shirt Factory - towards the end of its working life this clothing factory was acquired by Burton of Leeds - and the Hutton steel works.There are no longer any large employers in the town: Guisborough has become a town for nearby Middlesbrough, with many people working in the plants that are located around Teesside.Branch of the Corporation open in Guisborough, as a Manufacturing Site,() making the claws and buckets of Ground Engaging Tools, such as diggers.On 15 January 2004, Guisborough was granted Town status.Sports and recreationGuisborough has a King Georges Field in memory of King George V, and the towns football team Guisborough Town FC plays on the King George V Ground, adjacent to the playing fields. There is also a swimming pool dating from 1968 located within the grounds. An eight-year campaign led by the late MP Dr Ashok Kumar secured an extensive refurbishment of the pool, which was completed between 2008-09.( Middlesbrough Evening Gazette - Guisborough Swimming Pool Reopens 2 February 2009) The Rugby Union Football club play in Durham/Northumberland II Division of the Northern Section of the leagues. Guisborough Cricket Club who play in the North Yorkshire South Durham Premier league in 2001 - 2004 won the league to equal the record of four successive league wins in a row. Guisborough have also had professionals such as Murray Goodwin, (Sussex and former Zimbabwe international) Desmond Haynes and Phil Simmons (both West Indian internationals), Imran Jan (Trinidad and Tobago), Sean Clingeleffer (Tasmania) and Greg Todd (Otago).Notable people*Alan Stewart, Motorcyle racer who won the 350cc British championship 1977(Olivers Mount website: Rider Statistics for Alan Stewart (Guisborough)) *Champion, jockey who won the 1981 National, despite having recently been diagnosed with cancer*Gregan, footballer*Lewin, actor*Liddle, former BBC news editor*Scott, former newsreader and Clothes Show presenter.

River_Don,_South_Yorkshire
 watershed       The River Don (also called Dun in some stretches) is a river in Yorkshire, England. It rises in the Pennines and flows for  eastwards, through the Don Valley, via Penistone, Sheffield, Rotherham, Mexborough, Conisbrough, Doncaster and Stainforth. It originally joined the Trent, but was re-engineered by Vermuyden as the Dutch River in the 1620s, and now joins the River Ouse at Goole in the Riding of Yorkshire.  Don Valley is the local UK parliamentary constituency near the Doncaster stretch of the river.The Don can be divided into sections by the different types of structures built to restrict its passage. The upper reaches, and those of several of its tributaries, are defined by dams built to provide a public water supply. The middle section contains many weirs, which were built to supply mills, foundries and cutlers wheels with water power, while the lower section contains weirs and locks, designed to maintain water levels for navigation.The Dons major tributaries are the Loxley, the Rivelin, the Sheaf, the Rother and the Dearne.Along the SheffieldRotherham stretch of the river are five weirs that punctuate a local walking and cycling route, the Weirs Walk. A further walk, the Don Walk, is being developed that will make it possible to walk or cycle from Sheffield city centre up to Oughtibridge.The Don derives its name from Dn (or Danu), a Celtic mother goddess. The river gave its name to the Don River, one of the principal rivers of Toronto, Canada.HistoryBelow Doncaster, the main channel of the lower Don originally meandered in a north-easterly direction across the marshland of Chase to enter the Trent just above its junction with the Ouse. A second channel flowed to the north, along a Roman channel called Turnbridgedike.(Skempton (2002), pp.740-742) The eastern channel formed the boundary between Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.In the Hatfield Level drainage project which started in 1626, the Dutch civil engineer Vermuyden diverted the Don northwards along Turnbridgedike. He constructed Dikesmarsh bank some distance to the east of the channel, so that the intervening land could be used as washlands. The main work was completed by 1628, but after flooding in 1629, a Great Sluice was constructed at the junction between the river and the Aire, with 17 openings which were , probably by Hugo Spiering, who had assisted Vermuyden on the main project. The washlands had insufficient capacity, and in 1632 work started on a new channel, which would run for  from Newbridge, near Thorne, eastwards to enter the Ouse at the site of Goole,  upstream of the Trent. Water levels here were between  lower than at Turnbridge. This new channel was called the Dutch River, and was finished in 1635, at a cost of 33,000. It ended in a sluice at Goole, and was never intended to be navigable, as boats could access the Aire at Turnbridge.( The sluice was later swept away in a flood and never replaced.(Hatfield Chase Corporation, 1538-1973 - Water Resources - Manuscripts & Special Collections - The University of Nottingham, accessed 2010-05-02)The Dutch River was difficult to navigate, made more hazardous by shoals, three awkward bridges, and low water levels at neap tides. With the opening of the and Keadby Canal in 1802, from the Don at Stainforth to the Trent at Keadby, most traffic for the Trent used that in preference to the Dutch River and the route around Trent Falls, where the Trent joins the Humber.(Hadfield (1973), pp.293-294) Construction of a railway from Doncaster to Goole in 1869 reduced traffic on the river, but the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company was formed in 1889, to buy back the River Don Navigation, the Sheffield Canal and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal from railway ownership, in order to keep them competitive. They acquired the waterways in 1895, but failed to raise sufficient capital for the major improvements they had planned. However, they succeeded in constructing the Junction Canal from Stainforth to the Aire and Calder Navigation (Knottingley and Goole Canal) west of Goole, which was jointly funded by the Aire and Calder, and opened in 1905. The Dutch River reverted almost entirely to its original drainage function, and Stainforth lock, which connected it to the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, was closed in 1939.(Hadfield (1973), pp.410-426)NavigationNavigation to Sheffield was made possible by the construction of weirs, locks and canal cuttings to avoid circuitous and unnavigable sections of the Don downstream of Tinsley, and then by a canal from Tinsley to Sheffield. The first serious attempts at improvements were authorised by an of Parliament obtained in 1726 by Sheffields Company of Cutlers to make the river navigable from Holmstile in Doncaster to Tinsley, on the edge of Sheffield, and another obtained by the Corporation of Doncaster in 1727 to improve the river below Holmstile, as far as Wilsick House in Barnby Dun. An Act of 1733 created The Company of the Proprietors of the Navigation of the River Don, and authorised further cuts above Rotherham, while a further Bill of 1740 sought powers to improve the river from Barnby Dun to Fishlake Ferry, to avoid the shallows at Stainforth and Bramwith. The river was navigable to Rotherham in 1740, and to Tinsley by 1751.(Willan (1965))Stainforth was connected to the Trent by the opening on the and Keadby Canal in 1802 and to the and Calder Navigation by the Junction Canal, opened in 1905. There were plans to use compartment boats to carry coal on the navigation, but although some locks were lengthened around 1910, Long Sandall lock was not, and it was not until 1959 that it was extended to  and trains of 17 compartment boats could work through to Doncaster.(Hadfield (1973)) The navigation was the subject of one of the last major attempts in the UK to attract commercial freight to the waterways. In 1983, it was upgraded to the 700-tonne Eurobarge standard by deepening the channels and enlarging the locks as far as Rotherham. The expected rise in freight traffic did not occur, however.(Nicholson Vol 6 (2006), p.111)The cuts and navigable river sections, with the Stainforth and Keadby and the New Junction canals constitute the and South Yorkshire Navigation. Locks on the Bramwith to Rotherham section can accommodate boats which are , but above that, boats are restricted to  by the short Rotherham lock.(Cumberlidge (2009), pp.268-270)FloodingThe Don has produced a number of notable floods. On the night of 26 October 1536 a sudden rise in the level of the river prevented the forces of  the of Grace from crossing the river at Doncaster, forcing them to enter into negotiations with Henry VIIIs forces.(Hunter (1819), p.3)() The Sheffield Flood, which occurred on 11 March 1864 following the collapse of the Dale Dike Dam on a tributary of the River Loxley, destroyed 800 houses, destroyed or damaged most of the Don bridges upstream of Ladys Bridge (see Bridges over River Don section below) and killed 270 people.(Harrison (1864))The Don was also one of the rivers that flooded during the 2007 United Kingdom floods. Following high levels of rainfall, some 80 million cubic metres of rain fell on Yorkshire on 25 June 2007.() The river burst its banks in the late afternoon, flooding areas of Sheffield from the Wicker to Meadowhall, and two people died after being swept away by the water. Parts of Rotherham and Doncaster were flooded for the second time in 10 days.(Smith (2007), p.6) Two days later, the army were called in to assist at Barnby Dun after the river flooded large areas near Marsh Power Station.()HydrologyThe River Don, together with its main tributaries, the River Rother and the Dearne, form a river system with a catchment of , which held a population of around 1.4 million in 1997. Much of the region has an underlying geology of carboniferous rocks, containing coal measures, which have resulted in pollution of the river system where the coal has been mined. The headwaters rise on the moorlands of the Pennines, where the rocks are largely millstone grit, while the lower reaches pass through areas of alluvial and glacial material, up to  think, which lies on top of strata of Magensian limestone and Sherwood sandstone.(Amisah and Cowx (1999), p.192)The impacts of human habitation, particularly the inadequate treatment of sewage effluent, and the growth of mining in the upper reaches and the processing of metals in the Sheffield area have resulted in serious pollution of the river, and the depletion of fish stocks, to the extent that large parts of the Don contained no fish until the mid-1980s. Concerted efforts have been made to improve the water quality, by reducing the concentration of metals, the ammonia content, and the biological oxygen demand (BOD), which is a measure of the amount of oxygen that is needed by organisms to break down organic matter in the water. treatment works on the Don, notably those at Cheesebottom, on the west bank of the river at Thurgoland and Meadows at Tinsley, have been upgraded, as has that at Darton on the River Dearne. This has led to a great improvement in ammonia levels and BOD, further aided by the construction of biological treatment facilities for the processing of industrial effluent in the Doncaster area, while the decline in the steel industry in Sheffield has reduced the discharge of metals into the river.(Amisah and Cowx (1999), pp.191-192)Mining presents a different problem, as the mines have been abandoned, but the pollution continues. Near Penistone, ochre discharges into the river from old ganister mine workings, while at Wood, the ochre comes from a pile of waste metal on the river bank. A nearby paper mill has also been a significant polluter of the river. Some of the problem has been mitigated by the construction of lagoons, into which mine discharges have been diverted.( Water quality on the Dearne and the Rother has not improved as much as on the Don, and pollution of the lower reaches is compounded by the fact that the pollutants, which include dioxins, are locked up in the river bed sediments. Despite the steady improvement in water quality, restocking of the river with fish, attempted on several occasions between 1981 and 1994, was largely ineffective, caused by intermittent discharges of pollutants.(Amisah and Cowx (1999), p.198)Settlements on the River DonThese are the setttlements on the River Don from the source to the mouth. The largest city on the river is Sheffield. Settlements with a population of over 10,000 according to the 2001 census are shown in bold.

A series of small streams, including Great Grains and Black Grough join up, and within  enter Winscar Reservoir. Reaps Dyke rises within  of the source, and flows in a semicircle to the north, through Snailsden reservoir and Harden reservoir, to flow into another arm of Winscar reservoir. Just  from the source, Withens Brook rises, but flows westwards, to supply the reservoirs of Longdendale and the people of Manchester. To the south of Winscar reservoir, other streams supply Upper Windleden and Lower Windleden reservoirs.(Ordnance Survey, 1:25000 map, Sheet OL1)All of these reservoirs were built in the late 19th century for the Dewsbury and HeckmondwikeWaterworks Board. Lower Windleden was the first to be completed in 1872, with Upper Windleden following in 1890. Winscar, Snailsden and Harden were all completed in 1899, although Winscar was called Dunford Bridge at the time.(Barnsley Borough Landscape Character Assessment, Final Report, May 2002, accessed 2010-07-11) A new dam was built at Winscar between 1972 and 1975, and replaced the earlier earth dam. In order to fit it in, without destroying the village of Dunford Bridge, the dam is built of rock fill, which allows the faces to be much steeper than those of an earth dam, and the inner face is covered with two layers of asphaltic concrete, the first such use of this material on a dam in Britain. The dam is  high and contains around  of rock fill. Another innovation in its construction was the use of a hydraulic jump pool at the foot of the overflow chute, which dissipates the energy of the cascading water. The reservoir supplies drinking water to the Calder Valley, some  to the north,(Rennison (1996), p.202) and is also the base for Pennine Sailing Club, who offer basic training in sailing skills, on courses certified by the Yachting Association.(Pennine Sailing Club, overview, accessed 2010-07-11)The Don flows from the foot of Winscar Dam, close to the eastern portal of the Tunnel, through the Hamlet of Dunford Bridge, and continues, first east and then south east, on its way to Sheffield.( Near Penistone, the river is joined by Scout Dike, which flows from the Ingbirchworth, Royd Moor and Scout Dike reservoirs. The Don River or River Porter, on which there are three more reservoirs, joins the Don near Deepcar, while at Wharncliffe Side, the Ewden Beck joins, after flowing through Broomhead and More Hall reservoirs. By the time it reaches Oughtibridge, the river is below the  contour.Industrial sitesBelow Oughtibridge, the course of the river is marked by a series of weirs, which were used to impound water, so that it could be used to power mills, hammers and grinding wheels. The gradient of the river bed is less than that of most of the Dons tributaries, which required the weirs to be spaced further apart, to prevent water from one mill backing up and preventing the next mill upstream from operating. The river falls by  between Oughtibridge and Brightside, a distance of , and by 1600, there were sufficient weirs that no new ones were built subsequently, although there were a number of cases where additional mills were built, which used water from an existing weir. Most of the mill buildings have long since gone, but the weirs remain.(Ball Crossley and Flavell, (2006), p.2) All of the weirs on this section of the Don followed a similar pattern, with a weir built at an angle across the river, and a goit or channel leading from the lower edge to a reservoir or dam running parallel to the river. After the works, a tail goit returned water to the river. Water supply to the dam was controlled by shuttles which could be raised to allow water to enter the head goit.(Ball Crossley and Flavell, (2006), pp.xviii-xx)The weir by Station Lane, Oughtibridge served the Upper Middlewood forge, described as a tilt in the sources, as it had a tilt hammer which was raised up and allowed to drop to shape the metal. The weir is in good order, although much of the original structure has been replaced by concrete steps. Next came Middlewood Works, which was a rolling mill and slitting mill, splitting bars of iron into thin strips for the manufacture of nails. Four water wheels were recorded in the 1820s, and water power was still being uses in 1900. The site was cleared after 1985, but the stone weir, with its nine bays, remains.(Ball Crossley and Flavell, (2006), pp.2-5) Beeley Wood or Nova Scotia Tilts was a sizeable operation, with eight water wheels operating in the 1830s, four wheels driving two forges, another two driving the bellows for the forges, and the final two driving two tilt hammers. The works was recorded as derelict by 1895. The next works was Hawksley or Clay Wheels which employed 54 men in 1794, and was still using water power in 1895. The site was used to make scythes until after 1941, when a film, which can be seen at the Island Museum, was made of its activity. The weir has five bays, but is deteriorating.(Ball Crossley and Flavell, (2006), pp.5-8)Wadsley weir supplied a series of works which were situated to the east of the river channel. Wadsley Bridge paper mill was operational by 1709, and a tilt was also working by 1806. The wheel was  in diameter and  wide when it was surveyed in 1855, by which time the works had become Niagara Works. It was recorded as a forge which was still using water power in 1907. The weir remains, together with the shuttles which controlled the flow into the head goit, although the channel itself has been built over. Wadsley Bridge corn mill, which became a forge around 1800, originally took its water supply from the head goit of the paper mill, but was later connected to the tail goit. Wadsley Furnace was also located in this area. It was built for the Earl of Shrewsbury by 1583, but the blast furnace is thought to have been defunct by the 1670s. The final works in this section was Wadsley Forge or Wardsend Steel Works, which was operational from 1581 to the late 19th century, although the precise function varied. In 1819, there were two wheels supplying power to 69 troughs, where blades were ground. By 1849, it was described as a forge, and a high pressure steam engine was operational in 1855, to supplement the  water wheel. The dams were out of use by 1892,(Ball Crossley and Flavell, (2006), pp.8-13) and parts of the site are now occupied by Hillsborough Football Stadium.Near the tail goit of the Wadsley works, the Don was joined by a small tributary, on which was located Rawsons Mill or Bark Mill. The mill building was separated from its dam by the building of the railway. The mill housed grinding wheels in 1862, but was used for milling corn in 1934. The dam remains full, overflowing through a culvert which passes beneath the railway. Owlerton Rolling Mill was next, located on the west bank, but was destroyed by fire around 1883. It had been reconstructed by 1907, when steam power assisted the water wheels, and was demolished in 1936. Only a small part of the weir remains.(Ball Crossley and Flavell, (2006), pp.13-15) The next weir supplied Old Park corn mill, which was built around 1673. In 1807 a lease was issued to a group of 32 tenants, which included a miller, grinders, cutlers, a button maker, a scissorsmith and an ivory turner. In the early 20th century, it was known as Old Park Forge, and so had presumably changed its use. Old Park paper, silver or rolling mill followed. In 1795 it had a  undershot wheel for rolling copper plates, and another of  for rolling silver. The River Loxley joins the Don opposite the mill site, and the building was badly damaged by the great flood of 1864. The tenant claimed 1,932 in compensation, and actually received 1,720. A steam engine replaced the large water wheel in 1875, and the rest of the works was electrified in 1920. Sheffield Steel Rolling Co. continued to work the site until 1980.(Ball Crossley and Flavell, (2006), pp.15-16)Sandbed wheel was built in 1723, and by 1794, there were three water wheels supplying 52 grinding troughs. A steam engine was supplementing the wheels by 1886, but the wheels remained in use until at least 1907. The weir and the shuttles controlling the flow in the head goit remain. Below this, Morton wheels are known to have existed in 1581. The works became the Philadelphia Works around 1807, and a claim for 6,204 was made and received for damage caused by the 1864 flood.(Ball Crossley and Flavell, (2006), pp.17-21) Next came Kelham Wheel, which was used as a cutlers wheel, a silk mill, and a cotton mill. Following fires in 1792 and 1810, the mill was rebuilt to use steam power, and became the Britannia Corn Mills after 1864. The buildings were demolished in 1975, but the weir remains in good order, and is one of the largest in Sheffield. Below this were the Town Corn Mill and wheel, which was water powered until 1877, and was the subject of an archaeological investigation in 1999, which uncovered the remains of the wheel pits.(Ball Crossley and Flavell, (2006), pp.21-26)Wicker Tilts and wheel was really two works, a grinding wheel known to have been working in 1581, and a tilt forge built in the 1740s. A second tilt was added near Ladys Bridge by 1752. The grinding wheel, which supplied 36 troughs, was replaced by a wire mill in the 1870s, and was still using water power in 1895, by which time the tilts were using steam power. The weir was close to Ladys Bridge, and the head goit flowed through one of the arches of the bridge. It is thought that there are several goits in culverts near Blonk Street, but their exact extent is unknown.(Ball Crossley and Flavell, (2006), pp.27-28) The culverted Brook joins the Sheaf, which is also culverted, below Sheffield Railway Station, and the combined flows join the Don between Ladys Bridge and Blonk Street bridge.Five Weirs WalkThe section of the river from Ladys Bridge to Meadowhall and the junction of the river with the Sheffield Canal has been designated as the Five Weirs Walk, by the creation of a footpath which closely follows its course. It contains the final five weirs before the navigable section is reached.Walk Mill weir supplied the Upper and Nether Walk mills and wheels. The Nether Walk mill is thought to have been the site of a fulling mill mentioned in 1332, and was still operating as a fulling mill in 1760, when there were also two cutlers wheels at the lower site and one at the upper. The use of water wheels ceased in 1853, and both sites were recorded as the Albion Iron and Steel Works in 1864. Burton Weir supplied Royds mill and wheels, which also operated on two sites, and included a corn mill and cutlers wheels. Steam power was used from 1860, although a redundant water wheel remained in situ until 1950.(Ball Crossley and Flavell, (2006), pp.28-31)Sandersons weir provided water for the Upper Hammer, on the south side of the river, which was converted into the Attercliffe slitting mill in 1746. By 1802 it was described as being in a decayed state, and the dam and goit were filled in by 1818. The weir also supplied the Nether Hammer on the north side of the river, which was first recorded in the 1580s. The forge was sold in 1869, one part to the Midland Railway, and the other to Sandersons, who had six water wheels in 1895, but the works was running on steam power by 1907. In addition to the weir, the head goit is still visibile, passing under the railway twice, to disappear into a culverted drain.(Ball Crossley and Flavell, (2006), pp.31-34)Brightside weir supplied a corn mill from before 1383 until 1690. Two cutlers wheels were added in 1706, and the works had become a forge by 1789. Four wheels were recorded in 1895, and a set of tilt hammers from the site were rescued and moved to Industrial Hamlet. Hadfields Weir is the final weir on this stretch, which supplied Parker Wheel initially, and then a paper mill from the 1750s. At various times there were two flour mills, two forges and then a rolling mill. The precise location of the works is difficult to trace, as the river has been straightened below the weir, but the weir itself can be seen from Meadowhall Shopping Centre.(Ball Crossley and Flavell, (2006), pp.34-38)Bridges over River DonThis section provides details of some of the many bridges crossing the River Don, in west-to-east (river source to river mouth) order.Bridges in Hillsborough areaLeppings Lane bridgeThis carries the A6102 over the River Don.  Leppings Lane was originally Leapings Lane which got its name from some nearby stepping stones over the river.()Hillsborough Stadium footbridge This footbridge connects Parkside Road with the main entrance to the football stadium.  The bridge was built as part of the major 7 million re-development for the Euro 1996 international competition.  As regards the stadium itself, the first match played was on 2 September 1899 and in 1966 the stadium was selected as one of the venues for the Football World Cup.  Very close to the footbridge is a memorial to the 96 fans that lost their lives at Hillsborough in 1989, during the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.  In June 2007, the River Don burst its banks during a period of severe weather in the area and the whole ground was flooded with several feet of water.  As part of the abortive plans for England staging the 2018 World Cup, a new bridge had been planned across the River Don for entry to the West Stand and would have been slightly upstream of the main entrance footbridge.Penistone Road North bridgeThis carries the A61 dual carriageway across the River Don.  This part of the A61, which fronts the football ground, was widened in time for the 1966 World Cup matches and still features the flagpoles for the event.()Cadburys works bridges There are two (private) bridges that connect the Cadburys works on either side of the Don.  However, there is a (public) footpath along the northern bank of the Don (this will probably eventually form part of the planned Upper Don Walk()) which goes under the two bridges.  The Cadburys (previously Bassetts) works is one of the major employers in the area.  The George Bassett & Co. Ltd sweet factory is one of the longest serving of local firms, made world famous by the manufacture of Liquorice Allsorts.  The firm was established in Sheffield in 1842 but did not come to Hillsborough (Owlerton) until 1934 when Bassetts son-in-law Samuel Meggit Johnson built a large factory on Beulah Road (on the south side of the Don).  The factory was enlarged in the inter-war period as new products such as Jelly Babies, Wine Gums and Liquorice Novelties were added to the range.  In 1989 Bassetts was purchased by the Cadbury Schweppes group and became part of its confectionery subsidiary Cadbury Trebor Bassett.()  In 2010, Cadburys was taken over by Kraft.()Wardsend BridgeThis bridge in Hillsborough carries Livesey Street over the Don to Club Mill Road. The previous bridge was a two-arched stone bridge, built in the 18th century to provide access to Wardsend Cemetery,() and was destroyed by the floods on 25 June 2007.()  It was rebuilt as a  wide single-span integral bridge at an estimated cost of 673,000 and re-opened in early 2009.()Bridges in Sheffield areaHillfoot Bridge This bridge carries Neepsend Lane (B6074) over the River Don.  On 11 March 1864, the previous wooden bridge was swept away by the Sheffield Flood, caused by the collapse of Dike Dam.()  The bridge was replaced by a three-arched stone structure in 1885. Alterations made in 1912 included rounded approaches, and lighting was provided by cast-iron gas lamps, contributed by the Neepsend Gasworks, which was located nearby.( Hillfoot bridge)Rutland Road Bridge This bridge carries Rutland Road (B6070) over the River Don.  In the 1800s, this bridge was commonly known as Neepsend Bridge.(  In the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864, the Neepsend bridge managed to withstand the onslaught although a large amount of debris was piled up against it. The three elliptical arches were built in 1854, although the parapet is slightly later, as it had to be rebuilt following damage sustained during the flood.( Rutland Road bridge)Ball Street Bridge This road bridge carries Ball Street over the River Don.  The original footbridge at this point was destroyed in the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864. Samuel Harrison writes: The Ball Street foot bridge, adjoining Mr. Millss tannery, was destroyed. Although it was constructed of iron, it was torn down by the force of the water, and bent about as though it were only a piece of pasteboard.  A large portion of it might be seen long afterwards lying in the river in a sloping position, and not entirely disconnected from its original position at one end. () It was rebuilt in 1865, with three cast-iron spans which were manufactured at the Milton Iron Works in Elsecar. It features pierced Gothic parapets.(Harman (2004), p.170) The spans are carried on stone piers, and the bridge was widened in 1900.( Ball Street bridge) Kelham Weir (also known as Ball Street Weir) is just downstream of the bridge.Borough Bridge Borough bridge and Corporation Street, which crosses it, were laid out as part of the same development, and named to celebrate the incorporation of Sheffield as a borough. Samual Worth and Samual Furness Holmes were responsible for its design, and the foundation stone carries the date 12 March 1853.(Upper Don Walk, interpretation board by bridge) The bridge is built of stone, has three segmental arches, and was completed in 1856. It is a II listed structure.( Borough bridge) During the Great Flood, large quantities of debris built up behind it, and then caused the iron bridge below it to be swept away.( Corporation Street is now part of the A61, and the bridge forms the west side of the inner relief road roundabout.Iron FootbridgeThe iron footbridge in the middle of the roundabout on the A61 inner ring road was first built as a wooden bridge around 1726. It was important, as it enabled people to reach an old road which ran to Leeds and Barnsley, passing through Pitsmoor. In 1795 it was replaced by one of the earliest iron bridges, made by Samual Walker, an ironmaster from Rotherham. The famous iron bridge at Coalbrookdale had been built only 15 years earlier, and there were only 7 or 8 other iron bridges in the world. It was swept away in 1864, and replaced by a new iron bridge, built at the Milton Ironworks near Elsecar. It was partially rebuilt in 1921, and the iron ballustrade is marked J Butler & Co Ltd, Stanningley Ironworks, Leeds 1921.() Its function was replaced by Borough bridge when Sheffield Rolling Mills and Forge built over the path which ran from it to Millsands and Bridge Street, but it remains in place because it also carries a large water main over the river.(()A61 Roundabout east side bridgeThis road bridge carries the A61 inner relief road over the river. It was built as part of a 65 million scheme to divert traffic away from the city centre, which included  of dual carriageway running from Penistone Road to the Wicker. The road was opened on 22 November 2007 by Rosie Winterton MP.()Nursery Street FootbridgeThis footbridge connects the re-development of the former Exchange Brewery site on the west side of the River Don with Nursery Street on the east.  The bridge was built around 2005.Ladys Bridge This bridge carries the A6135 over the River Don and connects Sheffield city centre with The Wicker.  Bridge is the oldest bridge crossing the Don within Sheffield, its five arches being constructed in 1485. It was widened on the south-east side in the late 19th century, was restored in the late 20th century, and is a Grade II listed structure.( Ladys Bridge)  Wicker Weir is just upstream of Ladys Bridge.Blonk Street BridgeThe culverted Sheaf joins the Don beside Blonk Street bridge, named after Benjamin Blonk, who was the tenant of Castle Orchards Wheel from the 1750s to the 1770s.(Ball Crossley and Flavell (2006), p.191) The three-arched bridge was built by Woodhead and Hurst between 1827 and 1828. It was altered in 1913 and has cast iron balustrades.(Harman (2004), p.157)Willey Street footbridgeIn order to link The Wicker with Furnival Road, a new  steel footbridge was erected on 14 July 2010. The bridge was funded by the Environment Agency, Yorkshire Forward and the European Regional Development Fund as part of a multi-million pound scheme to regenerate The Wicker and surrounding area. Original plans were for a  bridge crossing the river at an angle, but the more direct route was eventually adopted. It is part of some flood defence improvements, and includes a trap for floating debris beneath it. The design is based on butterfly wings, and the project also included a new link to the Five Weirs Walk and the installation of footway lighting.()Derek Dooley Way BridgeThis bridge takes the Inner Ring Road over the River Don.  This part of the ring road was finished in 2000 as Cutlers Gate and was subsequently renamed in 2008 as Derek Dooley Way,() in honour of the late Sheffielder who played football for Wednesday before breaking his leg and going on to perform a number of backroom roles across the city at United. The Derek Dooley Way named section of the ring road runs from the Parkway to the Wicker.Wicker Viaduct The Arches are a  railway viaduct, designed by the architects Weightman, Hadfield and Goldie to a specification by the engineer John Fowler in 1848. They were built by Miller, Blackie and Shortedge, and carried the Central Railway to Manchester across the canal, roads and the River Don at The Wicker.(Rennison (1996), pp.200-201) The 27 southern arches are wider than the 12 to the north of the Wicker, as Victoria railway station was built on them. The arch that takes the railway over the Don has stone abutments and a lattice girder span which was made in the late 19th century.( Wicker Arches) The Bridge is suspended from this span.Cobweb BridgeThe Cobweb Bridge was completed in 2002. Its design was the solution to the difficult problem of how to pass the Weirs Walk, a waymarked cycle path and walkway which follows the river from Ladys Bridge to Meadowhall, under the massive Wicker Arches viaduct and at the same time link one bank of the River Don to the other. Without the bridge, the footpath would have had to make a  detour.  Designed by Sheffield City Councils Structures Section, the entire  long bridge is suspended on a web of steel cables secured to the underside of the Viaduct, and it is this feature which gives it its name.Bailey Bridge This is part of a  section of the Five Weirs Walk that crosses the river from Effingham Road to Attercliffe Road.  The bridge here makes use of an historic second world war bridge.  The bridge was placed here on 15 October 2006, was constructed in 1945, was built probably for the D-Day landings and was chosen deliberately to celebrate the world-beating engineering design. The unique features of the invention were that a bridge capable of carrying tanks could be erected in a matter of hours from standard lightweight modules with little more than human muscle power and hand tools.()Midland Railway Viaduct This viaduct carries the railway from Sheffield to Meadowhall and the rest of Yorkshire.  The railway was opened by the Railway in 1870, at the same time as the current Station on Pond Street replaced the Wicker railway station. Under the north-most arch of the 4-arch viaduct is suspended a metal walkway, which is part of the Five Weirs Walk.()Norfolk BridgeThis 3-arch bridge was built in 1856 and carries Leveson Street (B6071) over the river.  It was named after Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk.( Norfolk bridge) He was a British Conservative politician and philanthropist. He served as Postmaster General between 1895 and 1900, but is best remembered for his philanthropical work, which concentrated on Roman Catholic causes and the city of Sheffield.  In July 1897 he was appointed the first Lord Mayor of Sheffield.  He was made an honorary Freeman of the City of Sheffield in 1900.  He also donated funds for the building of the University of Sheffield and was its initial Chancellor between 1905 and 1917.  Burton Weir is immediately downstream of Norfolk Bridge.Bridges in Attercliffe / Brightside areaWashford BridgeThis carries the A6178 Attercliffe Road over the River Don.  Washford or Westforth bridge, at the Sheffield end of Attercliffe, was first recorded in a will of 1535. It was rebuilt in wood in 1608 and 1647, then in stone in 1672, 1789 and 1794.() In 1940 an air raid badly damaged Washford Bridge and the adjoining pub, The Bridge.()East Coast Road Bridge  This bridge carries East Coast Road over the River Don and connects Brightside Lane with Attercliffe Road.  The bridge is of metal construction with a central pier.  Sandersons Weir is downstream of this bridge.Scrapyard railway bridgeThis bridge carries a railway siding leading to the metal scrap yard on East Coast Road.  Currently operated by European Metal Recycling,() the scrapyard was previously known as Coopers Metals () and Marple & Gillott () and was a specialist in dismantling railway vehicles.Stevenson Road BridgeThis bridge carries Stevenson Road over the River Don and connects Brightside Lane with Attercliffe Road.  It was named after one of the owners of the Attercliffe Steam Corn Mill.()  The bridge was strengthened in 2004, so that HGV vehicles could continue to use it.()Newhall Road Bridge This bridge carries Newhall Road (B6083) over the River Don and connects Brightside Lane with Attercliffe Road.  In the seventeenth century, Newhall Road Bridge was a packhouse bridge in a very rural setting.  The road takes its name from a handsome red-brick house known as Newhall, which stood where in later years Newhall School was built.  The house was inhabited by the Fell family. The Fells were a family of wealthy iron masters, dating from the 17th century. They were known to have gained their wealth and position from the oldest iron works in Sheffield, named the Attercliffe Forge.()Amberley Street footbridgeThis bridge enables the Five Weirs Walk to cross the River Don.  To the west of the bridge, the walk follows the banks of the Don for several miles, while to the east, it goes on a lengthy diversion along roads away from the river to avoid the Forgemasters steelworks which occupy the land on both sides of the Don.  There is some debate about whether the original wooden Abyssinia Bridge (see section below) crossed the river at the same place as the current Amberley Street footbridge.Abyssinia BridgeThis bridge carries the A6102 Outer Ring Road dual carriageway (Hawke Street / Jansen Street) over the River Don.  The bridge got its name from the 1868 invasion of Abyssinia by British troops.()  The first Abyssinia Bridge was built of wood in 1868. It was later replaced by a metal bridge which remained the footpath link between Attercliffe and Brightside until Hawke Street and Jansen Street were joined by a road bridge in 1908.  There is some debate about whether the original wooden Abyssinia Bridge crossed the river at the same place as the current Amberley Street footbridge.()Forgemaster works bridgesThere are three bridges (two road and one pipe) in that section of the Don between Abyssinia Bridge and Brightside Weir which is inaccessible to the public.  They are used to connect the Sheffield Forgemasters steelworks which occupy the land on both sides of the Don.Weedon Street BridgeAlso known as Brightside Bridge, this carries Weedon Street, which links Brightside Lane with Attercliffe Common.  This bridge is downstream of Brightside Weir.  The bridge is mentioned in the records of the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864 as follows: The watchman on duty near Brightside Bridge had a very narrow escape. When passing the bridge he was startled by a singular sound as though the steam from a distant engine had suddenly been let off, and immediately after the flood came rushing down. The water rose rapidly over the bridge and the road. To escape he mounted the wall, intending to walk along it to some place of safety; but in another moment he felt the wall tremble beneath him. He then jumped off it, and rushed through the waters nearly breast high towards the Midland railway, which he succeeded in reaching, and down which he walked to Sheffield.()Bridges in Meadowhall / Tinsley areaSheffield District Railway bridge This single-span metal bridge carried the District Railway over the River Don.  It was opened in 1900, was integrated into the LNER in 1923 and, in Railways days, it connected Marshalling Yard with the Midland main line at Brightside Junction.  The railway lines were lifted in 1999, but the bridge was still intact in 2010.Meadowhall Way (SW) bridgeThis was opened at the same time as the Meadowhall Shopping Centre.Meadowhall works bridgeThis bridge provides a pedestrian route between Meadowhall Road and that part of the Weirs Walk that skirts the Meadowhall Shopping Centre.  Erected by Newton Chambers & Co Ltd, Thorncliffe Ironworks,(Metal plaque on side of bridge) the bridge originally provided access to one of the works (Dunford Hadfields, Shardlows or Arthur Lees) that used to occupy the shopping centre site.()  This bridge is just downstream of Hadfields Weir.Meadowhall Interchange footbridge  This cable-stayed enclosed footbridge connects Interchange with the Meadowhall Shopping Centre.  It provides pedestrian access to Meadowhall from the Wincobank area of Sheffield, the railway station, the tram station and the bus station.  The footbridge crosses the A6109 Meadowhall Road and the Five Weirs Walk, as well as the River Don.Meadowhall Way (N) bridgeThese two bridges were opened at the same time as the Meadowhall Shopping Centre.Meadowhall Coach Park bridgesThese two bridges (foot and road) were opened at the same time as the Meadowhall Shopping Centre.  They connect the coach park and overflow car park to the shopping centre.Supertram Bridge This bridge carries the Supertram line over the River Don.  The Fitzalan Square to Meadowhall section of the tram network was opened on 21 March 1994.South Yorkshire Railway bridgeThis bridge carries the Sheffield to Rotherham freight-only railway line.  The railway was originally part of the Yorkshire Railway, which later became part of the Central Railway.M1 Tinsley ViaductViaduct carries the M1 London to Leeds motorway and the A631 road over the River Don.  This two-tier viaduct is over  long and was opened in 1968, at a cost of 6 million.  It was strengthened in 1983 and again in 2006. The 2006 refurbishment involved the addition of 2,500 tonnes of steel and 3,500 tonnes of reinforced concrete, took three years to complete and cost 81 million. The three lanes of the M1 in each direction were reduced to two by closing the outer lane on each carriageway, as a result of an EU directive on the introduction of 40-tonne lorries.()Blackburn Meadows bridgeThis works bridge may once have provided road access to Meadows Power Station.  The area around this bridge would have been affected by the Halfpenny Link Road development proposed in 2005.()Halfpenny Bridge This bridge carries the Trail over the final non-navigable section of the River Don.  The Canal joins the Don immediately downstream of this footbridge. A century ago it would have cost half a penny for anyone to use the ferry crossing the Tinsley waterway.  But 70 years ago, the ferry  and the charge  was scrapped with the building of a bridge.  On 15 October 2001, the current bridge was opened to replace the older unsafe bridge.  The current bridge is still named Halfpenny Bridge, but cost half a million pounds.  The bridge is of steel bowstring construction, with a  span.()  The Sheffield Halfpenny Bridge is not to be confused with the Bridge near Lechlade in Gloucestershire, which marks the start of the navigable River Thames.Flora and faunaFig trees grow on a stretch of the river bank in Sheffield. The seeds do not normally germinate in the English climate, but the use of river water for quenching hot metal in some of the foundries resulted in water temperatures rising above 20 deg C. At these temperatures, germination occurred. Most of the trees are over 50 years old, and the demise of such industry along the river has reduced water temperatures, so that there is no evidence of new trees growing.(Review of Flora Britannica (2005) by Richard Mabey, The Guardian, 10 December 2005, accessed 2010-07-30)The industrial nature of the region led to a severe pollution problem for the river, but efforts to improve the water quality and habitat have met with some succes, as salmon have been reported in the river near Doncaster.(Environment Agency, Combined Sewage Overflow appeals, River Don, accessed 2010-08-08)See also*of the United Kingdom*Don Navigation, for information on the navigable part of the River Don, east of Tinsley.ReferencesBibliography******* (wikisource)*****(flod i England)Don (Ouse)(Angleterre)Don, South Yorkshire(elv i England)i South Yorkshire(South Yorkshire)( )(engelsk flod)

Seamount
A seamount is a mountain rising from the ocean seafloor that does not reach to the waters surface (level), and thus is not an island. These are typically formed from extinct volcanoes, that rise abruptly and are usually found rising from a seafloor of  depth. They are defined by oceanographers as independent features that rise to at least  above the seafloor. The peaks are often found hundreds to thousands of metres below the surface, and are therefore considered to be within the sea.(Nybakken, James W. and Bertness, Mark D., 2008. Marine Biology: An Ecological Approach. Sixth Edition. Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco) There are an estimated 100,000 seamounts across the globe, with only a few having been studied. Seamounts come in all shapes and sizes, and follow a distinctive pattern of growth, activity, and death. In recent years, several active seamounts have been observed, for example Loihi in the Islands.Because of their abundance, seamounts are one of the most common ecosystems in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, as well as their elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and mammals alike. Their aggregational effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are ongoing concerns on the negative impact of fishing on seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus). 95% of ecological damage is done by trawling, which literally scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.Because of their large numbers, many seamounts remain to be properly studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working to close the gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that have the potential to generate massive tsunamis. Geography Seamounts can be found in every basin in the world, distributed extremely widely both in space and in age. A seamount is technically defined as an isolated elevational rising of  or more from the surrounding seafloor, and with a limited summit area,( a definition drafted in 1964. This definition is no longer strictly adhered to however, and some scientists recognize features as short as  as seamounts. Under the strictest definition there are up to 100,000 seamounts in the oceans, and under the loosest there may be as many as 2 million;( however, there are many very small and very deep seamounts that are difficult to analyze, so the true number may never be known.(Most seamounts are volcanic in origin, and thus tend to be found on crust near ridges, plumes, and arcs. Nearly half of the worlds seamounts are found in the Ocean, and the rest are distributed mostly across the Atlantic and Indian oceans. Overall there is also a significant bias in distribution towards the southern hemisphere.(Seamounts are often found in groupings or submerged archipelagos, a classic example being the Seamounts, an extension of the Islands. Formed millions of years ago by volcanism, they have since subsided far below sea level. This long chain of islands and seamounts extends thousands of kilometers northwest from the island of Hawaii. Isolated seamounts and those without clear volcanic origins are less common; examples include Seamount, Seamount, Seamount and Ridge.() If all known seamounts were collected into one area, they would make a landform the size of Europe.() Their overall abundance makes them one of the most common, and least understood, marine structures and biomes on Earth,( a sort of exploratory frontier.(center|thumb|600px|A partial mapping of some of the worlds major seamounts Geology  Geochemistry and evolution File:Submarine Eruption-numbers.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of a submarine eruption. (key: 1. Water vapor cloud 2. Water  3. Stratum 4. Lava flow 5. conduit 6. chamber 7. Dike 8. lava) Click to enlarge.Most seamounts are built by one of two volcanic processes. Volcanoes near plate boundaries and ridges are built by decompression melting of rock in the mantle that then floats up to the surface, while volcanoes formed near subducting zones are created because the subducting plate adds volatiles to the rising plate that raise its point. Which process formed the seamount has a profound effect on its eruptive materials. Lava flows from mid-ocean ridge and plate boundary seamounts are mostly basaltic (both tholeiitic and alkalic), whereas flows from subducting ridge volcanoes are mostly calc-alkaline lavas. Compared to mid-ocean ridge seamounts, subduction zone seamounts generally have more sodium, alkali, and volatile abundances, and less magnesium, resulting in more explosive, viscous eruptions.(All volcanic seamounts follow a particular pattern of growth, activity, subsidence and eventual extinction. The first stage of a seamounts evolution is its early activity, building its flanks and core up from the sea floor. This is followed by a period of intense volcanism, during which the new volcano erupts almost all (e.g. 98%) of its total magmatic volume. The seamount may even grow above sea level to become an island (for example, the 2009 eruption of Tonga). After a period of explosive activity near the ocean surface, the eruptions slowly die away. With eruptions becoming infrequent and the seamount losing its ability to maintain itself, the volcano starts to erode. After finally becoming extinct (possibly after a brief rejuvenated period), they are ground back down by the waves. Seamounts are built in a far more dynamic oceanic setting then their land counterparts, resulting in horizontal subsidation as the seamount moves on the grinding plate towards a subduction zone. Here it is subducted under the plate margin and ultimately destroyed, but it may leave evidence of its passage by carving an indentation into the opposing wall of the subduction trench. The majority of seamounts have already completed their eruptive cycle, so access to early flows by researchers is limited by late volcanic activity.()Ocean-ridge volcanoes in particular have been observed to follow a certain pattern in terms of eruptive activity, first observed with Hawaiian seamounts but now shown to be the process followed by all seamounts of the ocean-ridge type. During the first stage the volcano erupts basalt of various types, caused by various degrees of mantle melting. In the second, most active stage of its life, ocean-ridge volcanoes erupt tholeiitic to mildly alkalic basalt as a result of a larger area melting in the mantle. This is finally capped by alkalic flows late in its eruptive history, as the link between the seamount and its source of volcanism is cut by crustal movement. Some seamounts also experience a brief rejuvenated period after a hiatus of 1.5 to 10 million years, the flows of which are highly alkalic and produce many xenoliths.(In recent years, geologists have confirmed that a number of seamounts are active undersea volcanoes; two examples are Loihi in the Islands and Vailuluu in the Manua Group (Samoa).( Lava types File:Pillow basalt crop l.jpg|thumb|right|lava, a type of basalt flow that originates from lava-water interactions during submarine eruptions.()The most apparent lava flows at a seamount are the eruptive flows which cover their flanks, however igneous intrusions, in the forms of dikes and sills, are also an important part of seamount growth. The most common type of flow is lava, named so after its unusual shape. Less common are sheet flows, which are glassy and marginal, and indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks dominate shallow-water seamounts. They are the products of the explosive activity of seamounts that are near the waters surface, and can also form from mechanical wear of existing volcanic rock.( Structure Seamounts can form in a wide variety of tectonic settings, resulting in a very diverse structural bank. Seamounts come in a wide variety of structural shapes, from conical to flat-topped to complexly shaped.( Some are built very large and very low, such as Guyot() and Seamount;() others are built more steeply, such as Seamount() and Seamount.( ) Some seamounts also have a carbonate or sediment cap.(Many seamounts show signs of intrusive activity, which is likely to lead to inflation, steepening of volcanic slopes, and ultimately, flank collapse.( There are also several sub-classes of seamounts. The first are guyots, seamount with a flat top. These tops must be  or more below the surface of the sea; the diameters of these flat summits can be over .(accessdate24 July 2010)  Knolls are isolated elevation spikes measuring less than . Lastly, pinnacles are small pillar-like seamounts.(Ecology Ecological role of seamounts Seamounts are exceptionally important to their biome ecologically, but their role in their environment is little understood. Because they project out above the surrounding sea floor, they disturb standard water flow, causing eddies and associated hydrological phenomena that ultimately result in water movement in an otherwise still ocean bottom. Currents have been measured at up to 0.9 knots, or 48 centimeters per second. Because of this upwelling seamounts often carry above-average plankton populations, seamounts are thus centers where the fish that feed on them aggregate, in turn falling prey to further predation, making seamounts important biological hotspots.()Seamounts provide habitats and spawning grounds for these larger animals, including numerous fish. Some species, including oreo (Allocyttus niger) and cardinalfish (Apogon nigrofasciatus), have been shown to occur more often on seamounts then anywhere else on the ocean floor. mammals, sharks, tuna, and cephalopods all congregate over seamounts to feed, as well as some species of seabirds when the features are particularly shallow.(File:Bubblegum coral on davidson.jpg|thumb|right|Grenadier fish (Coryphaenoides sp.) and bubblegum coral (Paragorgia arborea) on the crest of Seamount. These are two species attracted to the seamount; Paragorgia arborea in particular grows in the surrounding area as well, but nowhere near as profusely.()Seamounts often project upwards into shallower zones more hospitable to sea life, providing habitats for marine species that are not found on or around the surrounding deeper ocean bottom. Because seamounts are isolated from each other they form undersea islands creating the same biogeographical interest. As they are formed from rock, the substrate is much harder than the surrounding sedimentary deep sea floor. This causes a different type of fauna to exist than on the seafloor, and leads to a theoretically higher degree of endemism.() However, recent research especially centered at Seamount suggests that seamounts may not be especially endemic, and discussions are ongoing on the effect of seamounts on endemicity. They have, however, been confidently shown to provide a habitat to species that difficulty surviving elsewhere.()()The volcanic rocks on the slopes of seamounts are heavily populated by feeders, particularly corals, which capitalize on the strong currents around the seamount to supply them with food. This is in sharp contrast with the typical deep-sea habitat, where deposit-feeding animals rely on food they get off the ground.( In zones extensive coral growth results in the formation of coral atolls late in the seamounts life.((In addition soft sediments tend to accumulate on seamounts, which are typically populated by polychaetes (annelid worms) oligochaetes (microdrile worms), and gastropod mollusks (slugs). Xenophyophores have also been found. They tend to gather small particulates and thus form beds, which alters sediment deposition and creates a habitat for smaller animals.( Many seamounts also have vent communities, for example Suiyo() and Loihi seamounts.( accessdate2009-03-02) This is helped by geochemical exchange between the seamounts and the ocean water.(Seamounts may thus be vital stopping points for some migratory animals, specifically whales. Some recent research indicates whales may use such features as navigational aids throughout their migration.() For a long time it has been surmised that many pelagic animals visit seamounts as well, to gather food, but proof of this aggregating effect has been lacking. The first demonstration of this conjecture has  been published.(Morato, T., Varkey, D.A., Damaso, C., Machete, M., Santos, M., Prieto, R., Santos, R.S. and Pitcher, T.J. (2008). Evidence of a seamount effect on aggregating visitors. Marine Ecology Progress Series 357: 23-32.) Fishing The effect that seamounts have on fish populations has not gone unnoticed by the commercial fishing industry. Seamounts were first extensively fished in the second half of the 20th century, due to poor management practices and increased fishing pressure seriously depleting stock numbers on the typical fishing ground, the shelf. Seamounts have been the site of targeted fishing since that time.()Nearly 80 species of fish and shellfish are commercially harvested from seamounts, including lobster (Palinuridae), mackerel (Scombridae and others), red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus), red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), tuna (Scombridae), roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus), and perch (Percidae).( Conservation File:Orange roughy.png|thumb|right|Because of overfishing at their seamount spawning grounds, stocks of roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) have plummeted; experts say that it could take decades for the species to restore itself to its former numbers.(The ecological conservation of seamounts is hurt by the simple lack of information available. Seamounts are very poorly studied, with only 350 of the estimated 100,000 seamounts in the world having received sampling, and fewer than 100 in depth.( Much of this lack of information can be attributed to a lack of technology, and to the daunting task of reaching these underwater structures; the technology to fully explore them has only been around the last few decades. Before consistent conservation efforts can begin, the seamounts of the world must first be mapped, a task that is still in progress.(Overfishing is a serious threat to seamount ecological welfare. There are several well-documented cases of fishery exploitation, for example the roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand and the armorhead (Pseudopentaceros richardsoni) near Japan and Russia.( The reason for this is that the fishes that are targeted over seamounts are typically long-lived, slow-growing, and slow-maturing. The problem is confounded by the dangers of trawling, which damages seamount surface communities, and the fact that many seamounts are located in international waters, making proper monitoring difficult.( trawling in particular is extremely devastating to seamount ecology, and is responsible for as much as 95% of ecological damage to seamounts.(Report of the Secretary-General (2006) The Impacts of Fishing on Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems Nations. 14 July 2006. Retrieved on 26 July 2010.)File:Koral1.jpg|thumb|left|Coral earings of this type are often made from coral harvested off seamounts.Corals from seamounts are also vulnerable, as they are highly valued for making jewellery and decorative objects. Significant harvests have been produced from seamounts, often leaving coral beds depleted.(Individual nations are beginning to note the effect of fishing on seamounts, and the Commission has agreed to fund the OASIS project, a detailed study of the effects of fishing on seamount communities in the Atlantic.( Another project working towards conservation is CenSeam, a of Marine Life project formed in 2005. CenSeam is intended to provide the framework needed to prioritise, integrate, expand and facilitate seamount research efforts in order to significantly reduce the unknown and build towards a global understanding of seamount ecosystems, and the roles they have in the biogeography, biodiversity, productivity and evolution of marine organisms.()()Possibly the best ecologically studied seamount in the world is Seamount, with six major expeditions recording over 60,000 species observations. The contrast between the seamount and the surrounding area was well-marked.( One of the primary ecological havens on the seamount is its deep sea coral garden, and many of the specimens noted were over a century old.( Following the expansion of knowledge on the seamount there was extensive support to make it a marine sanctuary, a motion that was granted in 2008 as part of the Bay National Marine Sanctuary.() Much of what is known about seamounts ecologically is based on observations from Davidson.(( Another such seamount is Seamount, which has also been declared a marine protected area by Canada for its ecological richness.( ) Exploration Image:Sealevel chart.jpg||thumb|right|Graph showing the rise in global sea level (in mm) as measured by the NASA/CNES oceanic altimeter TOPEX/Poseidon (left) and its follow-on mission Jason-1.The study of seamounts has been stymied for a long time by the lack of technology. Although seamounts have been sampled as far back as the 19th century, their depth and position meant that the technology to explore and sample seamounts in sufficient detail did not exist until the last few decades. Even with the right technology available, only a scant 1% of the total number have been explored,( and sampling and information remains biased towards the top .( New species are observed or collected and valuable information is obtained on almost every submersible dive at seamounts.()Before seamounts and their oceanographic impact can be fully understood, they must be mapped, a daunting task due to their sheer number.( The most detailed seamount mappings are provided by multibeam echosounding (sonar), however after more than 5000 publicly held cruises, the amount of the sea floor that has been mapped remains minuscule. Satellite altimetry is a broader alternative, albeit not as detailed, with 13,000 catalogued seamounts; however this is still only a fraction of the total 100,000. The reason for this is that uncertainties in the technology limit recognition to features  or larger. In the future, technological advances could allow for a larger and more detailed catalogue.() Deep-sea mining Seamounts are a possible future source of heavy metals. The growth of the human population and, with it, heavy industry, has pressed demands for Earths finite resources. Even though the ocean makes up 70% of the world, technological challenges with deep-sea mineral mining have severely limited its extent. But with the constantly decreasing supply on land, many see oceanic mining as the destined future, and seamounts stand out as candidates.()Seamounts are abundant, and all have metal resource potential because of various enrichment processes during the seamounts life. Hydrogenic Iron-manganese, hydrothermal oxide, sulfide, sulfate, sulfur, hydrothermal oxide, and phosphorite are all mineral resources that are founded by various processes and deposited upon seamounts. However, only the first two have any potential of being targeted by mining in the next few decades.( Dangers File:US Navy 050127-N-4658L-030 The Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine USS San Francisco (SSN 711) in dry dock to assess damage sustained after running aground approximately 350 miles south of Guam Jan. 8, 2005.jpg|thumb|right|USS San Francisco in dock in Guam in January 2005, following its collision with an uncharted seamount. The damage was extensive and the submarine was just barely salvaged.(Some seamounts have not been mapped and thus pose a navigational danger. For instance, Seamount is named after the ship that hit it in 1973.() More recently, the submarine USS San Francisco ran into an uncharted seamount in 2005 at a speed of , sustaining serious damage and killing one seaman.()One major seamount risk is that often, in the late of stages of their life, extrusions begin to seep in the seamount. This activity leads to inflation, over-extension of the volcanos flanks, and ultimetly flank collapse, leading to submarine landslides with the potential to start major tsunamis. This is one of the largest natural disasters in the world. In an illustration of the potent power of flank collapses, a summit collapse on the northern edge of Seamount resulted in a pronounced headwall scarp and a field of debris up to  away.( A catastrophic collapse at Seamount flattened its whole structure extensively.( Lastly, in 2004, scientists found marine fossils  up the flank of Kohala mountain in Hawaii (island). Subsidation analysis found that at the time of their deposition, this would have been  up the flank of the volcano,() far too high for a normal wave to reach. The date corresponded with a massive flank collapse at the nearby Loa, and it was theorized that it was a massive tsunami, generated by the landslide, that deposited the fossils.()See also* volcano* topographic prominence* of Hawaiian volcanoes* Protected Area* volcano* of submarine volcanoes* eruption* Bathymetry References BibliographyGeology* Keating, B.H., Fryer, P., Batiza, R., Boehlert, G.W.

Black_Country
The Black Country is a loosely defined area of the English Midlands conurbation, to the north and west of (but not inclusive of) Birmingham, and to the south and east of Wolverhampton. During the revolution in the 19th century this area had become one of the most intensely industrialised in the nation. The South Staffordshire coal mines, the coal coking operations, and the iron foundries and mills that used the local coal to fire their furnaces, produced a level of pollution that had few equals anywhere in the world.The Black Country is relatively recent as a concept and identity, the expression deriving from the 1840s.() It is popularly believed that the area got its name because of pollution from these heavy industries that covered the area in black soot. There is an anecdote (of dubious authenticity) about Queen Victoria ordering the blinds lowered on her carriage as the royal train passed through. However, historians suggest that it is more likely that the name existed even before the Revolution; outcroppings of black coal scarred the surface of the local heath, and the presence of coal so near the surface rendered the local soil very black.GeographyThe bounds of the Black Country, however, are controversial, and the whole of Wolverhampton is included by some and not at all by others. A common definition of the Black Country encompasses the three Boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell and Walsall.() The town of Dudley is sometimes referred to as being the Black Countrys (unofficial) capital.()An older, more precise, de facto definition uses geology and follows the outcroppings of the South Staffordshire thick coal seam known locally as the thirty foot seam, as bounded by the eastern and western boundary faults and on the north by the Bentley fault which divides the Staffordshire coalfield from the adjoining Chase coalfield. Near Halesowen and Stourbridge, the coal seams outcropped, providing a southern boundary. The outcropping coal made the soil black over large areas and gave rise to the local name. On this basis parts of Walsall, Wolverhampton and Stourbridge are not part of the Black Country but Bromwich is, although here the thirty foot seam is at relative depth. These delineations are still of importance locally.A useful guide for outsiders is to regard the M5 and motorways as the eastern boundary but this, even using the 21st century definition, is only approximately correct as Smethwick is to the east of it and most of Walsall lies north east of the M6 motorway. The definition is simply wrong using the older geological definition.The Black Country proper has coalesced into a single conurbation, but is unusual in that it has no single centre, having grown up from a number of historic market towns and industrial villages that have coalesced during the 20th century. It remains essentially polyfocal with many of the towns and villages remaining recognisable communities and in some cases resenting having been subsumed into a metropolitan borough whose centre is elsewhere.The Black Country lies wholly within the West Midlands County, but was divided between the ancient counties of Staffordshire and Worcestershire. The ancient parish (and pre-1966 municipal borough) of Dudley was a detached part of Worcestershire within Staffordshire, whilst until 1845, much of the parish of Halesowen, including Oldbury and Warley Salop (but not Cradley or Warley Wigorn) was a detached part of Shropshire.Since 1974, the Black Country has been administered by the four local authories of Dudley, Wolverhampton, Sandwell and Walsall, but had previously consisted of several smaller boroughs and urban districts. In 1966, Dudley took in most of Sedgley and Brierley Hill, while Coseley was split between Dudley and Wolverhampton, which in turn took in Tettenhall, Wednesfield and Bilston. West Bromwich annexed most of Tipton and Wednesbury, while parts of Tipton and Dudley were annexed into the new borough of Warley which mainly consisted of Oldbury, Smethwick and Rowley Regis. Dudley expanded further in 1974 to incorporate Halesowen and Stourbridge, while West Bromwich and Warley merged at this time to form Sandwell.Walsall, on the other hand, took in the neighbouring towns of Darlaston and Willenhall in 1966, and expanded further in 1974 when Aldridge-Brownhills (a district generally not regarded as part of the Black Country) was incorporated into it.The Black Country comprises parts of the towns of Bilston, Blackheath, Hill, Brownhills, Coseley, Cradley, Heath, Darlaston, Dudley, Gornal, Great Bridge, Halesowen, Kingswinford, Lye, Netherton, Oldbury, Hill, End, Port, Bank, Regis, Sedgley, Smethwick, Stourbridge, Tipton, Heath, Walsall, Warley, Wednesbury, Wednesfield, Bromwich, Willenhall and Wordsley. and Bradley(princes end tipton)HistoryIndustrialisation in the Black Country area goes back a long way. It was already an area where metal working was important as far back as the 16th century, due to the presence of ore and of coal in a seam  thick, the thickest seam in Britain, which outcropped in various places. Many people had an agricultural smallholding and supplemented their income by working as nailers or smiths, an example of a phenomenon known to economic historians as proto-industrialisation.In 1642 at the start of the Civil War, Charles I failed to capture the two arsenals of Portsmouth and Hull, which although in cities loyal to Parliament were located in counties loyal to him. As he had failed to capture the arsenals, Charles did not possess any supply of swords, pikes, guns, or shot; all these the Black Country could and did provide. From Stourbridge came shot, from Dudley cannon. The numberless small forges which then existed on every brook in the north of Worcestershire turned out successive supplies of sword blades and pike heads. It was said that among the many causes of anger Charles had against Birmingham was that one of the best sword makers of the day, a man named Porter, who lived and made his blades in Worcestershire, but sold them in Birmingham, refused at any price to supply swords for that man of blood (A Puritan nickname for King Charles), or any of his adherents. As an offset to this sword maker, the Royalists had among their adherents Colonel Dudley, who had invented a means of smelting iron by the use of coke, and who claimed he could turn out all sorts of bar iron fit for making of muskets, carbines, and iron for great bolts, both more cheaply, more speedily and more excellent than could be done in any other way. His method was employed on the Kings behalf.(William Willis-Bund. The Civil War In Worcestershire, 1642-1646: And the Scotch Invasion Of 1615, Birmingham: The Midland Educational Company, ltd., 1905, pp. 4,5,88)(Joan Zuckerman, Geoffrey Eley. The Birmingham heritage, Taylor & Francis, 1979. ISBN 0-85664-875-2, 9780856648755. p. 34)By the 19th century or early 20th century, many villages had their characteristic manufacture, but earlier occupations were less concentrated. Some of these concentrations are less ancient than sometimes supposed. For example, chain making in Cradley Heath seems only to have begun in about the 1820s, and the Lye holloware industry is even more recent.Prior to the Revolution, coal and limestone were worked only on a modest scale for local consumption, but during the Industrial Revolution by the opening of canals, such as the Canal Navigations, Canal and the Canal (the Canal Line No 1 and the Tunnel) opened up the mineral wealth of the area to exploitation. Advances in the use of coke for the production in iron enabled iron production (hitherto limited by the supply of charcoal) to expand rapidly.By Victorian times, the Black Country was one of the most heavily industrialised areas in Britain, and it became known for its pollution, particularly from iron and coal industries and their many associated smaller businesses. This led to the expansion of local railways and coal mine lines. The line running from Stourbridge to Walsall via Port and Wednesbury closed in the 1960s, but the Birmingham to Wolverhampton line via Tipton is still a major transport route.The anchors and chains for the ill-fated liner RMS Titanic were manufactured in the Black Country in the area of Netherton. Three anchors and accompanying chains were manufactured; and the set weighed in at 100 tons. The centre anchor alone weighed 12 tons and was pulled through Netherton on its journey to the ship by 20 horses.The area soon gained notoriety. Dickenss novel Old Curiosity Shop, written in 1841, described how the areas local factory chimneys Poured out their plague of smoke, obscured the light, and made foul the melancholy air. In 1862, Burritt, the American Consul in Birmingham, described the region as black by day and red by night, because of the smoke and grime generated by the intense manufacturing activity and the glow from furnaces at night. Early 20th Century representations of the region can be found in the Mercian novels of Francis Brett Young, most notably Brother Jonathan(1928).It is said that R. R. Tolkien based the grim region of Mordor on the heavily industrialised Black Country area in his famed novel Lord of the Rings. Indeed, in the Elvish Sindarin language, Mor-Dor means Dark (or Black) Land, and is sometimes even referred to within the novel as The Black Country.The 20th century saw a decline in coal mining in the Black Country, with the last colliery in the region - Colliery near Sedgley - closing on 2 March 1968, marking the end of an era after some 300 years of mass coal mining in the region, though a small number of open cast mines remained in use for a few years afterwards.()The Black Country todayright|thumb|The Black Country TartanThe heavy industry which once dominated the Black Country has now largely gone. The 20th century saw a decline in coalmining and the industry finally came to an end in 1968 with the closure of Baggeridge Colliery near Sedgley. Clean air legislation has meant that the Black Country is no longer black. The area still maintains some manufacturing, but on a much smaller scale than historically. Chainmaking is still a viable industry in the Cradley Heath area where the majority of the chain for the of Defence and the Admiralty fleet is made in modern factories. Much but not all of the area now suffers from high unemployment and parts of it are amongst the most economically deprived communities in the UK. This is particularly true in parts of the boroughs of Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton. According to the Governments 2007 Index of Deprivation (ID 2007), Sandwell is the third most deprived authority in the West Midlands region, after Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent, and the 14th most deprived of the UKs 354 districts. Wolverhampton is the fourth most deprived district in the West Midlands, and the 28th most deprived nationally. Walsall is the fifth most deprived district in the West Midlands region, and the 45th most deprived in the country.Dudley fares better, but still has pockets of deprivation. Overall Dudley is the 100th most deprived district of the UK, but the second most affluent of the seven metropolitan districts of the West Midlands, with Solihull coming top.As with many urban areas in the UK, there is also a significant ethnic minority population in parts: in Sandwell, 22.6 per cent of the population are from ethnic minorities, and in Wolverhampton the figure is 23.5 per cent. However, in Walsall 84.6 per cent of the population is described as white, while in Dudley 92 per cent of the population is white. Resistance to mass immigration in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s led to the slogan Keep the Black Country white!.The Black Country suffered its biggest economic blows in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when unemployment soared largely because of the closure of historic large factories including the Round Oak Steel Works at Hill and the Patent Shaft steel plant at Wednesbury. Unemployment rose drastically across the country during this period as part of prime minister Margaret Thatchers battle against inflation as well as the modernisation process of Britains industrial climate, but these areas were designated as Enterprise Zones and within a few years had been redeveloped. Round Oak and the surrounding farmland was developed as the Merry Hill Shopping Centre and Waterfront commercial and leisure complex, while the Patent Shaft site was developed as an industrial estate.The Country Living Museum in Dudley recreates life in the Black Country in the early 20th century, and is a popular attraction.Evidence of this are begging to grow once again can be found in the fact that a new Jaguar-Land Rover factory is set to be built near Wolverhampton. The Black Country now has its own tartan, designed by Philip Tibbetts from Halesowen.(Black Country gets its own tartan NEWS, January 12, 2009)(Reference: WR3278 Scottish Tartan World Register)Black Country dialectIn common with most parts of the UK, the extent to which the Black country accent and dialect are used varies from person to person and across the Black Country itself, with some elements of the dialect being stronger in some towns than others.  Local dialect was, and probably still is to a lesser degree quite distinctive between the different towns and villages of the Black Country. Although most outsiders to the Black Country cannot tell this difference, Black Country folk can quite fiercely defend the difference between the accents.  Thus while a single example of Black Country dialect is hard to give, as different areas of the Black Country differ with colloquialisms, examples include babby for baby, alf baerked for stupid, argy-bargy for fight and bostin to mean very good.The word endings with en are still noticeable in conversation as in gooen for going, callen  for calling. The vowel a is pronounced as o as in sond for sand, hond for hand, opple for apple, sponner for spanner, and mon for man. Other pronunciations are winder for window, fer for far, and loff for laugh.() The traditional Black Country dialect preserves many archaic traits of Modern English and even English,(Staff and Agencies Wolverhampton researches Black Country dialect Unlimited, January 27, 2003) and can be very confusing for outsiders. Thee, Thy and Thou are still in use, as is the case in parts of Yorkshire and Lancashire. Ow Bist, meaning How are you? is a greeting possibly contracted from How be it with thou?, with the typical answering being Bay too bah, meaning I am not too bad contracted from I be not too bad. I havent seen her becomes I ay sid er. Black Country dialect often uses ar where other parts of England use yes (this is common as far away as Yorkshire). Similarly, the local version of you is pronounced  , rhyming with now.  The local pronunciation goo (elsewhere go) or gooin is similar to that elsewhere in the Midlands. It is quite common for broad Black Country speakers to say agooin where others say going. Despite the close proximity, many inhabitants of the Black Country resist hints at any relationship to people living in Birmingham, which may be called Brum-a-jum (Birminghams colloquial name is Brummagem, a corruption of its older name of Bromwicham(The Church Wardens Book of St Johns Parish Church, Halesowen, includes an early reference to an amount paid to the organ builder of Bromwicham.) and hence West Bromwich) or Birminam (missing the g and h out and saying it the way its spelt). Residents of Birmingham (Brummies) meanwhile often refer to their Black Country neighbours as Yam Yams, a reference to the use of Yow am ( or yowm) instead of You are.The dialects perception was boosted in 2008, due to an internet video, The Black Country Alphabet, which described the whole alphabet in Black Country speak.() Yet this in itself is quite misleading as a quality example of the dialect. For example, ow am ya? is mainly used in the Wolverhampton area of the Black Country, which is only a small portion of the area, while ow bin ya? is used by most.thumb|A 1997 roadsign written in Black Country dialect.A road sign containing local dialect was placed at the A461/A459/A4037 junction in 1997 before the construction of a traffic island on the site. The sign read, in translation, If youre  soft enough (stupid) to come down here on your way home, your tea (supper) will be spoilt.()() This island was completed in 1998 and was the first phase of the Southern By-Pass which was opened on 15 October 1999.MediaThe Black Country is home to three radio stations - Radio, Gold and 102.5 The Bridge, while the city of Wolverhampton has its own local station called The Wolf. Both Beacon and Gold (formerly Radio WABC) have broadcast since 1976 from transmitter sites from Hill in neighbouring Regis, with the studios being located in Wolverhampton. 102.5 The Bridge has broadcast since 2008 and its studios are based in Stourbridge.The and Star is one of the regions two daily newspapers, publishing eleven local editions from its Wolverhampton headquarters and its five district offices (for example the Dudley edition is considerably different in content from the Wolverhampton or Stafford editions). It is the biggest selling regional paper in the UK.() Incidentally the Express and Star, traditionally a Black Country paper has expanded to the point where they sell copies from vendors in Birmingham city centre.The Black Country Mail - a local edition of the Mail - is the regions other daily newspaper. Its regional base is in Walsall town centre. Established in 1973, from a site in High Street, Heath, the Country Bugle has also contributed to the regions past history. It started as a fortnightly publication, but due to its widespread appeal, now appears on a weekly basis.Recently the Black Country Alphabet and Black Country Christmas Song by the Black Country Tee-Shirts company have helped to demonstrate the accent and dialect further across the country. In September 2009 a group of Black Country film-makers showcased a variety of video poems about the area and its cultural identity (Known collectively as Black Country Cinema). The films were exhibited at Wolverhamptons House Media Centre. Local film and digital media agency Screen West Midlands referred to the event as Personal, Instinctual & Organic Video Poetry of everyday life.() The event was a way of embracing the Black Countrys distinctive cultural characteristics in the medium of film.See also*Noir, industriel, Diamond similar early industrialising regions of Belgium and the Netherlands.ReferencesFurther reading* Raybould, T.J.

website          The World Economic Forum (WEF) is a Swiss non-profit foundation, based in Cologny, Geneva, best known for its annual meeting in Davos, a mountain resort in Graubnden, in the eastern Alps region of Switzerland. The meeting brings together top business leaders, international political leaders, selected intellectuals and journalists to discuss the most pressing issues facing the world, including health and the environment.  Beside meetings, the foundation produces a series of research reports and engages its members in sector specific initiatives.(Pigman. pp. 41&ndash;42.)  It also organizes the Annual Meeting of the New Champions in China and a series of regional meetings throughout the year. In 2008, those regional meetings included meetings on Europe and Central Asia, East Asia, the Russia CEO Roundtable, Africa, the Middle East, and the World Economic Forum on Latin America. In 2008, the foundation also launched the Summit on the Global Agenda in Dubai.  The 2011 annual meeting in Davos has been held from 26 January to 30 January.HistoryThe foundation was founded in 1971 by Schwab, a German-born business professor at the of Geneva.(Pigman. pp. 6&ndash;22.) Originally named the European Management Forum, it changed its name to the World Economic Forum in 1987 and sought to broaden its vision further to include providing a platform for resolving international conflicts.In the summer of 1971, Schwab invited 444 executives from European firms to the first Management Symposium held in the Congress Centre under the patronage of the Commission and European industrial associations, where Schwab sought to introduce European firms to American management practices. He then founded the WEF as a non-profit organization based in Geneva and drew European business leaders to Davos for the annual meetings each January.(Kellerman. p. 229.)Schwab developed the stakeholder management approach which based corporate success on managers taking account of all interests: not merely shareholders, clients and customers, but also employees and the communities within which the firm is situated, including governments.(Schwab and Kroos.) Events in 1973, including the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed-exchange rate mechanism and the War, saw the annual meeting expand its focus from management to economic and social issues, and political leaders were invited for the first time to the annual meeting in January 1974.( Interview: Klaus Schwab.Times. 22 January 2008.

The Declaration was signed in 1988 by Greece and Turkey, helping them turn back from the brink of war. In 1992, South African President W. de Klerk met with Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi at the annual meeting, their first joint appearance outside South Africa. At the 1994 annual meeting, Israeli Foreign Minister Peres and PLO Chairman Arafat reached a draft agreement on Gaza and Jericho.(Lowe, Felix (14 January 2008).  WEF and Davos: A Brief History. The Telegraph. Retrieved 25 January 2011.) In 2008, Gates gave a keynote speech on capitalism, a form of capitalism that works both to generate profits and solve the worlds inequities, using market forces to better address the needs of the poor.( )()OrganizationHeadquartered in Cologny, the foundation opened, in 2006, regional offices in Beijing, China; and York City, York, United States. It strives to be impartial, and is not tied to any political, partisan or national interests.  The foundation is committed to improving the State of the World,(Pigman. pp. 58&ndash;59.) and has status with the Nations Economic and Social Council, and is under the supervision of the Federal Council. The foundations highest governance body is the Foundation Board consisting of 22 members.During the five-day annual meeting in 2009, over 2,500 participants from 91 countries gathered in Davos. Around 75 percent (1,170) were business leaders, drawn principally from its members, 1,000 of the worlds top companies. Besides these, participants included 219 public figures, including 40 heads of state or government, 64 cabinet ministers, 30 heads or senior officials of international organizations and 10 ambassadors. More than 432 participants were from civil society, including 32 heads or representatives of non-governmental organizations, 225 media leaders, 149 leaders from academic institutions and think tanks, 15 religious leaders of different faiths and 11 union leaders.()MembershipThe foundation is funded by its 1,000-member companies, the typical company being a global enterprise with more than five billion dollars in turnover, although the latter can vary by industry and region. In addition, these enterprises rank among the top companies within their industry and/or country and play a leading role in shaping the future of their industry and/or region. As of 2005, each member company pays a basic annual membership fee of CHF 42,500 and a CHF 18,000 annual-meeting fee which covers the participation of its executive officer at the annual meeting.  Industry Partners and Strategic Partners pay CHF 250,000 and CHF 500,000, respectively, allowing them to play a greater role in the foundations initiatives.(Pigman. pp. 23&ndash;30.)(Rothkopf. p. 272.)In addition, these enterprises rank among the top companies within their industry and/or country (generally based on turnover in millions of U.S. dollars; for financial institutions, the criteria is based on assets) and play a leading role in shaping the future of their industry and/or region, as judged by the foundations selection committee.Industry Partners come from a broad range of business sectors, including construction; aviation; technology; tourism; food and beverage; engineering; and financial services. These companies are alert to the global issues that most affect their specific industry sector.ActivitiesAnnual meeting in DavosImage:Gordon Brown, Queen Rania - WEF Annual Meeting Davos 2008.jpg|thumb|Brown, then-Minister of the United Kingdom, and Rania of Jordan at the 2008 annual meeting.Image:World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Khatami, of Iran (1997&ndash;2005) attending the workspace session Rules for a Global Neighbourhood in a Multicultural World at the Annual Meeting 2007 of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, 25 January 2007.The flagship event of the foundation is the invitation-only annual meeting held every year at the end of January in Davos, bringing together chief executive officers from its 1,000-member companies as well as selected politicians, representatives from academia, NGOs, religious leaders and the media in an alpine environment. The town is small enough to enforce participants to meet anywhere off the sessions and allows them to attend the most possible receptions organized by companies and countries.(writer (26 January 2009).

The meeting also engages with the next generation of global leaders, fast-growing regions, competitive cities and technology pioneers from around the globe.()() Wen Jiabao has delivered a plenary address at each annual meeting.Regional meetingsEvery year ten regional meetings take place, enabling close contact between corporate business leaders, local government leaders and NGOs. Meetings are held in Africa, Asia, America and the East The mix of hosting countries varies from year to year, but China and India have hosted consistently over the past decade.()To commemorate 20th anniversary of the World Economic Forum on East Asia meeting will be held in Jakarta, Indonesia on June 12 and 13, 2011 with topic Responding to the New Globalism. Some of the participants have confirmed attendance such as World Customs Organization Secretary General from Brussels, Unilever CEO from London and PricewaterhouseCoopers chairman from the US.

The Open Forum has been held in the local high school every year, featuring top politicians and business leaders, and is open to all members of the public free of charge.(Pigman. p. 130.)()The annual meeting has also been decried as a mix of pomp and platitude, and criticized for moving away from serious economics and accomplishing little of substance, particularly with the increasing involvement of NGOs that have little or no expertise in economics. Instead of a discussion on the world economy with knowledgeable experts alongside key business and political players, the annual meeting now features the top media political causes of the day, such as global climate change and AIDS in Africa.()Davos ManDavos Man is a neologism which refers to the global elite of wealthy men whose members view themselves as completely international.  Davos is an Alpine city in eastern Switzerland which became famous in the 1990s for hosting the World Economic Forum, an annual gathering of international politicians and financiers who represented a transnational elite. It is similar to the term Masters of the Universe attributed to influential financiers on Wall St.Davos Men supposedly see their identity as a matter of personal choice, not an accident of birth. According to political scientist P. Huntington, who is credited with inventing the phrase Davos Man,(Timothy Garton Ash. Davos mans death wish, The Guardian, 3 February 2005) they are people who have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the lites global operations. In his 2004 article Dead Souls: The Denationalization of the American Elite, he argues that this international perspective is a minority elitist position not shared by the nationalist majority of the people.(Samuel Huntington. Dead Souls: The Denationalization of the American Elite, National Interest, Spring 2004)John Fonte of the Institute has suggested that the transnational ideology of Davos Man represents a major challenge to Fukuyamas assertion that democracy represents the fulfillment of End of History and the Last Man.(http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/transnational_progressivism.pdf)de Soto Polar of the for Liberty and Democracy attributes a similar concept to Henri Braudel, referring to it as the bell jar. Although internationally connected, each countrys elite lives in a bell jar in the sense of being out of touch with its own populace. Their isolation fosters a tendency to be oblivious to the fate of their fellow citizens.(Hernando de Soto. The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else.

The corridor along the Gan River is one of the few easily traveled routes through the otherwise mountainous and rugged terrain of the south-eastern mountains. This open corridor was the primary route for trade and communication between the China Plain and the River valley in the north and the territory of modern Guangdong province in the south. As a result Jiangxi has been strategically important throughout much of Chinas history.Jiangxi was outside the sphere of influence of early Chinese civilization during the Dynasty (16th to 11th centuries BC). It is likely that peoples collectively known as the Baiyue inhabited the region. During the and Autumn Period, the northern part of modern Jiangxi formed the western frontier of the state of Wu. After Wu was conquered by the state of Yue (a power based in modern northern Zhejiang) in 473 BC, the state of Chu (based in modern Hubei) took over northern Jiangxi and there may have been some Yue influence in the south. Chu subjugated Yue in 333 BC. In 223 BC, when Qin conquered Chu, majority of Jiangxi area was recorded to be put under Jiujiang Commandary situated in Shouchun ().(http://218.65.88.149:8080/was40/detail?record1&primarykeyvalue%E9%A2%98%E5%90%8D%3D%E8%B1%AB%E7%AB%A0%E6%95%85%E9%83%A1&channelid7274) However the commandary was ineffective and ended shortly when Qin falls.commandery (, Gan: -zong) was established in Jiangxi at the beginning of the Dynasty, possibly before the death of Yu in 202 BC, and its also the very first commandery set up by Chinese dynasty in Jiangxi. It was named after the Yuzhang River (, Gan: -zong Kong), the original name of Gan River. Gan has become the abbreviation of the province. In 201, eight counties were added to the original seven of Qin, and three more were established in later years. Throughout most of the Han Dynasty the commanderys eighteen counties covered most of the modern province of Jiangxi. The county seats of Nanchang, Gan, Yudu, Luling among others were located at the sites of modern major cities. Other counties, however, have been moved or abolished in later centuries.Under the reign of Emperor Wu of the Dynasty, Yuzhang Commandery was assigned to Province, as part of a trend to establish provinces (zhou) all across China. In 291 AD, during the Jin Dynasty, Jiangxi became its own Zhou called Jiangzhou (, Gan: Kong-chiu). During the and Southern Dynasties, Jiangxi was under the control of the southern dynasties, and the number of zhou slowly grew.During the Dynasty, there were seven commanderies and twenty-four counties in Jiangxi. During the Dynasty, another commandery and fourteen counties were added. Commanderies were then abolished, becoming zhou (henceforth translated as prefectures rather than provinces).Circuits were established during the Dynasty as a new top-level administrative division. At first Jiangxi was part of the Circuit (lit. Circuit south of the Yangtze). In 733, this circuit was divided into western and eastern halves. Jiangxi was found in the western half, which was called Circuit (lit. Western circuits south of the Yangtze). This is the source of the modern name Jiangxi.The Dynasty collapsed in 907, heralding the division of the Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Jiangxi first belonged to Wu (, Gan: Ng), then to Tang (, Gan: Nm-thng). Both states were based in modern-day Nanjing, further down the River.During the Dynasty, Jiangnanxi Circuit was reestablished with nine prefectures and four army districts (with sixty-eight districts).During the Dynasty, the circuit was divided into thirteen different circuits, and Jiangxi Province was established for the first time. This province also included the majority of modern Guangdong. Jiangxi acquired (more or less) its modern borders during the Dynasty after Guangdong was separated out. There has been little change to the borders of Jiangxi since.After the fall of the Qing Dynasty, Jiangxi became one of the earliest bases for the Communists and many peasants were recruited to join the growing peoples revolution. The Uprising took place in Jiangxi on August 1, 1927, during the Civil War. Later the Communist leadership hid in the mountains of southern and western Jiangxi, hiding from the Kuomindangs attempts to eradicate them. In 1931, the Soviet Republics government was established in Ruijin (, Gan: Su-kim), which is sometimes called the Former Red Capital (, Gan: Fng-set K-tu), or just the Red Capital. In 1935, after complete encirclement by the Nationalist forces, the Communists broke through and began the March to Yanan.GeographyMountains surround Jiangxi on three sides, with the Mountains, Mountains, and Mountains on the west; Mountains and Mountains on the east; and the Mountains and Mountains in the south. The southern half of the province is hilly with ranges and valleys interspersed; while the northern half is flatter and lower in altitude. The highest point in Jiangxi is Huanggang in the Mountains, on the border with Fujian. It has an altitude of 2157 m.The Gan River dominates the province, flowing through the entire length of the province from south to north. It enters Poyang in the north, the largest freshwater lake of China; that lake in turn empties into the River, which forms part of the northern border of Jiangxi. Important reservoirs include the Tuolin Reservoir in the northwest of the province on the River, and the Wanan Reservoir(zh) in the upper section of the Gan.Jiangxis climate is subtropical. Average temperatures are about 3 to 9C in January and 27 to 31C in July. Annual precipitation is 1200 to 1900 mm.Nanchang, the regions capital and the most densely populated city, is one of Chinas largest metropolis. Nanchang is the hub of Jiangxi civilization throughout its history, which plays a leading role in the commercial, intellectual and industrial and political fields.(www.china.com.cn) While Ganzhou is the largest subdivision of Jiangxi.Major cities:* Nanchang* Jiujiang* Jian* Pingxiang* Jingdezhen* Ganzhou* Yingtan* FuzhouAdministrative divisionsJiangxi is divided into eleven prefecture-level divisions, all cities:The eleven prefecture-level divisions of Jiangxi are subdivided into 99 county-level divisions (19 districts, ten cities, and 70 counties). Those in turn are divided into 1548 township-level divisions (770 towns, 651 townships, seven townships, and 120 subdistricts).See of administrative divisions of Jiangxi for a complete list of county-level divisions.PoliticsThe Politics of Jiangxi is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.The of Jiangxi is the highest ranking official in the Peoples Government of Jiangxi. However, in the provinces dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Jiangxi Party of China Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the Jiangxi Party Chief.EconomyRice is the dominant crop in Jiangxi. Cash crops commonly grown include cotton and rapeseed. Jiangxi is the leading producer  producer of kumquats in China, particularly County.()Jiangxi is rich in mineral resources, leading the provinces of China in deposits of copper, tungsten, gold, silver, uranium, thorium, tantalum, niobium, among others. Noted centers of mining include Dexing (copper) and County (tungsten).Jiangxi is a rather poor province when compared to its neighboring provinces. It is located in extreme proximity to some of the richest provinces of China (Guangdong, Zhejiang, Fujian), which are sometimes blamed for taking away talent and capital from Jiangxi.Jiangxis nominal GDP for 2009 was 765 billion yuan (112.1 billion USD) and a per capita of 17,248 RMB (2,525USD).Economic and Technological Development Zones*Nanchang Export Processing ZoneNanchang National Export Expressing Zone is located in NanChang Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone, it was approved by the State Council on May 8, 2006, and passed the national acceptance inspection on Sep 7th, 2007.

NCHDZ possesses unique nature condition and sound industry foundation of accepting electronics industry. NCHDZ has brought 25% industrial added value and 50% industrial benefit and tax to Nanchang city by using only 0.4% land area.(RightSite.asia | Nanchang High-Tech Industrial Development Zone)*Nanchang Economic and Technological Development Zone(RightSite.asia | Nanchang Economic & Technological Development Zone)DemographicsThe population of Jiangxi is approximately 39.66 million.()  99.73% of that is Chinese, predominantly Gan and Hakka. Ganzhou, Jiangxis largest city, has an especially large number of Hakka. Ethnic minorities include Hui and Zhuang.Jiangxi and Henan both have the most unbalanced gender ratios of all Chinese provinces.  Based on a 2009 Medical Journal study, the ratio is over 140 boys for every 100 girls in the 1-4 age group.http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b1211.fullCulturethumb|Porcelain workshop in Jingdezhen.Jiangxi is the main area of concentration of the Gan varieties of Chinese, spoken over most of the northern two-thirds of the province. Examples include the dialect, dialect and dialect. The southern one-third of the province speaks Hakka. There are also Mandarin, Huizhou, and Wu dialects spoken along the northern border.Ganju (Jiangxi opera) is the type of opera performed in Jiangxi.Although little known outside of the province, cuisine is rich and distinctive.  Flavors are some of the strongest in China, with heavy use of peppers and especially pickled and fermented products.Jingdezhen is widely regarded as the producer of the best porcelain in China.Jiangxi also was a historical center of Buddhism.Prominent examples of architecture can be found in Jiangxi.TransportationThe 947-km Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway () connects Hangzhou and Zhuzhou (), Hunan.Tourismright|thumb|The mountain peaks of Lushan National Park.Near the northern port city of Jiujiang lies the well-known resort area of Lushan. Also near the city are the Donglin (East Wood) Temple  and the Tiefo (Iron Buddha) Temple (), two important Buddhist temples.Near the small city of Yingtan is the resort area of Longhushan, which purports to be the birthplace of Taoism and hence has great symbolic value to Taoists.  The region has many temples, cave complexes, mountains and villages. It is considered by many to be the best-kept secret of Jiangxi tourism.The National Park has been a UNESCO Heritage Site since 1996.In 2007, Jiangxi (specifically the Reservoir, about  from Nanchang) was the filming location for the fifteenth series of the American TV show Survivor.Flora and faunaThe mountainous terrain and large forest coverage of Jiangxi has made it historically one of the more wild places of central China. China Tigers have been seen as recently as fifteen or twenty years ago and projects are underway to document evidence of existing tigers, if there are any. Several mountain areas along the northern border with Hunan and Hubei are potential sites for wilderness preserves specifically for protecting or even reintroducing tigers.Other wildlife, though not plentiful, are more numerous in Jiangxi than in many other developed areas of China. Numerous species of birds are common, especially around the marshes of Lake Poyang in the north. Though protected, mammals such as muntjak, wild boar, civet cats, and pangolins, are still common enough that theyll even occasionally be seen in markets for sale as game meat, or possibly even in a forest.The late Paleocene mesonychid, chaotoensis was found in the province, and named after it.EducationColleges and universities* Ceramic Institute* Financial and Economic College* China Institute of Technology* China Jiaotong University* University* Normal University* Science and Technology Normal University* University* University of Finance and Economics* Teachers College* Institute of Education* Agricultural University* Institute of TechnologyTwinnings* Bohol, Philippines* Kentucky, USA* Grosso do Sul, Brazil(http://www.noticias.ms.gov.br/index.php?templatvis&site136&id_comp1068&id_reg85352&voltarhome&site_reg136&id_comp_orig1068)NotesReferences*Economic profile for Jiangxi at HKTDCExternal links* Jiangxi Government website* ace:Jiangxiar:bn:zh-min-nan:Kang-sai-sngbo:bg:ca:Jiangxics:iang-sicy:Jiangxida:Jiangxide:Jiangxiet:Jiangxiel:es:Jiangxieo:jangioeu:Jiangxifa:fr:Jiangxiga:Jiangxigv:Jiangxigan:hak:Kng-shi:id:Jiangxiit:Jiangxihe:pam:Jiangxika:sw:Jiangxilt:Dziangsihu:Csianghszimr:ms:Jiangxinl:Jiangxija:no:Jiangxinn:Jiangxipl:Jiangxipt:Jiangxiro:Jiangxiru:simple:Jiangxisr:fi:Jiangxisv:Jiangxitl:Jiangxith:uk:Tywar:Jiangxizh-yue:zh:

West_Coast_Region
The West Coast () is one of the administrative regions of New Zealand, located on the west coast of the Island, and is one of the more remote and most sparsely populated areas of the country. It is made up of three districts: Buller, Grey and Westland. The principal towns are Westport, Greymouth and Hokitika.Naming* To New Zealanders, The Coast generally refers to the West Coast of the Island, and Coasters to those that live there.(West Coast  Regional Information (from New Zealand Tourism Online website))(The West Coast New Zealand (from A New Zealand Travel Guide website))* Westland is used by some New Zealanders to refer to the whole of the West Coast, including District, District, and Fiordland,   and can also refer to the short-lived Province of 187376.* Fiordland is geographically on the west coast of New Zealand but has no direct road connection, and is in the Southland rather than West Coast administrative region.Geographythumb|left|200px| A map showing population density in the West Coast Region at the 2006 census.The West Coast region reaches from Point in the north to Point in the south, a distance of 600 km.  To the west is the Sea (which like the Ocean is known to be very rough, with 4 metre swells being common), and to the east are the Alps. Much of the land is rugged, although there are coastal plains around which much of the population resides. The land is very scenic, with wild coastlines, mountains, and a very high proportion of native bush, much of it native temperate forest. The West Coast is the only part of New Zealand where significant tracts of lowland forest remain-elsewhere, for instance on the Plains and in the of Thames, they have been almost completely destroyed for settlement and agriculture. Scenic areas include the Pass, Fox and Josef Glaciers, the Pancake Rocks at Punakaiki and the Track.The region has a very high rainfall due to the prevailing northwesterly wind pattern and the location of the Southern Alps  these two elements give rise to heavy orographic precipitation. The flip side to this is the shadow effect which is responsible for the relatively arid climate of the Canterbury Plains on the other side of the Southern Alps.The regions area is 23,000 km. It is divided into the three districts of Buller, Grey and Westland.EconomyThe sub-national GDP of the West Coast region was estimated at US$779 million in 2003, 1% of New Zealands national GDP.()HistoryFile:Dillman Town.jpg|thumb|270px|Dillmanstown, a gold mining town on the West Coast.The West Coast was home to Mori, who valued it for the taonga of greenstone (pounamu) which was found there in abundance. The West Coast was only occasionally visited by early Europeans until the discovery of gold near the Taramakau River in 1864 by two Mori, Ihaia Tainui and Haimona Taukau.  By the end of the year there were an estimated 1800 prospectors on the West Coast, many of them around the Hokitika area, which, in 1866, became briefly the most populous settlement in New Zealand.The present-day region of the West Coast was divided between Province and Province from 1853, but in 1873 the Canterbury portion of the region formed its own province, the Province, until the abolition of the provincial system in 1876.The Coast Gold Rush between 1864 and 1867 created numerous gold rush towns such as Okarito which at one time was the largest town on the West Coast but then quickly almost vanished as miners moved on. After that time, the population dwindled, but the main towns that still exist on the coast had become established.Following pounamu and gold, the next mineral to make the West Coast valuable was coal. Discovered near the River in the mid 1840s, mining began in earnest during the 1860s. By the 1880s, coal had become the regions main industry, with mines throughout the northern half of the region, especially around Westport. Many of these continued in operation until the mid 20th century, and several survive today. Timber has also long been a major industry in the region, although in recent years there has been an uneasy balance between forestry for wood and forestry for conservation. Much of the region is public land administered by the Department of Conservation and the region has some of the best remaining stands of native forest, along with a wealth of rare wildlife. Ecotourism is now an important industry in the region, and this goes hand in hand with the conservation efforts.HabitationHumanthumb|right|270px|Typical rugged coastline of the West Coast.thumb|right|270px|Typical weather of the West Coast.The region is sparsely populated, especially in the south, with the 2006 census recording 31,326 inhabitants, up from 30,303 in 2001, although not as high as the 1996 figure.Major towns on the West Coast are Greymouth, Westport, and Hokitika. At one time, during the gold rush days, Hokitika had a population of more than 25,000 and boasted more than 100 pubs. A recreation of an early New Zealand settlement can be found at Shantytown. Industries on the West Coast include mining for coal and alluvial gold, forestry and wood processing, and also fishing (including whitebaiting), tourism and farming. Dairy farming has grown strongly  the local dairy co-operative Milk Products remained independent when most others merged to form Fonterra in 2001.Other industries are the manufacturing and sales of greenstone jewellery, sphagnum moss gathering and stone-collection for garden landscaping. The West Coast also has one of the strongest growing regional economies of New Zealand, as of 2007,(History (from the District Council website)) though from a rather small base.The West Coast has been numbered amongst the Top 10 Coastal Drives of the World by Planet.(http://www.westcoastnz.com)Flora and faunaThe West Coast is also notable for being the only New Zealand nesting place of the White Heron / Kotuku, which nests near the Lagoon and can be visited from tours operating out of the small farming township of Whataroa.

Anshan,_Liaoning
footnotes              nshn (; lit. saddle mountain) is the third largest level city in Liaoning province of China. Situated in the central area of the province, Anshan is about 92 km south of Shenyang, the provinces capital. Anshan is on the boundary between the Mountains of eastern Liaoning and the plains of the west. The prefecture has a population of 3,584,000 people and covers an area of about 9,252 square kilometres. The distance from the east to the west of the prefecture is 133 kilometres. The area contains the famous Qinshn National Park. The citys name is derived from the shape of a nearby mountain that resembles the shape of a horses saddle, which can be seen on the left (west) about five minutes before the northbound train arrives at Anshan Station. Anshan is home to the Iron and Steel Group, one of the largest steel producers in China.Anshan has a population of 3.65 million at the 2010 census. Anshan holds one third of the worlds supply of talcum ( ) Anshan holds a quarter of the worlds reserves of magnesite( Anshan also produced the largest ever jade stone, now a local tourist attraction carved as a Buddha.(The built up area encompassing 4 Anshan urban districts (1,529,350 inhabitants) and urban Liaoyang is home to more than 2.17 million inhabitants in 2010.Administratives divisionsAnshan is divided into 4 districts, 1 town , 1 county and one autonomous county.GeographySited on the edge of the River plains, Anshan has wide flat lands in the west and central regions that develop into hilly and the mountainous terrain on the eastern fringes. The area is rich in mineral wealth including iron ore, coal, magnesite, talcum and jade. The plains of western Anshan are good for agriculture. The large flat fields make it ideal for modern agricultural methods. In total, Anshan contains 24480 hectares of arable land accounting for 26.4% of the total land area. One agricultural product that Anshan has become well known for is the production of Nangua Pears.Anshan has no river or sea port. The nearest commercial airport is Taoxian International Airport (SHE), about 90 km to the north. The city is beside the highway () which runs between Shenyang and Dalian (the two larger cities of Liaoning province). This is a privately funded eight-lane tolled highway and was the first road of its kind in China. Anshan is also connected to the Chinese rail network with rail routes to Beijing, Dalian, and to the north-eastern provinces of Jilin and Hilngjing as well as to eastern Inner Mongolia and Russia. Long-distance coaches run to all the main cities of the province as well as to Beijing.Local transportation is primarily by bus or taxi. Anshan used to have a single tram line along Zhonghua Avenue but this has been closed and the tracks removed. Due to the flat topography of the city centre, bicycles are popular. Almost all roads have a wide cycle lane on each side. Often this lane is further protected by a traffic island that separates the bikes from larger motor vehicles.ClimateAnshan has four distinct seasons. General speaking, the weather is dry and sunshine is abundant.**Spring (March to May) with a lot of windy days; less rainy days than summer; long time sunshine and low humidity.**Summer (June to August) with heavy and frequent rain; high temperature around +30C and high humidity.**Autumn (September to October) with clear sky and cool air; temperature drops abruptly; wind from north gets heavier.**Winter (November to middle of March next year) with snow and ice. The average temperature is around -20C. Temperature turns back as time passes.HistoryThe area of Anshan has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The area remained of little significance, a small city in Liaodong province, overshadowed by neighbouring Liaoyang city, until the mid 20th Century. In 1587 Anshan was fortified by the Dynasty to combat the growing power of the Manchu. The city was burnt down during the Rebellion, and was destroyed again in the War (19041905). As a result of this war, Japan had gained influence in Liaoning and was engaged in industrialising the region. Anshan lay beside the new Manchuria Railway line that ran from the port of Dalian to the major city of Shenyang. As a joint Sino-Japanese venture, Anshan Zhenzing Iron Ore Company Unlimited was started in Anshan in 1918. After the Incident in 1931, Japan occupied the northeast of China. The mills were turned into a Japanese owned monopoly. In 1933, the site was expanded to include steel production and the company was renamed Steel Works.(Yoshihisa Tak Matsusaka, The Making of Japanese Manchuria, 1904-1932 (2001), p.222-3.) Anshan became part of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. Additional industries developed around the iron and steel mills. The city of Anshan grew significantly in size around this new industrial site.Anshan had become one of the largest producers of iron and steel in Asia if not the world.() It was therefore of strategic importance in the War, and was subject to constant attack by Superfortress bombers of the USAAF. Japanese Army detached the 1st Chutai (unit) of 104th Sentai (squadron) of the Japanese Army Air Force, to Anshan, with other air squadrons for industrial defense purposes. Although this unit was equipped with modern Ki-84 Ia (Manshu Type) Hayate Frank fighters, manufactured by Hikki Seizo KK, the plant suffered heavy damage from the air raids, losing up to 30% of its capacity.()At the end of the war, Soviet Red Army forces launched Operation August Storm, which captured Manchuria form the Japanese. The Soviets looted the ruins of Shwa Steel Works for anything that could be taken back to the Soviet Union. With the defeat of Japan in 1945, Anshan was returned to China along with the rest of Chinese Manchuria. However, peace had not yet arrived. Civil war continued between the Chinese Nationalist Government and the Communist Liberation Army (PLA). The city of Anshan was the scene of one of the battles of this war. The city was liberated by the PLA on February 19th, 1948. A monument in Lieshishan park commemorates the battle.The northeast of China was marked out to become a major industrial centre for the new Peoples Republic of China. Anshan was set to become a key part of this industrial development. The steel mills had been damaged during the wars. In December 1948, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company - also known as Angang - was founded. Production in the newly repaired steel plant resumed on July 9, 1949. The plant was expanded to become the largest steel producer in China. Other industries setup alongside the steel plant including mining for coal, iron and other minerals. This industrial wealth had an environmental cost. The open-hearth furnaces of the steel mill created large amounts of dust and other pollution. Along with its growing reputation as a major steel producer, Anshan was also gaining a reputation as a dirty, smelly town.Anshan became a formal administrative region under the Northeastern Peoples Government (later renamed as the Northeastern Administration Commission) in November, 1949. On March 12, 1953, the city became a municipality under the Central Government direct administration. Haicheng County and Xiuyan County were subordinated to Liaodong Province. Taian County was subordinated to Liaoxi Province. August 22, 1954, the central government decided that Anshan should be administered by Liaoning Province. The State Council confirmed that Anshan should be in charge of Xiuyan County and Haicheng city in 1985.The furnaces of the steel plant were changed in the 1980s to designs which blow oxygen in from the front. This increased the production and also reduced the pollution. In the 1990s, they were additionally altered to blow oxygen in from the top as well. This further increase production and reduced pollution. In December 2000, all three production lines of Anshan Iron and Steel company switched from mould-casting to continuous casting. This new technology has significantly reduced the dust and other pollution in the city. The new plant equipment is also much less labour intensive. This has meant a reduction in the workforce has caused an unemployment problem in the city. A new drive to market Anshan as a tourist destination is hoped to help bolster the cities economy.EconomyThe north east of China is a major industrial zone and Anshan is one of the key sites of the north east. The city is renowned as Chinas capital of iron and steel. Prior to the development of the Iron and Steel industries, Anshan was a relatively small city of little importance. As the steel mills expanded, so to did the city. Spin off industries developed alongside the steel plant making the area a centre of heavy industry.As a joint Sino-Japanese venture, Anshan Zhenzing Iron Ore Company Unlimited was started in Anshan in 1918. When Japan occupied Northeast China in 1931, these mills were turned into a Japanese owned monopoly. Anshan subsequently became part of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo and additional industries developed around the iron and steel mills. Due to its mills, the city became a significant strategic industrial hub during World War II and as such, was subject to constant Allied bombing during the war.()Total production of processed iron in Manchuria reached 1,000,000 tonnes in 1931-32, of which almost half was made by Shwa Steel in Anshan. Iron production grew to 7,000,000 tonnes in 1938 and by 1941, Shwa Steel Works had a total capacity production of 1,750,000 tonnes of iron bars and 1,000,000 tonnes of processed steel. By 1942, Anshans Shwa Steel Works total production capacity reached 3,600,000 tonnes, making it one of the major iron and steel centers in the world.(In 1945 the steel plant was looted by soviet forces. The Republic of China government partially repaired the site but it was destroyed again during the Chinese civil war that saw the Communist forces victorious. The mills were once again repaired and Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang) was founded in 1948. Form then to 2001, the company produced 290 million tons of steel, 284 million tons of pig iron and 192 million tons of rolled steel. Until relatively recently, when a new steel plant opened in Shanghai, Angang was the largest steel producer in China. Today, Angang consists of three steelworks with 13 rolling mills plus supporting plants which produce coke, refractory materials and machinery for the steel plants. The company has an annual production capacity of 10 million tons of pig iron, 10 million tons of steel and 9.5 million tons of rolled steel. A quarter of Chinas total iron ore reserves, about 10 billion tons, are located in Anshan ensuring that the city will remain an important steel producer well into the future.()Anshan is rich in other mineral wealth too. The southern and south eastern areas of Anshan are rich in magnesite. Reserves of magnesite here are equivalent to a quarter of all world wide reserves. Anshan also has the worlds largest reserve of talcum accounting for fully one third of the entire world supply. The Xiuyan area of Anshan is known for the production of the precious stone, Jade. The largest single jade stone ever found came from Xiuyan, now carved into the form of a Buddha, it is a major tourist attraction in the area.Anshan is serviced by Shenyang airport, about 90 kilometers to the north, and by two major highways linking it with Shenyang and Dalian.(The government of Anshan established a five-year plan in 2000 with the aim of turning the city into a strong modern industrial city with plenty of tourism. It also aimed to make the city GDP reach 100 billion RMB by 2005 and to build a modern industrial city by using advances in technology to transform the traditional industries. Attracting foreign investment is also another main idea in the plan. The Anshan government anticipates the foreign investment assets would be around 80 billion RMB by 2005.Anshan has been identified by the Intelligence Unit in the November 2010 Access China White Paper as a member of the CHAMPS (Chongqing, Hefei, Anshan, Maanshan, Pingdingshan and Shenyang), an economic profile of the top 20 emerging cities in China.(THE RISE OF THE CHAMPS - NEW REPORT MAPS BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IN CHINAS FASTEST GROWING CITIES) The social and cultural dynamics underpinning the opportunities for consumer-led economic growth in the city have been documented by the sociologist and ethnographer Michael B. Griffiths.(Griffiths, Michael. B., Flemming Christiansen, and Malcolm Chapman. (2010) Chinese Consumers: The Romantic Reappraisal. Ethnography, Sept 2010, 11, 331-357.)(Griffiths, Michael. B. (2010) Lamb Buddhas Migrant Workers: Self-assertion on Chinas Urban Fringe. Journal of Current Chinese Affairs (China Aktuell), 39, 2, 3-37.)DemographicsSituated in the North East of China, what the Chinese now call Dongbei (East-north), and known to history as Manchuria, it is not surprising that Anshan prefecture is home to many people form the Manchu ethnic group. However this ethnic population is now relatively small. Of the 3,584,000 people living in Anshan prefecture, only 519,400 are Man nationals. They are mainly in or around the Xiuyan Man regional national autonomy area which is within Anshans borders. During the last years of the dynasty, large numbers of Han people migrated to the north east in search of work. This pattern continued into the 20th century. The development of Anshan as a large industrial center during and after world war II caused the citys population to increase rapidly. The new arrivals significantly out numbering the local Man people. As of the last census data, Anshan was home to 48 Chinese ethnic groups. The Han people make up the lions share at 3,020,500 people. Next, after the Han and Man people, come the Hui nationality and the Chaoxian with 23,400 and 10,000 people respectively. The Hui population is widely dispersed but the Chaoxian population is mostly concentrated in Teixi (West district) and Qianshan district.()Anshan has a population of 3.65 million at the 2010 census. As the city has expanded, the area between Anshan and the neighbouring city of Liaoyang has become urbanised, with little or no farmland visible on route between them. According the the 2010 census, the conurbation of urban Anshan and urban Liaoyang districts contains 2.17 million inhabitants.The city of Anshan can be divided into districts. The East district, Tiedong has a population of 452,900. The western district, Tiexi has 311,600 people. These two districts are demarcated by the railway lines that run north to south through the city. The north western portion of the city is dominated by the large steel works of Angang. The district of Lishan houses 425,600 people and the suburbs of Qianshan district have 366,200 soles. Within Anshan prefecture lies the subordinate city of Haicheng which accounts for 1,181,100 people. The neighbouring subordinate town of Taian has 354,700 people.Tourist attractionsIn recent years, Anshan has been trying to throw off its image as a heavy industrial town along with the dirt and pollution that goes with such industry. It has remodeled itself as a tourist destination.Foremost among the attractions in Anshan is National Park () which is about 18 km, by road, to the south east of the city. Qianshan literally means, Thousand Mountains. The name is actually and abbreviation of Thousand lotus flower mountains. The peaks were said to resemble the petals of the lotus flower which had been dropped to earth by a goddess. The park area of 44 square kilometers, is filled with both Buddhist and Taoist temples, monasteries and nunneries. It is one of few locations where both religions are found sharing the same site.Motor cars are not allowed within the park. Tourists must either walk or hire one of the electric taxis. Many foot paths climb steeply up the hillsides through thick forest. These foot paths lead past steles honoring the dead, small shrines, pagodas and temples. For those who are less fit, three cable car routes can convey you up the hill sides. However, none of the cable cars will take you the whole way, leaving you some climbing to do by yourself. One mountain in the park is shaped in such a way that it resembles a Buddha. It is claimed to be the largest naturally occurring image of Matria Buddha in the world. Several temples have been built on the peaks of the overlooking hills. Near the Matria Buddha is a large net enclosed area which contains a bird park.Another major tourist location is Anshans 219 park. The name of the park commemorates the liberation of Anshan by the Peoples Liberation Army on the 19th of February 1948. The park contains the Dongshan (East Mountain) scenic area as well as numerous lakes. Of particular note is the Jade Buddha temple (Yufo yuan). This large Buddhist temple complex of 22,104 square metres, houses the worlds large statue of Buddha made of Jade (It is called jade in Chinese, but in English it is Serpentine). It is a single piece of jade stone measuring 6.88 metres in width, 4.10 metres front to back and 7.95 metres high. The jade stone weighs 260.76 tons.( ) The front of the stone has been carved with an image of Sakyamuni (aka. Gautama) Buddha. On the back of the stone Guanyin (aka. Avalokitesvara) Buddha has been carved. The jade stone was found in 1960 in Xiuyan County. It was declared a treasure of the State and listed as a protected property by Chinese Premier Enlai. Anshan city government commissioned the carving which took a team of 120 sculptures 18 months to complete. The temple complex was opened on the 3rd of September 1996. The building that houses the Jade Buddha statue is 33 metres tall, representing the 33 layers of heaven in Buddhism. It claims to be one of the tallest buildings of ancient Chinese architectural style in China.Anshan contains naturally hot spring water spas. There are four spas/hotels in Anshan. Visitors may shower and bathe in the spring water. At Tanggangzi Spa, once frequented by the Qing Emperors of China, visitors may have mud treatment where they are buried in hot volcanic sand, which has been infused with the spring water. The energy is also used to provide hot steam and water for winter heating throughout the area.Education systemThe city contains two large Universities.*of Science and Technology Liaoning*Normal UniversityFamous residentsAnshan was the birthplace of Hui (born 1947), a Kong-based director, one of the most critically acclaimed amongst the Kong New Wave.

Hol is a municipality in Buskerud county, Norway.  Administrative historyThe area of Hol was separated from the municipality of l in 1877 to become a separate municipality.  In 1937 a part of Uvdal with 220 inhabitants was moved to Hol municipality. The area of Dagali was transferred from the neighboring municipality of Uvdal to Hol in 1944.In 1962 Uvdal was reunited with Nore to form the new municipality og Uvdal.

Whistler_Blackcomb
Whistler Blackcomb () is a major resort located 125 km north of Vancouver, in Columbia, Canada. By many measures it is the largest ski resort in America; it is 50% larger than its nearest competitor in terms of size, has the greatest uphill lift capacity, and until 2009, had the highest vertical skiable distance by a wide margin. Whistler Blackcomb also features the 2 Peak Gondola for moving between Whistler and Blackcomb mountains at the top; Peak 2 Peak holds records for the highest and longest unsupported cable car span in the world. With all of this capacity, Whistler Blackcomb is also often the most-visited ski resort, often besting 2 million visitors a year.Whistler was originally conceived as part of a bid to win the Winter Olympics, but a series of events led to the bids being withdrawn or losing to other cities. Construction of the resort started in spite of this, and the resort first opened for business in February 1966. The resort expanded extensively in the 1980s and 90s, becoming the centrepiece of a renewed bid on the part of nearby Vancouver. Vancouver/Whistler was selected as the winning bid for the Winter Olympics in July 2003. Whistler Blackcomb hosted the alpine skiing events, including the mens and womens Olympic and Paralympic alpine skiing disciplines of downhill, Super-G, slalom, combined and slalom. The Dave Murray downhill course towards Whistler Creekside finally hosted an Olympic downhill event, 50 years after it was originally surveyed for this purpose.  Whistler and Blackcomb were originally separate resorts, until they merged in 1997. Intrawest, the BC real estate firm that developed Blackcomb, purchased Whistler and merged the two operations. Over the next decade, the company expanded by purchasing additional ski resorts across North America, before expanding into golf and other resorts as well. Today, Intrawest owns ten ski resorts, another ten getaway resorts (mostly beachside) and two heliskiing companies. Whistler Village, widely recognized for its livable design, formed the basis of similar Tyrolian-inspired developments at their expanding series of resorts, as well as other resorts that hired Intrawest to build similar developments on their behalf. Intrawest resorts share a common recognizable style.In 2006 Intrawest was purchased by the alternative asset management firm, Investment Group. Three weeks before the opening of the Olympics, Fortress failed to make payment on its loan used to buy out Intrawest.  This caused its creditors to force Intrawest to divest itself of several of its resort holdings in 2009 and 2010 which includes Whistler Blackcomb, in order to reduce its debt load.( )DescriptionWhistler Mountain is the right-most (southern) mountain when looking at the Whistler-Blackcomb ski area from Whistler Village. It has a summit elevation of 2284 meters (7,160 ft). The total vertical drop is 1530 meters (5,020 ft) and  skiable inbound terrain.  Whistler is served by a total of 20 lifts; 2 gondolas, 7 high-speed detachable quad chair lifts, 2 fixed grip chair lifts, 2 T-bars. and the drive station for the 2 Peak Gondola connecting it with Blackcomb mountain to the north. There are 4 on-hill restaurants, as well as a childrens ski school facility and children can sign up for a five day lesson called Adventure Camp.  It is served by two base areas:  Whistler Creek, the original base on its southwest flank, and Whistler Village on its northwest flank.Blackcomb Mountain is the left-most (northern) mountain when looking at the Whistler-Blackcomb ski area from Whistler Village. It has a summit elevation of 2182 metres (7,494 ft) at the top of the 7th Heaven chair - Blackcomb Mountain itself is higher at 2440 meters (8000 ft), but unlike Whistler the peak is not lift-served. Blackcomb has a higher skiable vertical, at 1609 meters (5,280 ft),( {{cite web|urlhttp://www.travelchannel.com/Places_Trips/Travel_Ideas/Skiing/Whistler_Blackcomb_Ski_Guide|titleWhistler Blackcomb Ski Guide|accessdate09-21-2011 ) and less in-bound skiing area at . It is served by 17 lifts; 1 gondola, 6 high-speed quads, 3 fixed-grip triples and 7 surface lifts, as well as the end-station for the Peak 2 Peak. Blackcomb is the location of the world famous Couloir Extreme run, which is one of the top ten steep in-bounds runs in the world according to Skiing Magazine.  Originally called the Saudan Couloir by local skiers even before it was part of the ski area, the company eventually had to drop the name when extreme skier Saudan complained about the unauthorised use of his name.The two previously separate ski areas of Whistler and Blackcomb were integrated into one operation in 1997(Intrawest: History) after Intrawest merged with Whistler Mountain Ski Corporation. Ticketing, pass, and access control systems for the two ski areas were fully integrated in 2003. Together, Whistler and Blackcomb form the largest ski area in North America at , 54% larger than that of Vail, the next largest, which has . Either mountain alone would be in the top-five in terms of size. The mountains are accessed primarily via three gondolas, Blackcomb Excalibur Gondola and Whistler Mountain Village Gondola in the Village, and the Whistler Creekside Gondola to the south in the Creekside area. Alternates include several high-speed quads. The primary skiing terrain starts about one-third up the mountains. Ski-outs to the valley are usually possible during the months of December through April. The mid- and upper- areas are serviced by 10 high-speed detachable chairs and 5 fixed-grip lifts made by Engineering, Doppelmayr and Poma. Four T-bars service the Glacier and the Whistler alpine regions and take skiers to the entrance to Blackcomb Glacier. The overall lift capacity, 65,507 skiers per hour, is the greatest in North America.Travelling from one mountain to the other, while staying in the ski area, was only possible at the valley elevation before 2008. It was only when Whistler Blackcomb connected the two mountains at approximately 1,800 m (6,000 ft) with the 2 Peak Gondola that visitors could then travel between mountains without skiing down and taking the regular lifts up. This lift opened on December 12, 2008.() The lift has a total length of  and the longest unsupported span for a lift of its kind in the world at  while also having the highest ground clearance for a lift of its kind, 436 m (1,427 ft) above the valley floor.()Whistler Village, which is part of the Resort Municipality of Whistler, a geo-political entity not directly associated with Intrawests operation, is situated at the base of the Whistler Mountain Village Gondola and Blackcomb Excalibur Gondola. The Village incorporates community services, shops, entertainment venues, restaurants, bars, hotels, condominiums and vacation properties. The Village is 675 m (2,214 ft) above sea level, and is located  from International Airport.HistoryEarly visitorsThe valley area between Whistler and Blackcomb was first surveyed and documented in 1858 by Hudsons Bay men looking for an alternate route into the Cariboo area further north. Although little-used at the time, the route would later become one of the many paths used during the Gold Rush at the turn of the century. Known as the Pemberton Trail, the route followed a path similar to the Sea-to-Sky Highway, leading past the Whistler area to the present day town of Pemberton. In the 1860s British Naval surveyors named the mountain London Mountain, but it soon garnered the nickname Whistler because of the shrill whistle made by the Hoary Marmots who lived among the rocks. Four lakes paralleled the route of Trail, the highest then being known as Summit Lake. However, there was another Summit Lake in BC, and in 1910 the name was changed to its current form, Alta Lake.(Walking) One of the first permanent residents in the Alta Lake area was trapper John Millar, who set up a cabin next to the trail just south of the base of the mountain. During a trip to sell furs in Vancouver in 1911, Millar stopped at the Horseshoe Bar & Grill for dinner. The cook was Alex Philip from Maine, and Millar invited Philip to join him for dinner. Millar was a storyteller, and during the conversations that followed, he invited Philip to visit the Alta area. Alex and his wife Myrtle visited what was then known as Summit Lake several times over the next few years, and in 1913 they purchased  of land on the northwest corner of Alta Lake for $700.(Rainbow LodgeBy 1914, their Rainbow Lodge fishing resort was completed with four bedrooms, a large living/dining area and a kitchen. The resort was named for the trout that were the main attraction of the resort.( That same year, the Great Eastern Railway (PGE) reached the lake, from Squamish. Executives of the PGE suggested the Lodge host fishermen from Vancouver, which was now less than two days away (from three or more) via steamship to Squamish and then the PGE to Alta Lake. A standard rate of $2 for a week was applied, and the very first group arrived with 25 people. The resort was a hit.( Millar left when the railway arrived, looking to get further away from civilization.Building followed demand, and over time the lodge grew to include an additional 45 buildings (cabins, tennis courts, general store, post office) and could accommodate 100 people. It became the most popular west coast resort for 30 years.((History) The Philips operated the Lodge until 1948 when they sold it to Alec and Audrey Greenwood. The main Lodge burnt down in 1977, but today the area has been preserved as Rainbow Park. The Philips both remained in the valley until their deaths. Alex died in 1968 at the age of 86, and Myrtle died in 1986 at the age of 95.(Following the successful launch of the Rainbow Lodge, several other camps set up on the lake. Russ Jordan opened the Alta Lake Hotel which burned down in 1930, and replaced it with Jordans Lodge on nearby Nita Lake. Bert and Agnes Harrop built Harrops Point in the 1920s. This became the Cypress Lodge in 1945 under its then-owner Dick Fairhurst, who built new cabins and a main lodge in the early 1960s. In 1972 the property was purchased by the Canadian Youth Hostel Association and it remained the Whistler Hostel until it was closed in 2010 when the association (now Hostelling International) opened a new, larger hostel. Cecilia and John Mansell moved to Alta Lake in 1945 and built the Hillcrest Lodge near todays Lakeside Park on Alta Lake. They sold it in 1965 to the Mason Family and others who operated it as Mount Whistler Lodge for skiers. The main lodge was burnt in a fire practice by the fire department in 1986.(There was some commercial use of the London Mountain area as well. Logging had been carried out for some time, but the arrival of the railway in 1914 made this much more profitable and for several years there were a few sizable mills and lumber operations: The Barrs at Parkhurst Mill on Green Lake (to the north), and the Gebharts with the Rainbow Lumber Company on Alta Lake. The fur trade remained for some time, later supplanted by a mink and marten farm. Jimmy Fitzsimmons ran a prospecting support company, which led to mining surveys up Fitzsimmons Valley. The shafts can still be found on the Singing Pass trail.(Olympic dreamsIn 1960 the Canadian Olympic Association visited the west coast looking for potential sites for a future Winter Olympics. They initially looked at a site on Diamond Head() just north of Squamish, which was already developed to the extent of a single chairlift. However, they concluded that the area simply couldnt be developed properly, it just wasnt the right terrain for a world-class resort.( Franz Wilhelmsen, a local businessman who had married into the Seagram family, had already come to the same conclusions when he had been scouting areas for a new ski resort. He met with the COA and convinced them to look further north in the London Mountain area, And they were impressed.(Encouraged by their positive reviews, Wilhelmsen organized the Garibaldi Olympic Development Association (GODA) to make a formal bid. At this time there was no road, no electricity, and no piped water or sewer in Alta Lake. Their bid for the Olympics was unsurprisingly rejected, and the Canadian bid was given to Calgary, who came in a close second place to Grenoble. Undaunted, Wilhelmsen decided to press ahead with development of a resort.(In 1962 the Garibaldi Lifts Limited was formed with Franz Wilhelmsen as President. It had two main objectives, to finance and supervise required land/business studies, and to erect and operate ski lifts on London Mountain. The company had little experience in ski operations, so they hired Schaeffler, a well known developer, to help them.  Schaeffler proved as enthusiastic about London Mountain as COA and GODA had been. Schaeffler returned and wrote a good feasibility study about the Alta area, which had no mining claims.(From 1962 to 1965 Garibaldi Lifts raised funds and began development of the ski area on the south side of the mountain. The government agreed that they would set aside a  plot at the base of the mountain for Garibaldi Lifts Limited to buy, and agreed to bring the highway to the base of the mountain if they could raise enough money. By 1965 they had reached their goal of raising $800,000 and started planning for development. However, they were not happy with the name, and on 27 August 1965 London Mountain officially became Whistler Mountain.(By 1965 the Provincial Government had completed a narrow gravel road from Vancouver. Electricity arrived the same year with the installation of a substation along the lines from Bridge River. Everything was in place, and the Alta area became a hive of development.( GODA made a bid for the Winter Olympics, but Banff won again and eventually lost to Japan.(Whistler opensBy the fall of 1965 the ski area featured a four person gondola to the mountains mid-station, a double chairlift to the alpine tree line (the Red Chair), and two T-bars, all provided by Mueller. In addition a day lodge was constructed and six ski runs cut into the hill. Whistler officially opened for skiing for the first time on 15 February 1966. The new mountain won instant acclaim for its vertical drop, good snow conditions, and huge alpine area. The only problem at the time was the roadit was a dirt logging track, which was only plowed on Saturday, to the detriment of Friday travellers.(With real infrastructure in place, in 1968 GODA made another bid for the Winter Olympics, and this time the joint Vancouver/Garibaldi won the Canadian nomination. However, in 1970 when Montreal won the voting for the Summer Olympics, Vancouver/Garibaldi was removed from further consideration and the games eventually went to Colorado. In a stunning turn of events, Denver turned down the games after winning the bidding. The games were then offered to the other North American entry, Vancouver/Garibaldi, but political turmoil due to the recent change in government led to the bid being withdrawn, and in desperation the IOC returned the games to Innsbruck for a second time in a row.The gravel road was paved to Whistler in 1966, and to Pemberton in 1969. The Blue and Green chairlifts were added in 1970, providing access to additional terrain. In 1972 these were joined by the Olive and Orange chairlifts. A parallel lift to the Green Chair to alleviate crowds came in 1974, and the Little Red Chair came in 1978. The Roundhouse, an on-mountain lodge and restaurant, was completed in 1980.  This new lodge provided respite for cold skiers who had survived the long ride up on the Red Chair.Whistler VillageIn 1974 the provincial Democratic Party of British Columbia was interested in developing tourism and took a number of steps affecting Whistler. At the time, the Alta Lake area was overdeveloped, so the government instituted a development freeze while they studied the problem. The only solution was to continue development in another location. They quickly decided to focus on the table between Whistler and Blackcomb, about 4 km to the north of the existing facilities on Alta Lake. At that time this was the site of the Alta Lake dump, and the remains of a Volkswagen Van are still buried under the modern village.(In 1975 the Municipality of Whistler (RMOW) was formed, the first Resort Municipality in Canada and also the first place in British Columbia since Canadian prohibition where bars were allowed to be open on Sunday. The act also created the Whistler Village Land Company who would oversee all development of the new Whistler Village. In 1977 the provincial government named Raine the Provincial Ski Area Co-ordinator, in charge of expanding BCs skiing capabilities. Raine was previously National Coach for the Canadian Womens Ski Team, and was married to famous Canadian skier Greene. Raine saw the potential in developing Mountain, then part of the Provincial Park, and joined the Whistler city council. The Blackcomb area was currently zoned for logging, but Raine and Greene successfully lobbied the government to remove the zoning and allow development as a ski area.(In 1977 the Municipality hired Sutcliffe Griggs Moodie Development Consultants to design a layout for Whistler Villages development. However, their design was considered too conventional and allowed too much car traffic. Raine recommended Eldon Beck, who had been the primary designer at Vail, celebrated for its layout. Becks designs included a pedestrian Main Street Village Stroll and an elevated covered walkway system, limiting all vehicles to the outside of the developed area. To this day the Village retains this basic design in spite of dramatic expansions, and has won worldwide acclaim in architecture circles.(In January 1978,  of land were given to the Whistler municipality to develop the town centre. The first sod for the village was turned on 18 August 1978 by first Mayor Pat Carleton. By 1979 lots of amenities were in place, including Municipal Hall, Fire Hall, Health Care Centre, and Elementary School. Phase 1 expansion included 11 parcels in the modern Village Square area, including the Whistler Conference Centre, a variety of hotels, restaurants, grocery store, hardware store, etc. An enormous underground garage was built to support all of the buildings in the area, completed before any construction could start above it.( The first hotel, the Blackcomb Lodge, anchors the Village Square area to this day.Blackcomb opensIn 1978 a call for bids was issued to develop Blackcomb for skiing. The bidding to develop Blackcomb was contested by two companies, the Aspen Ski Company, and the newly-formed Blackcomb Ski Company.( Aspen, having recently developed the Mountain Resort in Alberta, won the contest. A new company, Fortress Mountain Resorts, was formed with a 50-50 partnership between Aspen and the Business Development Bank of Canada. The new competition, paid for partially by tax dollars, was not initially appreciated by Whistler. Initial development of the mountain included four triple chairlifts (later named Cruiser, Stoker, Catskinner and Fitzsimmons) and one double chairlift supplied by Engineering. At the time the lifts were referred to only by number.Blackcomb opened for skiing on 6 December 1980,( along with the newly constructed Village. To ensure guests could continue to easily access Whistler from the new Village, three triple chairlifts were added to Whistler for the same season; the Village, Olympic, and Black Chairs, used in succession, took skiers to the Roundhouse Lodge.  Whistlers original base began to be referred to as Whistler Creek, or Creekside, after the creek that runs through the area.Competition and buildoutThroughout the 1980s the two ski areas competed strongly for ticket sales among the Village visitors, which led to a rapid buildout of new lifts that opened new areas and improved ride times.In 1982, Chair 6 (later rebranded Jersey Cream) opened in the Horstman Creek drainage on Blackcomb. Whistler cut new trails along the norther flank of the mountain. In 1983 Blackcomb acquired a used T-Bar from Fortress Mountain and installed it on a south-facing slope, in full view of Whistler Mountain. This 7th lift was coined 7th Heaven T-Bar and gave access to high alpine and glaciated terrain. It also gave Blackcomb the highest lift-serviced vertical drop of any ski area in North America, with the top of the lift at . Blackcomb promoted themselves as the Mile High Mountain.Whistler responded in 1986 with the Peak Chair to the summit of Whistler Mountain at . Although not as high as 7th Heaven, this lift opened up Whistler Mountains alpine terrain, and allowed access to the Harmony Bowl area. The new terrain made Whistler the largest alpine ski area in America.(Skiers could buy a Blackcomb pass, a Whistler pass, or a Dual Mountain pass.  Locals loved when tourists would ask Where is Dual Mountain?(Intrawest buys BlackcombIn 1986, Blackcombs assets and real estate rights were bought by fledgling real estate developer Intrawest. Intrawest was an early developer of timeshare listings, and saw the potential in developing the ski resort with condominium assets as a timeshare destination.(Intrawest)Intrawest immediately carried out massive upgrades on Blackcomb. They started by moving the 7th Heaven T-Bar to Horstman Glacier, and adding the Showcase T-Bar running up the back of the Glacier to the 7th Heaven peak. The original 7th Heaven T-Bar was replaced by a new Doppelmayr quad chairlift. Two additional Doppelmayr detachable quads were added as the Wizard and Solar Coaster lifts, cutting the ride time from base to the alpine area from 45 minutes to 15. The Rendezvous Restaurant was re-dubbed Base 2 and the moniker moved to the restaurant at the top of the Solar Coaster lift.Renewed competitionIn response to Blackcomb Mountains construction of three high-speed quads, Whistler Mountain undertook one of the biggest ski-lift construction projects ever realized in Canada at the time, the construction of the Whistler Express Gondola. Carrying passengers 1,157 m (3,795 ft) vertically and  horizontally over 63 support towers, the lift opened on 24 November 1988. In 1990 Whistler began upgrading its aging fleet of fixed grip chairlifts with the addition of its first quad chairlift. The Green Chair Express, which replaced the two Green Chairs, was built by Engineering (Yan), and substantially cut long lift queues in the Green area of the mountain. A year later, Whistler Mountain replaced three double chairlifts and the original Creekside gondola with two quad chairlifts, the Quicksilver Express and Redline Express lifts, also built by Engineering. 1994 saw the removal of the Blue Chair, and the construction of the Harmony Express to Little Whistler Peak, built by Poma.In 1994, Blackcomb made its last major lift expansion with the replacement of the Stoker, Cruiser, and Fitzsimmons lifts with the high-speed Excelerator quad chair and Excalibur Gondola. The second is dubbed by some as the gondola to nowhere since it doesnt connect with any restaurant or access additional terrain. However, it allowed rapid alpine access for skiers in Whistler Village, who previously had to take 4 chairlifts to Rendezvous (Fitzsimmons, Stoker, Cruiser, and Jersey Cream, with 3 of those being slower chairs). The Excelerator also opened up a vast area of intermediate-difficulty terrain to the left of Solar Coaster and below Jersey Cream that was previously neglected and under-utilized, because skiers who travel those slopes frequently had to go all the way to the bottom of the mountain, which is over-skied and icy.This competition had driven development of the two mountains at a rate no other resorts could come close to matching. In 1992, Country Magazine voted Whistler the Number One Ski Resort in North America. Similar #1 rankings quickly followed from other major magazines, and between 1992 and 2000 it won #1 ranking from one of the major magazines every year.  In 1996, it became the only resort in history to be simultaneously named #1 by Snow Country, SKI and Skiing Magazines.(Intrawest buys WhistlerFile:Whistler Mountain 3.jpg|right|thumb|600 px|Whistler Mountain, as seen looking south from Blackcomb Mountain. The original Whistler area starts mid-frame and extends down and to the right. Whistler Peak is just to the right of the fold. To the left of the peak is the Harmony Bowl area, Little Whistler Peak, and then the recently opened Symphony Bowl. Tusk Peak can be seen in the distance between Whistler Peak and Little Whistler.In 1997, the Whistler Mountain Ski Corporation was also bought out by Intrawest.(Like their expansion on Blackcomb, Intrawest immediately started a major build-out on Whistler. The Quicksilver lift was replaced with a Poma gondola, the Creekside Gondola, while the Green Chair Express and Redline lifts were removed and replaced with Doppelmayr high speed quad chair lifts, aptly named the Emerald Express and Big Red Express lifts. The original Roundhouse was demolished and a new lodge built in its place. Around this time Intrawest began marketing the two mountains as one large ski area under the name Whistler-Blackcomb.  On 20 April 1999, Whistler Blackcomb became the first North American ski resort to top 2 million skier visits in one season.1998 saw the replacement of the Peak Chair with a high-speed quad. The original Peak Chair was renamed to Franzs Chair and moved parallel to the Big Red Express chair with a return station approximately half way up the Big Red Express lift line. Franzs Chair runs primarily in early and late season, when lower altitudes are not well covered. The Black Chair was replaced with a high-speed quad (Garbanzo Express Chair), and another was added (the Fitzsimmons Express Chair) in 2000, following the line of the long-gone Village Chair. The top of the Fitzsimmons and the bottom of the Garbanzo are co-located in the Village Gondola Olympic station area, providing extra lift capacity from the Whistler Village to the top of the mid-mountain zone in addition to the gondola itself.Starting in 2000, Intrawest started re-developing the Creekside area with new village layout. Throughout, Intrawest also extensively developed the summertime attractions, notably golf and biking. Today, Whistler Blackcomb averages 2 million visitors during the ski season, but another 2.5 during the summer.(Whistler Blackcombs 2006/2007 season saw the construction and opening of the Symphony Express, a high speed quad that begins towards the bottom of the Symphony Amphitheater and carries riders to the top of Piccolo.() One of the original names suggested for this lift was Piccolo Express.()A more ambitious upgrade is the 2 Peak Gondola, which connects Whistler and Blackcombs mid-station restaurants, about 2/3 of the way up the mountain. Peak-to-Peak opened for the first time on 12 December 2008, but low snowfall meant it was rockbound at the time. The first summer operation day was June 6, 2009.Renewed Olympic bidAs Whistler Blackcomb continued to win awards - eight consecutive by 2000 - the resort formed the basis of a renewed Olympics bid, this time for the Winter Olympics. Calgary also bid for the Canadian entry, as their equipment from the Winter Olympics was already in place and allowed them to offer a low-cost bid, as did City, which lost the 2002 bid. Calgary was eliminated in close voting on 21 November 1998, and Vancouver-Whistler won the second round of voting on 3 December. In IOC voting Pyeongchang, South Korea won the initial round, which eliminated Salzburg, but in the second round on 2 July 2003, they won every one of Salzburgs supporters and bested Pyeongchang 56-53.Whistler Mountain hosted the alpine skiing events. The mens skiing took place on the Dave Murray Downhill course, while womens skiing took place on a new course, which starts on Wild Card, cuts across Jimmys Joker to Franzs Run and connects at the bottom of the Dave Murray Downhill. In order to serve the spectators and judges who need to travel only to the timing area a short distance above the Creekside area, the Timing Flats Express, a Doppelmayr high-speed quad, was added to the Creekside base. This alleviates demand on the main Gondola and other lifts that serve the starting areas, much higher up the mountain. The lift is only temporary and in the summer of 2010, it was dismantled and trucked to Village, Alberta and replaced the Strawberry chair.Blackcomb Mountain hosted the bobsleigh, luge and skeleton events at Whistler Sliding Centre. Olympic Park hosted Olympic and Paralympic biathlon, cross-country skiing, Nordic combined and ski jumping, some distance to the south of the Creekside area in the Valley. Whistler Blackcomb says the mountains will remain 90% open to the public during the 2010 Winter Games.The British Columbia government paid $600 million for major upgrades to the Sea-to-Sky Highway,() which would carry the majority of visitors to the alpine sites.Summer 2010 had two lift construction projects at Creekside Base, site of skiing at Vancouver 2010. The Timing Flats Express, used for passenger transport for the games, was removed and re-built as the Strawberry Express at Sunshine Village, Alberta, Canada. The second project is the construction of the long-awaited Kadenwood Gondola, providing access to the Kadenwood Estate Homes. Built by Doppelmayr-CTEC, the pulse gondola with 8 passenger cabins in two groups of 2 will be technologically advanced, with no staff needed to operate. Homeowners will simply walk up to the lift, swipe a card (similar to one used to access a hotel room), and the lift will begin operation, completing a half-rotation (bottom > top or top > bottom). This will mean the lift can run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for most of the year, but will only operate when needed, including the summer, with only a maintenance shutdown, most likely in the fall. Lifts thumb|200px|right|Catskinner ChairOther facilitiesWhistler Mountain Bike ParkThe Whistler Mountain Bike Park celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2008. Having consistently grown since its inception, it sees an average of 100,000 bikers each summer.The Whistler Mountain Bike Park uses the Fitzsimmons and Garbanzo quad chairlifts, as well as the Whistler Village Gondola to shuttle bikers to around midstation, at 1,200 m (4,000 ft). The park has 47+ trails for all skill levels totaling 250 km + of trails. There are smooth trails with gentle banked corners for beginners, steep twisty trails for intermediates, tight trails with jumps and stunts for advanced riders, and challenging trails with giant jumps, drops, and root-strewn terrain for the experts.During the summer, high speed quad chairlifts (Fitzimmons and Garbanzo) used by the bike park have every second chair replaced with a bike rack. These racks fit four bikes, three in grooves and one on a hook on the side of the chair. The bikers then get on the next chair which is a normal passenger carrier.The bike park has two zones: the Fitzsimmons Zone (the lower zone) and the Garbanzo Zone (the upper zone). All riders take either the Village Gondola or the Fitzsimmions quad to the Olympic Station area. Then intermediate and advanced riders can take the Garbanzo quad up further to the Garbanzo zone. Garbanzo riders can then return to midstation or Whistler Village, the base of the bike park. From the top of Garbanzo to the village is an impressive 1100 m (3,600 ft) vertical descent; eclipsed only by the more expensive guided descents from the top gondola station or the top of the Peak Chair, the highest accessible point on the mountain.  A-Line is the most well-known track.  The Boneyard Slopestyle Course is part of the Fitzsimmons Zone and is located at the very bottom of the bike park, visible from the base of Whistler Mountain. The Boneyard features a collection of high-intermediate and advanced slopestyle features, including drops, dirt jumps, and more.The park hosts two large, annual mountain biking competitions/festivals:  Crankworx is held in the summer; Harvest Huckfest is held in the fall. The mountain is frequented by professional mountain bikers such as Simmons, Shandro, Schley, Hopcraft, and Chausson.Whistler Blackcombs Tube ParkFor the 2005-06 ski season, Blackcomb Mountain opened the Tube Park to allow for recreational tubing at the resort. The tube park is located at Base II alongside the Village Run. Incidents Quicksilver Express grip failure, December 23, 1995The lift operator on the Quicksilver lift pressed the button to make a routine stop, to allow a fallen skier to get out of the way of the unloading ramp. Instead, the emergency brake activated, sending shockwaves down the cable. Grips on at least two of the chairs slipped, and caused chairs to slide down the cable and slam into each other. In all, eight were injured, and two were killed in one of the worst ski lift accidents in America.(Nixon, Emily Disaster and Emergency Management: The Quicksilver Chairlift Incident, Graduating Essay, University of Victoria, Geography Dept., April 2004)() The lifts manufacturer, Lift Engineering/Yan, entered bankruptcy after the incident in July 1996.() The cause was found to be a design fault in the Yan detachable grip. The Quicksilver lift was removed and replaced by the Creekside Gondola.Excalibur Gondola Collapse, December 16, 2008The Excalibur gondola had a major malfunction on December 16, 2008, when the upper portion of one of the lift towers detached and collapsed, causing several of the gondola cabins to drop near to the ground,() leaving 53() people trapped on the lower section of the lift line.  Firefighters rescued passengers from a cabin dangling over Fitzsimmons Creek, and from another gondola that landed on a bus shelter. The third cabin had crashed into the trees, narrowly missing a condominium.  Twelve people suffered minor injuries.() According to Whistler-Blackcomb, a joint in the tower separated due to the buildup of ice from water that had seeped into the tower.() The undamaged upper half of the lift running from Blackcombs Base 2 was reopened on Saturday 20 December.() After repairs were made to the collapsed tower, the whole lift was back in service on Wednesday 24 December.()Harmony Express grip failure, February 18, 2009A single grip on Whistlers Harmony Express failed and fell off the haul rope overnight on Wednesday, Feb. 18/Thursday, Feb. 19. The lift operations team was experiencing some problems with the lift during the day on Wednesday. The fallen chair was found overnight by a grooming machine operator at Tower 11. Upon inspection the next morning, maintenance crews discovered that a sheave train component on the downhill side had failed. This caused a compression sheave train arm to deflect into the path of a carrier, ultimately resulting in the release of the carrier from the cable. Further investigation revealed that the failed component was the articulation arm mounting bolt.The lift has been inspected since the accident. All similar bolts on the Harmony chair have since been replaced. All terrain in the Harmony Zone was still accessible while the lift was closed, via the Peak chair with a small hike from the top of the Saddle Run. Symphony Bowl was open with a ski out all the way to either the Emerald or Garbanzo Express Chairlifts, past the base of the closed Harmony Lift.()The lift re-opened on Sunday, February 22, 2009. The affected chair #37 has been permanently removed from operation.Whistler T-Bars summer maintenance incident, August 31, 2009On Monday, August 31, 2009, two Lift Maintenance employees were injured when the lift began to move, after being given the go-ahead while a maintenance person was safety-harnessed to the tower. The person remained attached to both the tower and the maintenance carrier while the second employee was secured to the carrier. The safety harness ended up pulling so hard on the maintenance carrier, the carrier became detached from the cable and dropped to the rocky ground below, severely injuring the worker in it. The employee hanging from the tower only received bruises.()Big Red Express Bolt Failure, December 6, 2009On Sunday, December 6, 2009, at 8:55am, a passenger aboard the Big Red Express on Whistler Mountain noticed that a sheave train had broken off Tower 31 and had fallen to the ground. They immediately notified the lift operator at the top terminal (2 towers away) and Whistler Blackcomb Lift Maintenance department. After almost a 30 minute inspection, they determined the issue was not severe enough to evacuate the lift. The lift was run at low speed to evacuate all passengers. All passengers were finally off the lift just before 10 am. The lift was closed down for the day, repaired, and back in operation Monday, Dec. 7. This issue arose almost a year after the Excalibur Gondola tower collapse, and 9 months after the Harmony Express incident (which is very similar to this incident, excluding the fact the chair fell off on Harmony) () Photographs File:Blackcomb Mountain-2007.jpg|A view of 7th Heaven on Blackcomb Mountain from Whistler Mountain.File:Blackcomb 1.jpgFile:Whistler Mountain 1.jpgFile:Whistler Mountain 3.jpgFile:Whistler Panorama -2007.jpg|Panorama of the two mountainsFile:BlackcombWizardExpressLift.jpg|The Wizard Express quad lift at the base of Blackcomb mountainFile:Jersey Cream Whistler BC Canada.JPG|View from top of Jersey Cream run with Jersey Cream Bowl in the backgroundFile:Whistler_Peak_Panorama.jpg|360 degree panorama from the top of Whistler PeakSee also* British Columbia (the Resort Municipality of Whistler)* Mountain (the geographical feature)* Peak (the geographical feature)* Provincial Park* 2 Peak Gondola* IntrawestReferencesNotesBibliography* (Stats), Mountain Stats, Whistler Blackcomb home page* (History), History, Whistler Blackcomb home page* (Look), A Look at Whistler History, Whistler Museum & Archives Society* (Walking), 2010 Village Olympic Walking Tour, Whistler Museum & Archives Society* (Intrawest), Intrawest Corporation Quick Facts, Intrawest Corp.External links*Vancouver2010.com profile*Whistler Blackcomb official site*Whistler Blackcomb - 2010 Winter Gamesde:Whistler-BlackcombBlackcombko:-BlackcombBlackcombja:BlackcombCreeksideBlackcombru:-Blackcomb

Elliot_Lake
footnotes               Municipal rank: 325th in CanadaElliot Lake (2006 population 11,549) is a city in Algoma District, Ontario, Canada. It is north of Huron, midway between the cities of Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie in the Ontario region.HistoryUntil the 1870s an Ojibwa village existed near the present hospital site on the lakes shoreline.The city was established as a community for the mining industry in 1955 after the discovery of uranium in the area, and named after the small lake on its northern edge. It was originally incorporated as an improvement district. Geologist Joubin and American financier Hirshhorn were instrumental in its founding. The principal mining companies were Mines and Algom. The population has varied with several boom-and-bust cycles from the 1950s to the 1990s, from a high of over 26,000 to a low of about 6,600.In 1959, the United States declared that it would buy no more uranium from Canada after 1962.  During the 1970s, federal plans for Reactors and Hydros interest in atomic energy led the town, anticipating a population of 30,000, to expand again. However, by the early 1990s depleted reserves and low prices caused the last mines in the area to close.Elliot Lake was incorporated as a city in 1990. In the years since, the city looked elsewhere for its survival, finding some success promoting itself as a retirement community and tourist destination. In the late 2000s, mineral exploration has begun taking place in the area, with at least one major new mining facility being developed by Mountain Resources.(Elliot Lake miner edges closer to uranium mine.. Ontario Business, July 1, 2008.)Uranium miningArea uranium mines* Mine (19561960 and 19821996), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 14 million tons of ore.* American Mine (19571959), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 79,000 tons of ore.()* Mine (19571960), operated by Denison Mines Ltd., produced 2.6 million tons of ore.* Mine (19571964), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 6.3 million tons of ore.* Mine (19571961 and 19781990), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 15 million tons of ore.* Mine (19571992), operated by Denison Mines Ltd., produced 69 million tons of ore.* Mine (19581960 and 19641985), operated by Denison Mines Ltd., produced 6.4 million tons of ore.* Mine(s) (19551961 and 19651990), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 44 million tons of ore.* Mine (19551970), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 2.3 million tons of ore.* Mine (19561960), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 276,000 tons of ore.* Mine Lake Nordic (19561960), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 3.4 million tons of ore.* Mine (19561970), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 13 million tons of ore.Health concernsUranium miners in Elliot Lake became alarmed about the high incidence of lung cancer and silicosis, and they went on strike over health and safety conditions. The government appointed a Royal Commission to investigate health and safety in mines. Chaired by Dr. James Ham, it became known as the Ham Commission.(http://www.worksmartontario.gov.on.ca/scripts/default.asp?contentID5-1-1-1#H2)Geography and environmentSituated on the Shield, the city is surrounded by dense forest, muskeg swamps, numerous lakes, winding rivers, and hills of Precambrian bedrock. The local forests are mixed deciduous and coniferous, with colourful displays in the autumn.Local wildlife include moose, Deer, Black Bear, beaver, loon, muskrat, otter, Goose, and lynx, to name but a few. Fish species include trout, speckled trout, trout, bass, pickerel (walleye), and sturgeon.Since December 1990 the town has been home to the Elliot Lake Research Field Station, established by University to investigate environmental radioactivity.Acclaimed Canadian photographer Burtynsky has taken landscape pictures of uranium and nickel tailings during the mid-1990s, providing evidence of the after-effects to the ecosystem.Climate* Average precipitation: 104.2 mmTransportationRelatively isolated, Elliot Lake is only connected to the south by Highway 108, a 30 km distance to Highway 17, also known as the Highway. Highway 639 extends for 24 kilometres north of the city to its terminus at Highway 546, although this is an almost entirely unpopulated route used primarily as an access road to Provincial Park and a few private wilderness recreation lodges. The Trail Route, a part of the Tourist Route network, follows a circle consisting of Highways 17, 108, 639 and 546.Lake Municipal Airport has no regularly scheduled flights.Lake Transit provides daily bus service on an hourly basis, with the exception of Sundays and statutory holidays.Arts and cultureLocal festivals include the Jewel in the Wilderness Festival, Heritage Weekend and the Elliot Lake Arts on the Trail festival.(http://www.artsonthetrail.com. Lake Standard, September 2008.)The city is home to Denison House, a hotel and convention facility located in the former corporate lodge of Denison Mines, and the Elliot Lake Mining and Nuclear Museum. Two community monuments, the Uranium Atom Monument downtown and the Miners Memorial Monument on Horne Lake, are also found in the city, as well as a scenic lookout at the former fire tower.In 1975, Canadian musician Tom Connors recorded Damn Good Song for a Miner, about the city of Elliot Lake and its mining culture in the 1960s.

Herne,_North_Rhine-Westphalia
Herne () is a city in Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is located in the area directly between the cities of Bochum and Gelsenkirchen. History Like most other cities in the region Herne was a tiny village until the 19th century. When the mining of coal and the production of steel began, the villages of the Ruhr area became cities.Present-day Herne includes the former settlements of Herne, Wanne and Eickel. Farms bearing these names were founded in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1860 the first coal mine started operation. In the following thirty years the population increased twentyfold. For the first time Herne was called a city. The same process took place in Wanne and Eickel, which merged in 1926 to form the new city of Wanne-Eickel. In 1975 Wanne-Eickel, by then a city with over 70,000 inhabitants, was incorporated into Herne.;World War IIHerne was targeted by the RAF on 4 June 1940, early in War II. Three high-explosive bombs were dropped and one house was damaged.()In Wanne-Eickel, the Krupp Treibstoffwerke oil refinery near the local Shamrock 3/4 coal mine was bombed during the Campaign of World War II. Notable places A fair called Kirmes is held in the citys Crange district every August. This is the second largest carnival in Germany with an average of around 4,500,000 visitors. Its origins can be traced back to the 15th century, when farmers started trading horses on Saint Lawrences Day. That is why the official opening always takes place on the first Friday in August. The horse market tradition is kept up, by arranging a horse show and horse equipment sales at the same place where horses were traded years ago. Today there are about 500 stalls every year covering 111,000 square metres, meaning that it takes a 5 kilometre walk to see the whole fairground. Among other things you can buy sugared almonds and all kinds of other food, visit beer gardens, win prizes in shooting galleries or tombolas, or enjoy traditional and new rides like roundabouts, ghost trains and all sorts of high-tech delights. One of the main attractions is the 60-metre high big wheel that is the largest movable one in the world. Notable persons Famous Hernians or Wanne-Eickelians include von Manger, Edelhagen, Marcus, Rhmann, Heinz Dieter Meyer, Schanzara, Dr. Claudia Dollins (Geier), Batrk, Zweyer, Wagner, Saint and Beuermann. The composer Linke lives in Herne.International relationsHerne, Germany is twinned with:*  Hnin-Beaumont, France, since 1954*  Wakefield, England,  Kingdom, since 1956*  Ometepe Island, Nicaragua, since 1988*  Belgorod, Russia, since 1990*  Eisleben, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, since 1990*  Konin, Poland, since 1991 References  External links ar:zh-min-nan:Hernebg:da:Hernede:Herneet:Hernees:Herne(Germanio)eu:Hernefa:(Rhnanie-du-Nord-Westphalie)ko:id:Herne(Germania)kk:sw:Herneku:Hernelt:Hern(Duitsland)ja:frr:Herneno:Hernenn:Hernepnb:nds:Hernepl:Herne(Alemanha)ro:Herneru:Germanysr:(kaupunki)Tysklandtr:Hernevi:Herne(Nordrhein-Westfalen)Alemanyazh:

Precious_metal
Image:GoldNuggetUSGOV.jpg|thumb|230px|A nuggetA precious metal is a rare, naturally occurring metallic element of high economic value.Chemically, the precious metals are less reactive than most elements, have high lustre, are softer or more ductile, and have higher points than other metals. Historically, precious metals were important as currency, but are now regarded mainly as investment and industrial commodities. Gold, silver, platinum, and palladium each have an 4217 currency code.The best-known precious metals are the metals gold and silver. While both have industrial uses, they are better known for their uses in art, jewellery and coinage. Other precious metals include the group metals: ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum, of which platinum is the most widely traded.(Platinum Guild: Applications Beyond Expectation)The demand for precious metals is driven not only by their practical use, but also by their role as investments and a of value. Historically, precious metals have commanded much higher prices than common industrial metals.Bullionthumb|right|Silver 1000oz barA metal is deemed to be precious if it is rare. The discovery of new sources of ore or improvements in mining or refining processes may cause the value of a precious metal to diminish. The status of a precious metal can also be determined by high demand or value. Precious metals in bulk form are known as bullion, and are traded on markets. Bullion metals may be cast into ingots, or minted into coins. The defining attribute of bullion is that it is valued by its mass and purity rather than by a value as money.(Gold bullion facts from freegoldtips.com)Purity and MassImage:Johnson Matthey 500 grammes silver bullion.jpg|thumb|left|A 500 gram silver bullion bar produced by MattheyThe level of purity varies from issue to issue.  99.9% purity is common.  The purest mass-produced bullion coins are in the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf series, which go up to 99.999% purity.  Note that a 100% pure bullion is impossible, as absolute purity in extracted and refined metals is asymptotically approached. Many bullion coins contain a stated quantity (such as one troy ounce) of the marginally-impure alloy. In contrast, the Krugerrand is one of many historic and modern bullion coins of 22 Kt gold, with a stated content (usually one troy ounce) of fine gold or 100% pure gold, with the other component(s) of the alloy making the coin heavier than one ounce in total. Still more bullion coins (for example: British Sovereign) state neither the purity nor the fine-gold weight on the coin, but are recognized and consistent in their composition, and many historically stated a denomination in currency (example: American Eagle).Coinagethumb|140px|right|Vienna Philharmonic 1oz coinMany nations mint coins.  Although nominally issued as tender, these coins face value as currency is far below that of their value as bullion. For instance, Canada mints a gold bullion coin (the Gold Maple Leaf) at a face value of $50 containing one troy ounce (31.1035 g) of goldas of May 2011, this coin is worth about $1,500 CAD as bullion.(Gold prices ran around $940 USD in July 2009 according to Kitco Historical Gold Charts and Data. The USD to CAD exchange rate averaged 1.129 in July 2009 according to OANDA Historical Exchange Rates. Although the exact moment that the $1075 figure was determined is unknown, it may be considered a reasonable value for the time.) Bullion coins minting by national governments gives them some numismatic value in addition to their bullion value, as well as certifying their purity.Image:Platinum eagle.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Platinum Eagle bullion coinOne of the largest bullion coins in the world is the 10,000 dollar Gold Nugget coin minted in Australia which consists of a full kilogram of 99.9% pure gold. There have been a small number of larger bullion coins, but they are impractical to handle and not produced in mass quantities. China has produced coins in very limited quantities (less than 20 pieces minted) that exceed 260 troy ounces (8 kg) of gold. Austria has minted a coin containing 31 kg of gold (the Vienna Philharmonic Coin minted in 2004 with a face value of 100,000 euro). As a stunt to publicise the 99.999% pure one-ounce Canadian Gold Maple Leaf series, in 2007 the Canadian Mint made a 100 kg 99.999% gold coin, with a face value of $1 million, and now manufactures them to order, but at a substantial premium over the market value of the gold.Economic Usethumb|110px|right|1kg gold bar (ingot)Gold and silver, and sometimes other precious metals, are often seen as hedges against both inflation and economic downturn. coins have become popular with collectors due to their relative affordability, and unlike most gold and platinum issues which are valued based upon the markets, silver issues are more often valued as collectables, far higher than their actual bullion value.AluminiumA precious metal that became common is aluminium. Although aluminium is one of the most commonly occurring elements in the Earths crust, it was at one time found to be exceedingly difficult to extract from its various ores. This made the little available pure aluminium, which had been refined at great expense, more valuable than gold.( Bars of aluminium were exhibited alongside the French jewels at the Exposition Universelle of 1855, and Napoleon IIIs most important guests were given aluminium cutlery, while those less worthy dined with mere silver.(Aluminum: Common Metal, Uncommon Past, Chemical Heritage NewsMagazine, Winter 2007/8, Vol.27, No.4) Additionally, the pyramidal top to the Monument is made of 100 ounces of pure aluminium. At the time of the monuments construction, aluminium was asexpensive as silver.() Over time, however, the price of the metal has dropped; the invention of the process in 1886 caused the high price of aluminium to collapse permanently.Bismuth and telluriumBismuth and tellurium are the only two metals which have abundances less than 10-8 by mass part (g/g) in the Earths crust, but which are currently not of high economic value.

Richmond,_North_Yorkshire
Richmond is a town and civil parish on the Swale in Yorkshire, England and is the administrative centre of the district of Richmondshire. It is situated on the edge of the Dales National Park, and serves as the Parks main tourist centre.(Richmond. Encyclopdia Britannica. Encyclopdia Britannica Online. Encyclopdia Britannica, 2011. Web. 30 Apr. 2011. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/502797/Richmond) It is the most duplicated UK placename, with 57 occurrences worldwide. The Guide describes the entire town as an absolute gem.()()(Richmond Online  Online Guide to Richmond  A brief History. Richmond.org. Retrieved on 2011-05-14.) Betty James wrote that without any doubt Richmond is the most romantic place in the whole of the North East England.(A kingdom by the sea : an exploration of Northumberland, Durham and the North Riding of Yorkshire      James, Betty. p150) Joseph E Morris agreed, although went further to say Richmond is, beyond all question, the most romantic town in the North of England.(The North Riding of Yorkshire      Morris, Joseph E (Joseph Ernest) p300) The town was named the UK town of the year for 2009.HistoryEtymologyThe town of Richemont in Normandy (now in the Seine-Maritime dpartement, Haute-Normandie region) was the origin of the name Richmond.(Curiously the village of Auppegard (Appelgart a. 1160) in the Seine-Maritime dpartement shares the same etymology as Applegarth (Appelgard a. 1160), because of Anglo-Danish farmers who settled in Normandy around the 10th century.) This Richmond was the eponymous honour of the Earls of Richmond (or comtes de Richemont), a dignity normally also held by the of Brittany from 1136 to 1399.Early historyRichmond was founded in 1071(Richmond Online Guide to Richmond, Yorkshire.

Richmond Castle, completed in 1086, consisted of a keep with walls encompassing the area now known as the Market Place.The constitutional ambiguity of Dukes of Brittany as vassals of both Valois France (in right of Brittany) and Plantagenet England (in right of Richmond) was the source of much tension in Breton and Northern English history, particularly during the great War of Succession and of the Roses.Richmond was eventually willed by II, Duke of Brittany to VII of England, whose grandson FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset was independent Richmonds first duke, to distinguish from an earlier junior status as county.  Richmondshires unification with the of Wales and of England into and Wales was part of the same period as the in Wales Acts 15351542, paralleled by the 1532 between Brittany and France, under III, Duke of Brittany.  Richmondshire had previous participation in the of Rhuddlan, during which preceding conflict the Lord of Bedale became a seasoned soldier that aided in his promotion to a Viceroy of Edward I in the Lowlands.  Richmond has been joined with the Marches since the time of Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox and Richmonds relations with Mercia, go back to the time when Earl of Mercia, held the old manor of West (an enclave within Northumbria), that was moved by the Bretons to Richmond. Richmonds inclusion into the royal body politic of England was opposed by locals for over a century, through numerous plots and rebellions, Spanish confederations and Jesuit missions, finally cracking in the Civil War period.  The most notable personages of this faction, were the Lords Baltimore, who had to retreat to Ireland and the American colonies for their peace of religion.The prosperity of the medieval market town and centre of the Swaledale wool industry greatly increased in the late 17th and 18th centuries with the burgeoning lead mining industry in nearby Arkengarthdale. It is from this period that the towns attractive architecture originates, the most notable examples of which are to be found on Newbiggin and in Frenchgate . One of Europes first gas works was built in the town in 1830.( Scottish relations IV, Duke of Brittany married Margaret of Huntingdon, whose brother I of Scotland was prisoner in the castle keep after the of Alnwick (1174).  At the of Old Byland, Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland led an assault on Richmond and this resulted in the capture of of Brittany, Earl of Richmond.  After the last Tudor Richmond, Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox became magnate here.  During the Civil War, the Covenanter Army led by Leslie, Lord Newark, took over the castle; there was conflict between local Catholics and Scottish Presbyterians.Landmarksthumb|left|Richmond CastleCastle situated in the town centre overlooking the River Swale is a major tourist attraction. Scollands Hall is the gatehouse and was staffed by the Lords of Bedale, such as FitzAlan, Lord FitzAlan,  and Stapleton, Founder KG.  Other staff residences were Burton and Steward.  Also, Richmond had an extended Wensleydale castlery initially consisting of Castle, Ravensworth and Snape (FitzHugh & Neville Latymer).  The Conyers, Wyville, Gascoigne, Stapleton and Lovell families were all notable gentry.The cobbled market place is one of the largest in England.(The Howards Regimental Museum is based in the old Trinity Church in the centre of the towns market place; the town is also home to the Museum.  The Theatre Royal, founded in 1788 by the actor, Samuel Butler, is just off the market place. A decline in the fortunes of theatre led to its closure in 1848 and it was used as a warehouse for many years. In 1963 the theatre was restored and reopened, with a theatre museum added in 1979. More recently, the theatre has become the Theatre Royal and was extended in 2003 with the addition of a new block providing services and access next to the original auditorium. It is one of Britains oldest extant theatres.(thumb|right|View from FrenchgateMedia and filmographyRichmond has been used as a filming location for a significant number of TV programmes & films including Fast Show, Falls, Earthfasts, A Woman of Substance (1984) and All Creatures Great and Small amongst others.Radio, the local radio station for the Dales, broadcasts programmes from studios in Richmond.Local newspapers include the weekly Darlington & Stockton Times and the daily Northern Echo.EducationThe town is home to two secondary schools: School- a large school and sixth form college with specialisms in Performing Arts, Science and Maths- and Francis Xavier School, which is a slightly smaller comprehensive for boys and girls aged 1116. There are also three non-sectarian primary schools: Richmond Methodist, Richmond C of E and St Marys Catholic School.EconomyTourism is important to the local economy, but the single largest influence is the Garrison army base, which is rapidly becoming the largest population centre in Richmondshire.(http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/business/news/5021365.Military_presence_brings_massive_benefits_to_North_Yorkshire_economy/)In the town centre there are many independent shops, as well as a small Co-op, H Smith, Boots, Greggs, Peters, Foods and Woollen Mill. There is a large Co-op situated just outside the town centre.The Station food, film and art centre admits 300,000 tourists a year.(http://www.richmondstation.com/) It was formerly Richmond railway station. It has a restaurant, cinema, art gallery and heritage centre, as well as a bakery, cheese-maker, micro brewery, ice-cream parlour, fudge house and honey-maker.(TransportThe stone terminus of Richmond Railway Station, built in a Tudor/Elizabethan style, opened in 1846 and closed in 1968, a year before the branch line itself was taken out of service. After the station closed, the building was used for many years as a garden centre. It has now been renovated by the Richmondshire Building Preservation Trust and opened in late 2007  retitled, simply, The Station  as a mixed-use space for community and commercial activities. The newly-renovated station is home to two cinema screens, an art gallery and a restaurant and caf. There are also artisan food makers on the premises: The Angels Share, Archers Jersey Ice Cream, Laceys Cheese, Richmond Brewing Company and Velvet Heaven. Richmond has a frequent bus service to Darlington and Catterick Garrison, and a wide range of local bus services to nearby towns and villages including Leyburn, Northallerton and Barnard Castle.LegendsNearly 200 years ago some soldiers found an entrance to a tunnel near the castle keep. They could not fit into the tunnel so they elected to send a regimental drummer boy. The boy was asked to walk along the tunnel and beat his drum so that above ground the soldiers could follow the noise. They did this for 3 miles before the sound stopped unexpectedly. This was never explained and today a stone marks the spot the noise stopped. More confusingly the entrance can also not be found. Today schools celebrate this local legend with children marching through town annually. Legend claims that on some cold nights you can hear the faint sound of the drummer boy still.Notable inhabitants*A list of people to have held the position of of Richmond are listed here.*A list of people to have held the position of MP for Richmond are listed here.*A list of people who have been of Richmond.*A list of people who have been of Richmond.*A list of people who have been Bishop of Richmond.Born in Richmond*Andrew, rugby union international.*Ayre-Smith, union international.*George Bell, publisher, founder of Bell & Sons.*Francis Blackburne, archdeacon and dissenter.*Brasse, writer.*William Brice, ethnographer.*and Nathaniel Buck, engravers and printmakers.*Clark, rugby union player.*Cradock, Admiral.(Christopher George Francis Maurice Cradock  Tones Fighting Ships.

Anonymity
Anonymity is derived from the Greek word , anonymia, meaning without a name or namelessness. In colloquial use, anonymity typically refers to the state of an individuals personal identity, or identifiable information, being publicly unknown. There are many reasons why a person might choose to obscure their identity and become anonymous. Several of these reasons are legal, legitimate and socially approved of&mdash;many acts of charity are performed anonymously, as benefactors do not wish, for whatever reason, to be acknowledged for their action.  Someone who feels threatened by someone else might attempt to hide from the threat behind various means of anonymity, a witness to a crime can seek to avoid retribution, for example, by anonymously calling a crime tipline. There are also many illegal reasons to hide behind anonymity. Criminals typically try to keep themselves anonymous either to conceal the fact that a crime has been committed or to avoid capture. Anonymity may also be created unintentionally, through the loss of identifying information due to the passage of time or a destructive event.The term anonymous message typically refers to a message (which is, for example, transmitted over some form of a network) that does not carry any information about its sender and its intended recipient. It is therefore unclear if multiple such messages have been sent by the same sender or if they have the same intended recipient.The problem of determining whether or not the identity of a communication partner is the same as one previously encountered is the problem of authentication. In mathematics, in reference to an arbitrary element (e.g. a human, an object, a computer), within a well-defined set (called the anonymity set), anonymity of that element refers to the property of that element of not being identifiable within this set. If it is not identifiable, then the element is said to be anonymous.Compared with pseudonymitySometimes it is desired that a person can establish a long-term relationship (such as a reputation) with some other entity, without necessarily disclosing identifying information to that entity. In this case, it may be useful for the person to establish a unique identifier, called a pseudonym, with the other entity. Examples of pseudonyms are names, nicknames, credit card numbers, student numbers, bank account numbers, and IP addresses. A pseudonym enables the other entity to link different messages from the same person and, thereby, the maintenance of a long-term relationship. Someone using a pseudonym would be strictly considered to be using pseudonymity not anonymity, but sometimes the term anonymity is used to refer to both (in general, a situation where the legal identity of the person is disguised).Means of obtaining anonymityAnonymity is a result of not having identifying characteristics (such as a name or description of physical appearance) disclosed. This can occur from a lack of interest in learning the nature of such characteristics, or through intentional efforts to hide these characteristics. An example of the former would include a brief encounter with a stranger, when learning the other persons name is not deemed necessary. An example of the latter would include someone hiding behind clothing that covers identifying features like hair color, scars, or tattoos, in order to avoid identification.In some cases, anonymity is reached unintentionally, as is often the case with victims of crimes or war battles, when a body is discovered in such a state that the physical features used to identify someone are no longer present. Anonymity is not always found in such morbid situations, however. As an example, a winner of a lottery jackpot is anonymous (one of however many play the lottery) until that person turns in the winning lottery ticket.Anonymity may also be created through a gradual eroding of ownership information, such as the passage of time and loss of attribution to a saying.  For example, the quote, Ignorance is Bliss originally had a known author, but, over time, information on authors identity was obscured and has disappeared.Anonymity and social situationsAnonymity may reduce the accountability one perceives to have for their actions, and removes the impact these actions might otherwise have on their reputation. This can have dramatic effects, both useful and harmful.In conversational settings, anonymity may allow people to reveal personal history and feelings without fear of later embarrassment. Electronic conversational media can provide physical isolation, in addition to anonymity.  This prevents physical retaliation for remarks, and prevents negative or taboo behavior or discussion from tarnishing the reputation of the speaker. This can be beneficial when discussing very private matters, or taboo subjects or expressing views or revealing facts that may put someone in physical, financial, or legal danger (such as illegal activity, or unpopular, or outlawed political views).With few perceived negative consequences, anonymous or semi-anonymous forums often provide a soapbox for disruptive conversational behavior. The term troll is sometimes used to refer to those who do this online.Relative anonymity is often enjoyed in large crowds. Different people have different psychological and philosophical reactions to this development, especially as a modern phenomenon. This anonymity is an important factor in psychology, and behavior in situations such as a riot.  This perceived anonymity can be compromised by technologies such as photography.Anonymity, commerce and crimeAnonymous commercial transactions can protect the privacy of consumers. Some consumers prefer to use cash when buying everyday goods (like groceries or tools), to prevent sellers from aggregating information or soliciting them in the future. Credit cards are linked to a persons name, and can be used to discover other information, such as postal address, phone number, etc. The ecash system was developed to allow secure anonymous transactions. When purchasing taboo goods and services, anonymity makes many potential consumers more comfortable with or more willing to engage in the transaction. Many programs use cards that personally identify the consumer engaging in each transaction (possibly for later solicitation, or for redemption or security purposes), or that act as a numerical pseudonym, for use in mining.Anonymity can also be used as a protection against legal prosecution. For example, when committing a robbery, many criminals will obscure their faces to avoid identification. In crime, groups of criminals may collaborate on a certain project without revealing to each other their names or other personally identifiable information. The movie The Thomas Crown Affair depicted a fictional collaboration by people who had never previously met and did not know who had recruited them. The anonymous purchase of a gun or knife to be used in a crime helps prevent linking an abandoned weapon to the identity of the perpetrator.Anonymity in charityThere are two aspects, one, giving to a large charitable organization obscures the beneficiary of a donation from the benefactor, the other is giving anonymously to obscure the benefactor both from the beneficiary and from everyone else. There are many reasons this is done. Anonymous charity has long been a widespread and durable moral precept of many ethical and religious systems, as well as being in practice a widespread human activity. A benefactor may not wish to establish any relationship with the beneficiary, particularly if the beneficiary is perceived as being unsavory. Benefactors may not wish to identify themselves as capable of giving. A benefactor may wish to improve the world, as long as no one knows who did it, out of modesty, wishing to avoid publicity.(Donors Increasingly Make Their Big Gifts Anonymously, Chronicle Analysis Finds By Sam Kean (January 09, 2008) The Chronicle of Philanthropy) Issues facing the anonymous Attempts at anonymity are not always met with support from society. There is a trend in society to mistrust someone who makes an effort to maintain their anonymity. This is often summed up in the statement, You wouldnt want to stay anonymous unless you had something to hide. The implication is that there is no legitimate reason to obscure ones identity from the world as a whole. Anonymity sometimes clashes with the policies and procedures of governments or private organizations.  In the United States, disclosure of identity is required to be able to vote, though the ballot prevents disclosure of how individuals voted.  In airports in most countries, passengers are not allowed to board flights unless they have identified themselves to some sort of airline or transportation security personnel, typically in the form of the presentation of an card.On the other hand, some policies and procedures require anonymity. Referring to the anonymous When it is necessary to refer to someone who is anonymous, it is typically necessary to create a type of pseudo-identification for that person. In literature, the most common way to state that the identity of an author is unknown is to refer to them as simply Anonymous. This is usually the case with older texts in which the author is long dead and unable to claim authorship of a work. When the work claims to be that of some famous author the pseudonymous author is identified as Pseudo-, as in the Areopagite, an author claiming&mdash;and long believed&mdash;to be the Areopagite, an early Christian convert.Anonymus, in its Latin spelling, generally with a specific city designation, is traditionally used by scholars in the humanities to refer to an ancient writer whose name is not known, or to a manuscript of their work. Many such writers have left valuable historical or literary records: an incomplete list of such Anonymi is at Anonymus.In the history of art, many painting workshops can be identified by their characteristic style and discussed and the workshops output set in chronological order.  Sometimes archival research later identifies the name, as when the Master of Flmalle&mdash;defined by three paintings in the Stdelsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt&mdash; was identified as Campin. The 20th-century art historian Berenson methodically identified numerous early Renaissance Florentine and Sienese workshops under such sobriquets as Amico di Sandro for an anonymous painter in the immediate circle of Botticelli. In legal cases, a popularly accepted name to use when it is determined that an individual needs to maintain anonymity is Doe. This name is often modified to Doe when the anonymity-seeker is female. The same names are also commonly used when the identification of a dead person is not known. The semi-acronym Unsub is used as law enforcement slang for Unknown Subject of an Investigation.The military often feels a need to honor the remains of soldiers for whom identification is impossible. In many countries, such a memorial is named the of the Unknown Soldier. Anonymity and the press Most modern newspapers and magazines attribute their articles to individual editors, or to news agencies. An exception is the British weekly Economist, which may be the worlds only un-bylined paper.  All British newspapers run their leaders (i.e. editorials) anonymously. Anonymity on the Internet  Most commentary on the Internet is essentially done anonymously, using unidentifiable pseudonyms. While these names can take on an identity of their own, they are frequently separated from and anonymous from the actual author, and according to the University of Stockholm creating more freedom of expression, and less accountability.(Anonymity on the Internet By Jacob Palme and Mikael Berglund - Jacob Palmes Home Page) The online encyclopedia Wikipedia is collaboratively written mostly by authors using either unidentifiable pseudonyms or IP address identifiers, although a few have used identified pseudonyms or their real names.Full anonymity on the Internet, however, is not guaranteed since IP addresses, in principle, can be tracked, allowing to identify the computer from which a certain post was made, albeit not the actual user. Anonymizing services such as I2P - The Anonymous Network or Tor address the issue of IP tracking. Their distributed technology approach may grant a higher degree of security than centralized anonymizing services where a central point exists that could disclose ones identity.Sites such as Chatroulette and Omegle capitalize on the current fascination with anonymity.  They are examples of anonymous chat or chat. Other sites, however, including Facebook and Google+, require users to sign in with their legal names. In the case of Google+, this requirement has led to a controversy known as the nymwars.Anonymity and politicsFile:Pasquino 02.jpg|thumb|Modern pasquinades glued to the base of Pasquino, one of the Statues of Rome.The history of anonymous expression in political dissent is both long and with important effect, as in the of Junius or Voltaires Candide,  or scurrilous as in pasquinades. In the tradition of anonymous British political criticism, the Papers  were anonymously authored.  Without the public discourse on the controversial contents of the Constitution, ratification would likely have taken much longer as individuals worked through the issues.  The States Declaration of Independence, however, was not anonymous.  If it had been unsigned, it might well have been less effective.  Perry Barlow, Ito, and other US bloggers express a very strong support for anonymous editing as one of the basic requirements of politics as conducted on the Internet.(The Infrastructure of Democracy) Saipansucks.com is an example of an anonymously written website that socially and politically criticizes the United States of the Northern Mariana Islands, and UticaSux.com politically criticizes the local government of New York, in the United States.Anonymity and pseudonymity in artAnonymity is directly related to the concept of obscurantism or pseudonymity, where an artist or group attempts to remain anonymous, for various reasons, not limited to: adding an element of mystique to themselves and/or their work, attempting to avoid what is known as the of personality or hero worship, where the charisma, good looks, wealth and/or other unrelated or mildly related aspects of the person(s) is the main reason for interest in their work, rather than the work itself; also the ability to break into a field or area of interest normally dominated by males, such as Tiptree, Jr, the famous fiction author who was actually a woman named Alice Bradley Sheldon, as seems to also be the case with LeRoy.  The reasons for choosing this approach vary.  Some, such as Pynchon, and D. Salinger who seem to want to avoid the limelight of popularity or simply want to live private lives.  Some others include Residents, and until 2004, musician Jandek.This is frequently applied in fiction, from Lone Ranger, Superman, and Batman, where a hidden identity is assumed.Mathematics of anonymityAn example: Suppose that only Alice, Bob, and Carol have the keys to a bank safe and that, one day, the contents of the safe are missing (without the lock being violated). Without any additional information, we do not know for sure whether it was Alice, Bob or Carol who opened the safe; the perpetrator remains anonymous. In particular, each of the elements in {Alice, Bob, Carol} has a 1/3 chance of being the perpetrator. However, as long as none of them has been identified as being the perpetrator with 100% certainty, we can say that the perpetrator remains anonymous.Anonymity is not an absolute. That is, the degree of anonymity one enjoys may vary. In the above example, if Carol has an ironclad alibi at the time of the perpetration, then we may deduce that it must have been either Alice or Bob who opened the safe. That is, the probability of the elements {Alice, Bob, Carol} of being the perpetrator is now 1/2, 1/2, and 0, respectively. This clearly amounts to a reduction of the perpetrators anonymity (i.e., although the perpetrator still remains anonymous, it is now more likely than before that (s)he is either Alice or Bob).See also* I2P* application* web browsing* of anonymously published works* P2P* Friend-to-friend* P2P* identifiable information* Pseudonymity, Pseudonymization* Doe* Crypto-anarchism* privacy* software* FLAIM* (group)* Anon ProxyReferences(ar:az:Anonimca:Anonimatcs:Anonymitada:Anonymitetde:Anonymittet:Anonmsuses:Anonimatofr:Anonymatko:hy:hi:id:Anonimitasit:Anonimatohu:Anonimitsnl:Anonimiteitja:no:Anonymitetpl:Anonimowopt:Anonimatoru:simple:Anonymitysv:Anonymitetuk:yi:zh:

Trench_warfare
Trench warfare is a form of occupied fighting lines, consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are largely immune to the enemys arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. It has become a byword for warfare, for stalemate in conflict, with a slow wearing down of opposing forces.()Trench warfare occurred when a military revolution in firepower was not matched by similar advances in mobility, resulting in a grueling form of warfare in which the defense held the advantage. In War I, both sides constructed elaborate trench and dugout systems opposing each other along a front, protected from assault by wire. The area between opposing trench lines (known as mans land) was fully exposed to artillery fire from both sides. Attacks, even if successful, often sustained severe casualties as a matter of course. Overview Field worksField works are as old as armies. Roman legions when in the presence of an enemy entrenched camps nightly on the move. Similar measures, from Frederic the Greats camp at Bunzelwitz, to Wellesleys with his defense at Torres Vedras, to the French of Weissenburg, were frequently used.(George Ripley, Anderson Dana, The New American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary of General Knowledge, Appleton & Company, 1859,  p. 622, (a work in the public domain) )Nor were fortifications restricted to European powers. Elaborate trench and bunker systems were independently developed by the Maori, who successfully employed by them as early as the 1840s to withstand British cannon, muskets, and an experimental poison-gas mortar,() in the Zealand Wars.() British casualty rates of up to 45 per cent, such as at the of Ohaeawai in 1845, proved contemporary firepower was insufficient to dislodge defenders from a trench system.()File:Boer Trench.jpg|thumb|left|The Boer trench at the of Magersfontein contributed to the surprise defeat of the Highland Brigade on 11 December 1899 during the Boer War.Field works were later employed on an even larger scale in the Civil War, the Anglo-Boer War, and the War. Fundamentally, as the range and rate of fire of rifled small arms increased, a defender shielded from enemy fire (in a trench, house window, behind a large rock, or behind other cover) was often able to kill several approaching foes before they closed with his position. This was only made more lethal by the introduction of rapid-firing artillery, exemplified by the French 75, and explosive fragmentation rounds. The increases in firepower had outstripped the ability of infantry to cover the ground between firing lines, and the ability of armor to withstand fire, even for cavalry. It would take a revolution in mobility to change that.(Dyer, Gwynn. War; Dupuy, Trevor N. Evolution of Weapons and Warfare)Trench warfare is strongly associated with World War I, when it was employed on the Western Front from September 1914(Ellis, p 10) until the last weeks of the war. By the end of October 1914 the whole front in Belgium and France had solidified into lines of trenches, as it became clear infantry assaults were futile in the face of artillery fire as well as rapid rifle and machine gun fire. Both sides concentrated on breaking up enemy attacks and on protecting their own troops by digging deep into the ground.(Ellis, p.4) Trench warfare was also conducted on other fronts, including Italy and Gallipoli.Symbol for the futility of warTrench warfare has become a powerful symbol of the futility of war.(Griffith (1996), p 4) Its image is of young men going over the top (over the parapet of the trench, to attack the enemy trench line) into a maelstrom of fire leading to certain death, typified by the first day of the Somme (on which the British suffered 57,000 casualties) or the grinding slaughter in the mud of Passchendaele. To the French, the equivalent is the attrition of the of Verdun in which they suffered 380,000 casualties.(Lavalle, John in World War I &ndash; a student encyclopaedia, ABC-Clio, 2006, p 1886)Trench warfare is associated with needless slaughter in appalling conditions, combined with the view that brave men went to their deaths because of incompetent and narrow-minded commanders who failed to adapt to the new conditions of trench warfare: class-ridden and backward-looking generals put their faith in the attack, believing superior morale and dash would overcome the weapons and moral inferiority of the defender.(Ellis, pp 80&ndash;87) The British and Empire troops on the Western Front are commonly referred to as led by donkeys.(Griffith (1996), pp 5&ndash;6) This view persisted in the Japanese Army in World War II.(Edgerton, Robert B. Warriors of the Rising Sun (New York:  W. W. Norton, 1997); Coox, Alvin D., & Hayashi, Saburo. Kogun (Quantico:  Marine Corps Association, 1959).)In fact the picture is far more complex. It is easy to find examples of backward and inflexible generals early in World War I. There were failures such as Passchendaele, and Sir Douglas Haig is criticised for allowing his battles to continue long after they had lost any purpose other than attrition.(Griffith (1996), p 10) Trench raiding and patrolling led to high casualties.(Ellis, pp 73&ndash;79) There was an emphasis on seeking breakthroughs, rather than being content with bite and hold battles. Yet there were also tactical and technical innovations. The problems of trench warfare were recognized, and attempts were made to address them. Solutions included improvements in artillery, better infantry tactics and the development of tanks. The lessons of the first day of the Somme were learned very quickly, and by 1918 attacks were generally more successful and suffered fewer casualties; in the hundred days there was even a return to mobile warfare. The Allies eventually achieved a decisive victory.In Britain, the reputations of the generals suffered from postwar attacks by prominent politicians deflecting blame from their own conduct of the war, from tactical experts promoting their own reputations and from nationalistic commentators from Empire nations blaming their British commanders for their losses.(Griffith (1996), pp 7&ndash;8) The Germans fared no better than the Allies.(Griffith (1996), pp.3&ndash;10)World War I: Entrenchment Implementationthumb|left|German western front 1915, German forward detachments guarding the entrance to a trench line in front of ArrasImage:Cheshire Regiment trench Somme 1916.jpg|thumb|right|Trenches of the 11th Regiment at Ovillers-la-Boisselle, on the Somme, July 1916.

Photo by Ernest Brooks.Image:Lancashire Fusiliers trench Beaumont Hamel 1916.jpg|thumb|right|1st Lancashire Fusiliers, in communication trench near Hamel, Somme, 1916. Photo by Ernest Brooks.Although technology had dramatically changed the nature of warfare by 1914, the armies of the major combatants had not correctly anticipated the implications. The French and German armies adopted dramatically different tactical doctrines. The French relied on the attack with speed and surprise. The Germans relied on firepower, investing heavily in howitzers and guns. The British lacked a coherent tactical doctrine, with an officer corps that rejected theory in favour of pragmatism.(Bidwell & Graham pp 14&ndash;19)While the armies expected to use entrenchments and cover, they did not allow for the effect of defences in depth. They required a deliberate approach to seizing positions from which fire support could be given for the next phase of the attack, rather than a rapid move to break the enemys line.(Bidwell & Graham p 27) Critically, it was assumed that artillery could still destroy entrenched troops, or at least suppress them sufficiently for friendly infantry and cavalry to manoeuvre.(Bidwell & Graham pp 24&ndash;25)In the face of modern firepower, digging in was standard practice by the start of World War I. To attack frontally was to court crippling losses, so an outflanking operation was the preferred method of attack against an entrenched enemy. After the Battle of the Aisne in September 1914, an extended series of attempted flanking moves, and matching extensions to the fortified defensive lines, soon saw the celebrated race to the sea; German and Allied armies produced a matched pair of trench lines from the Swiss border in the south to the Sea coast of Belgium.Trench warfare prevailed on the Western Front from 16 September 1914 until the Germans launched their Spring Offensive on 21 March 1918. After the buildup of forces in 1915, the Western Front became a deadlocked struggle between equals, to be decided by attrition. Frontal assaults, and their associated casualties, became inevitable because the continuous trench lines had no open flanks. Casualties of the defenders matched those of the attackers, as vast reserves were expended in costly counter-attacks or exposed to the attackers massed artillery. There were periods in which rigid trench warfare broke down, such as during the of the Somme, but the lines never moved very far. The war would be won by the side that was able to commit the last reserves to the Western Front.(Bidwell & Graham pp &ndash;25)Early trenches were simple. They lacked traverses, and according to pre-war doctrine were to be packed with men fighting shoulder to shoulder, leading to heavy casualties from artillery fire. This, and the length of the front to be defended, soon led to front line trenches being held by fewer men. In addition to the trenches themselves,  barbed wire was strung up to impede movement, and wiring parties went out every night to improve these forward defences.(Griffith (2004), pp 10&ndash;11)The small, improvised trenches of the first few months grew deeper and more complex, gradually becoming vast areas of interlocking defensive works. They resisted both artillery bombardments and mass infantry assaults. Shell-proof dugouts became a high priority.(Griffith (2004), p 11) The space between the opposing trenches was referred to as no mans land and varied in width depending on the battlefield. On the Western Front it was typically between 100 and 300 yards (90275 m), though only 30 yards (27 m) on Vimy Ridge.After the German withdrawal to the line in March 1917, it stretched to over a kilometre in places. At the infamous Quinns Post in the cramped confines of the Anzac battlefield at Gallipoli, the opposing trenches were only 16 yards (15 m) apart and grenades were thrown constantly. On the Eastern Front and in the Middle East, the areas to be covered were so vast, and the distances from the factories supplying shells, bullets, concrete and barbed wire so great, trench warfare in the West European style often did not occur.In the Alps, trench warfare even stretched onto vertical slopes and deep into the mountains, to heights of 3900 m (12795 ft) above sea level. The Ortler had an artillery position on its summit near the front line. The trench-line management and trench profiles had to be adapted to the rough terrain, hard rock, and harsh weather conditions. Many trench systems were constructed within glaciers like the Adamello-Presanella group or the famous below the ice on the Marmolada in the Dolomites.Trench defensive systemsVery early in the war, British defensive doctrine suggested a main trench system of three parallel lines, interconnected by communications trenches. The point at which a communications trench intersected the front trench was of critical importance, and it was usually heavily fortified. The front trench was lightly garrisoned and typically only occupied in force during stand to at dawn and dusk. Between 70 and 100 yards (6491 m) behind the front trench was located the support (or travel) trench, to which the garrison would retreat when the front trench was bombarded.Between 300 and 500 yards (275460 m) further to the rear was located the third reserve trench, where the reserve troops could amass for a counter-attack if the front trenches were captured. This defensive layout was soon rendered obsolete as the power of artillery grew; however, in certain sectors of the front, the support trench was maintained as a decoy to attract the enemy bombardment away from the front and reserve lines. Fires were lit in the support line to make it appear inhabited and any damage done immediately repaired.thumb|Aerial view of opposing trench lines between Loos and Hulluch, July 1917. German trenches at the right and bottom, British at the top-left.Temporary trenches were also built. When a major attack was planned, assembly trenches would be dug near the front trench. These were used to provide a sheltered place for the waves of attacking troops who would follow the first waves leaving from the front trench. Saps were temporary, unmanned, often dead-end utility trenches dug out into no-mans land. They fulfilled a variety of purposes, such as connecting the front trench to a listening post close to the enemy wire or providing an advance jumping-off line for a surprise attack. When one sides front line bulged towards the opposition, a salient was formed. The concave trench line facing the salient was called a re-entrant. Large salients were perilous for their occupants because they could be assailed from three sides.Behind the front system of trenches there were usually at least two more partially prepared trench systems, kilometres to the rear, ready to be occupied in the event of a retreat. The Germans often prepared multiple redundant trench systems; in 1916 their Somme front featured two complete trench systems, one kilometer apart, with a third partially completed system a further kilometer behind. This duplication made a decisive breakthrough virtually impossible. In the event that a section of the first trench system was captured, a switch trench would be dug to connect the second trench system to the still-held section of the first.The Germans, who had based their knowledge on studies of the War,(Keegan, p. 179) made something of a science out of designing and constructing defensive works. They used reinforced concrete to construct deep, shell-proof, ventilated dugouts, as well as strategic strongpoints. They were more willing than their opponents to make a strategic withdrawal to a superior prepared defensive position. They were also the first to apply the concept of defense in depth, where the front-line zone was hundreds of yards deep and contained a series of redoubts rather than a continuous trench. Each redoubt could provide supporting fire to its neighbours, and while the attackers had freedom of movement between the redoubts, they would be subjected to withering enfilade fire.The British eventually adopted a similar approach, but it was incompletely implemented when the Germans launched the 1918 Spring Offensive and proved disastrously ineffective. France, by contrast, relied on artillery and reserves, not entrenchment. The characteristic barbed wire placed before trenches, in belts 15 m (50 ft) deep or more, differed, too; the German wire was heavier gauge, and British wire cutters, designed for the thinner native product, were unable to cut it.(Canadas Army, p.79.)Trench constructionthumb|right|Trench construction diagram from a 1914 British infantry manualFighting trenches were usually about  deep. Trenches were never straight but were dug in a zigzagging or stepped pattern. Later fighting trenches broke the line into firebays connected by traverses. This meant that a soldier could never see more than  or so along the trench. Consequently, the entire trench could not be enfiladed if the enemy gained access at one point; or if a bomb or shell landed in the trench, the blast could not travel far.The banked earth on the lip of the trench facing the enemy was called the parapet and had a fire step. The embanked rear lip of the trench was called the parados. The parados protected the soldiers back from shells falling behind the trench. The sides of the trench were often revetted with sandbags, wooden frames and wire mesh. The floor of the trench was usually covered by wooden duckboards. In later designs the floor might be raised on a wooden frame to provide a drainage channel underneath.Dugouts of varying degrees of luxury would be built in the rear of the support trench. British dugouts were usually  deep, whereas German dugouts were typically much deeper, usually a minimum of  deep and sometimes dug three stories down, with concrete staircases to reach the upper levels.Image:Periscope rifle Gallipoli 1915.jpg|thumb|left|light horseman using a rifle, Gallipoli 1915To allow a soldier to see out of the trench without exposing his head, a loophole could be built into the parapet. A loophole might simply be a gap in the sandbags, or it might be fitted with a steel plate. German snipers used armour-piercing bullets that allowed them to penetrate loopholes. Another means to see over the parapet was the trench periscope&mdash;in its simplest form, just a stick with two angled pieces of mirror at the top and bottom. In the Anzac trenches at Gallipoli, where the Turks held the high ground, the rifle was developed to enable the Australians and New Zealanders to snipe at the enemy without exposing themselves over the parapet.There were three standard ways to dig a trench: entrenching, sapping, and tunneling. Entrenching, where a man would stand on the surface and dig downwards, was most efficient, as it allowed a large digging party to dig the full length of the trench simultaneously. However, entrenching left the diggers exposed above ground and hence could only be carried out when free of observation, such as in a rear area or at night. Sapping involved extending the trench by digging away at the end face. The diggers were not exposed, but only one or two men could work on the trench at a time.Tunneling was like sapping except that a roof of soil was left in place while the trench line was established and then removed when the trench was ready to be occupied. The guidelines for British trench construction stated that it would take 450 men 6 hours at night to complete 250 m (275yd) of front-line trench system. Thereafter, the trench would require constant maintenance to prevent deterioration caused by weather or shelling.thumb|Breastwork trench, Armentires, 1916The battlefield of Flanders presented numerous problems for the practice of trench warfare, especially for the Allied forces, mainly British and Canadians, who were often compelled to occupy the low ground. Heavy shelling quickly destroyed the network of ditches and water channels which had previously drained this low-lying area of Belgium. In most places, the table was only a meter or so below the surface, meaning that any trench dug in the ground would quickly flood.Consequently, many trenches in Flanders were actually above ground and constructed from massive breastworks of sandbags filled with clay. Initially, both the parapet and parados of the trench were built in this way, but a later technique was to dispense with the parados for much of the trench line, thus exposing the rear of the trench to fire from the reserve line in case the front was breached.Trench geography in World War Ithumb|right|A modern map with the frontline close to Roclincourt highlighted in green.The confined, static, and subterranean nature of trench warfare resulted in it developing its own peculiar form of geography. In the forward zone, the conventional transport infrastructure of roads and rail were replaced by the network of trenches and light tramways. The critical advantage that could be gained by holding the high ground meant that minor hills and ridges gained enormous significance. Many slight hills and valleys were so subtle as to have been nameless until the front line encroached upon them. Some hills were named for their height in meters, such as Hill 60. A farmhouse, windmill, quarry, or copse of trees would become the focus of a determined struggle simply because it was the largest identifiable feature. However, it would not take the artillery long to obliterate it, so that thereafter it became just a name on a map.Battlefield features could be given a descriptive name (Wood near Ypres or Lone Pine), a whimsical name (Valley and Mash Valley on the Somme), a unit name (Inniskilling Inch at Helles named for the Inniskilling Fusiliers) or the name of a soldier (Monash Valley at Anzac named after General Monash). Prefixing a feature with Dead Mans was also popular for obvious reasons, such as Dead Mans Road leading in to Pozires, or Dead Mans Ridge at Anzac.There were numerous trench networks named The Chessboard or The Gridiron because of the pattern they described. For the Australians at Mouquet Farm, the advances were so short and the terrain so featureless that they were reduced to naming their objectives as points on the map, such as Point 81 and Point 55.Enemy trenches, which would become objectives in an attack, needed to be named as well. Many were named for some observed event such as German Officers Trench at Anzac or Ration Trench on the Somme. The British gave an alcoholic flavour to the German trenches in front of Ginchy: Beer Trench, Bitter Trench, Hop Trench, Ale Alley, and Pilsen Trench. Other objectives were named according to their role in the trench system, such as the Switch Trench and Intermediate Trench on the Somme.Some sections of the British trench system read like a Monopoly board, with names such as Park Lane and Bond Street. British regular divisions habitually named their trenches after units, which resulted in names such as Munster Alley (Munster Fusiliers), Black Watch Alley (Black Watch Regiment) and Border Barricade (Regiment). The Anzacs tended to name features after soldiers (Plugges Plateau, Walkers Ridge, Quinns Post, Johnstons Jolly, Russells Top, Brinds Road and so forth).World War I: Life in the trenchesthumb|French trench at Cte 304, Verdun, 1916Soap WW 1 Ad.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for Sunlight Soap in the trenches (1915)An individual units time in the front-line trench was usually brief; from as little as one day to as much as two weeks at a time before being relieved. The Australian 31st Battalion once spent 53 days in the line at Villers Bretonneux, but such a duration was a rare exception. The Battalion, CEF, averaged front line tours of six days in 1915 and 1916.(1915 history)On an individual level, a typical British soldiers year could be divided as follows:*15% front line*10% support line*30% reserve line*20% rest*25% other (hospital, travelling, leave, training courses, etc.)Even when in the front line, the typical battalion would only be called upon to engage in fighting a handful of times a year&mdash;making an attack, defending against an attack or participating in a raid. The frequency of combat would increase for the units of the elite fighting divisions&mdash;on the Allied side; the British regular divisions, the Corps, the French XX Corps and the Anzacs.left|thumb|Studying French in the Trenches, The Literary Digest, October 20, 1917.Some sectors of the front saw little activity throughout the war, making life in the trenches comparatively easy. When the Anzac Corps first arrived in France in April 1916 after the evacuation of Gallipoli, they were sent to a relatively peaceful sector south of Armentires to acclimatise. Other sectors were in a perpetual state of violent activity. On the Western Front, Ypres was invariably hellish, especially for the British in the exposed, overlooked salient. However, quiet sectors still amassed daily casualties through sniper fire, artillery, disease, and poison gas. In the first six months of 1916, before the launch of the Somme Offensive, the British did not engage in any significant battles on their sector of the Western Front and yet suffered 107,776 casualties. About 1 in 2 men would return alive and unwounded from the trenches.(http://www.youtube.com/watch?vNpH5I6EA1t0  Jay Winter Lecture- Sites of Mourning)A sector of the front would be allocated to an army corps, usually comprising three divisions. Two divisions would occupy adjacent sections of the front and the third would be in rest to the rear. This breakdown of duty would continue down through the army structure, so that within each front-line division, typically comprising three infantry brigades (regiments for the Germans), two brigades would occupy the front and the third would be in reserve. Within each front-line brigade, typically comprising four battalions, two battalions would occupy the front with two in reserve. And so on for companies and platoons. The lower down the structure this division of duty proceeded, the more frequently the units would rotate from front-line duty to support or reserve.thumb|275px|A barber in a French trenchDuring the day, snipers and observers in balloons made movement perilous, so the trenches were mostly quiet. Consequently, trenches were busiest at night, when cover of darkness allowed the movement of troops and supplies, the maintenance and expansion of the barbed wire and trench system, and reconnaissance of the enemys defenses. Sentries in listening posts out in no mans land would try to detect enemy patrols and working parties or indications that an attack was being prepared.Pioneered by the Patricias Canadian Light Infantry in February 1915,(Canadas Army, p.82.) trench raids were carried out in order to capture prisoners and booty&mdash;letters and other documents to provide intelligence about the unit occupying the opposing trenches. As the war progressed, raiding became part of the general British policy, the intention being to maintain the fighting spirit of the troops and to deny no mans land to the Germans. As well, they were intended to compel the enemy to reinforce, which exposed his troops to artillery fire.(Such dominance was achieved at a high cost when the enemy replied with his own artillery,( and a post-war British analysis concluded the benefits were probably not worth the cost. Early in the war, surprise raids would be mounted, particularly by the Canadians, but increased vigilance made achieving surprise difficult as the war progressed. By 1916, raids were carefully planned exercises in combined arms and involved close co-operation of infantry and artillery.A raid would begin with an intense artillery bombardment designed to drive off or kill the front-trench garrison and cut the barbed wire. Then the bombardment would shift to form a box barrage, or cordon, around a section of the front line to prevent a counter-attack intercepting the raid. However, the bombardment also had the effect of notifying the enemy of the location of the planned attack, thus allowing reinforcements to be called in from wider sectors.World War I: Death in the trenches The intensity of World War I trench warfare meant about 10% of the fighting soldiers were killed. This compared to 5% killed during the Boer War and 4.5% killed during World War II. For British and Dominion troops serving on the Western Front, the proportion of troops killed was 12.5%, while the total proportion of troops who became casualties (killed or wounded) was 56%.Medical services were primitive and antibiotics had not yet been discovered. Relatively minor injuries could prove fatal through onset of infection and gangrene. The Germans recorded that 15% of leg wounds and 25% of arm wounds resulted in death, mainly through infection. The Americans recorded 44% of casualties who developed gangrene died. 50% of those wounded in the head died and 99% of those wounded in the abdomen died. 75% of wounds came from shell fire. A wound resulting from a shell fragment was usually more traumatic than a gunshot wound.A shell fragment would often introduce debris, making it more likely that the wound would become infected. These factors meant a soldier was three times more likely to die from a shell wound to the chest than from a gunshot wound. The blast from shell explosions could also kill by concussion. In addition to the physical effects of shell fire, there was the psychological damage. Men who had to endure prolonged bombardment would often suffer debilitating shell shock, a condition not well understood at the time.As in many other wars, World War Is greatest killer was disease. Sanitary conditions in the trenches were quite poor, and common infections included dysentery, typhus, and cholera. Many soldiers suffered from parasites and related infections. Poor hygiene also led to fungal conditions, such as trench mouth and foot. Another common killer was exposure, since the temperature within a trench in the winter could easily fall below freezing. Burial of the dead was usually a luxury that neither side could easily afford. The bodies would lie in no mans land until the front line moved, by which time the bodies were often unidentifiable. On some battlefields, such as at the Nek in Gallipoli, the bodies were not buried until after the war. On the Western Front, bodies continue to be found as fields are ploughed and building foundations dug.thumb|Stretcher bearers, Passchendaele, August 1917At various times during the war&mdash;particularly early on&mdash;official truces were organised so that the wounded could be recovered from no mans land and the dead could be buried. Generally, senior commands disapproved of any slackening of the offensive for humanitarian reasons and so ordered their troops not to permit enemy stretcher-bearers to operate in no mans land. However, this order was almost invariably ignored by the soldiers in the trenches, who knew that it was to the mutual benefit of the fighting men of both sides to allow the wounded to be retrieved. So, as soon as hostilities ceased, parties of stretcher bearers, marked with Red Cross flags, would go out to recover the wounded, sometimes swapping enemy wounded for their own.There were occasions when this unofficial cease fire was exploited to conduct a reconnaissance or to reinforce or relieve a garrison. One famous truce was the truce between British and German soldiers in the winter of 1914 on the front near Armentieres. German soldiers began singing Christmas carols and soon soldiers left their trenches. The soldiers exchanged gifts and stories, and played several games of football. As mentioned previously, the commanders of the warring nations disapproved of this cease fire, and the British court-martialed several of their soldiers. The spirit of this truce is portrayed in the 2005 movie Merry Christmas.Weapons of World War I trench warfareInfantry weaponsThe common infantry soldier had four weapons to use in the trenches: the rifle, bayonet, shotgun, and grenade. The standard issue British rifle was the .303 Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield (SMLE), originally developed as a cavalry carbine, with a maximum range of 1400yd (1280 m). The rifle was widely used by the Corps early in the war and was reputedly more accurate than the British SMLE. However, it proved notoriously unreliable under battlefield conditions, often jamming when dirty or fired rapidly, and was gradually discarded for routine use in favour of the SMLE, except for sniping. Early in the war, the British were able to defeat German attacks at Mons and the Battle of Ypres with massed rifle fire, but as trench warfare developed, opportunities to assemble a line of riflemen disappeared.The German counterpart to the Lee-Enfield was the 7.92x57mm (.323) Mauser 98. It was less suited to rapid fire than the SMLE, due to its smaller magazine and slower of fire. The British soldier was equipped with a 21-inch (53 cm) bayonet, which was too long and unwieldy to be particularly effective in close-quarters combat. However, bayonet use was safer than firing the rifle which, in a mle, might strike an ally instead of an enemy. British figures recorded only 0.3% of wounds were caused by bayonets. The bayonet was also used to finish off wounded enemy soldiers during an advance, both saving ammunition and reducing the probability of being attacked from the rear. Imperial German soldiers generally carried the S98/05 Butcher-blade bayonet, which was an effective weapon in the open, but like the British bayonet, difficult to use in the narrow trenches when attached to a rifle.  thumb|Chateau Wood, Ypres, 1917A specialized group of fighters called trench sweepers (Nettoyeurs de Tranches or Zigouilleurs) evolved to fight within the trenches.  They cleared surviving enemy personnel from recently overrun trenches and made clandestine raids into enemy trenches to gather intelligence.  Volunteers for this dangerous work were often exempted from participation in frontal assaults over open ground and from routine work like filling sandbags, draining trenches, and repairing barbed wire in no-mans land.  When allowed to choose their own weapons, many selected grenades, knives and pistols.  M1900 pistols were highly regarded for this work, but never available in adequate quantities.  Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless, Model 1907, Bonifacio Echeverria and pistols were widely used.(Vanderlinden, Anthony Rifleman (October 2008) pp.91120) According to the semi-biographical War-Novel quiet on the Western Front, many soldiers preferred to use a sharpened folding spade as a improvised melee weapon instead of the bayonet, as the bayonet tended to be stuck in stabbed opponents, rendering it useless in heated battle. The shorter length also made them easier to use in the confined quarters of the trenches. These tools could then be used to dig in after they had taken a trench. Since the troops were often not adequately equipped for trench warfare, improvised weapons were common in the first encounters, such as short wooden clubs and metal maces, as well as knives and knuckles. As the war progressed, better equipment was issued, and improvised arms were discarded.Used by American soldiers in the Western front, the action shotgun was a formidable weapon in short range combat, enough so that Germany lodged a formal protest against their use on 14 September 1918, stating every prisoner found to have in his possession such guns or ammunition belonging thereto forfeits his life, though this threat was apparently never carried out. The U.S. military began to issue models specially modified for combat, called trench guns, with shorter barrels, higher capacity magazines, no choke, and often heat shields around the barrel, as well as lugs for the bayonet. Anzac and some British soldiers were also known to use shotguns in trench raids, because of their portability, effectiveness at close range, and ease of use in the confines of a trench. This practice was not officially sanctioned, and the shotguns used were invariably modified sporting guns.The hand grenade came to be the primary infantry weapon of trench warfare. Both sides were quick to raise specialist bombing squads. The grenade enabled a soldier to engage the enemy without exposing himself to fire, and it did not require precise accuracy to kill or maim.  Another benefit was that if a soldier could get close enough to the trenches, enemies hiding in trenches could be attacked. The Germans and Turks were well equipped with grenades from the start of the war, but the British, who had ceased using grenadiers in the 1870s and did not anticipate a siege war, entered the conflict with virtually none, so soldiers had to improvise bombs with whatever was available (see Tin Grenade). By late 1915, the British bomb had entered wide circulation, and by the end of the war 75 million had been used.TanksTanks were first introduced by the British as a means to break the deadlock of trench warfare. They were first deployed at the Battle of Somme in limited numbers. They proved unreliable and ineffective at first, largely because of poor strategic and tactical planning, being spread too thinly on the ground. In addition, they were originally used over ground torn apart by large amounts of shell fire, which early tanks had trouble traversing. Later on, improved tanks and tactics allowed them to break through enemy lines to become a significant element of warfare.Machine gunsThe Germans embraced the machine gun from the outset&mdash;in 1904, sixteen units were equipped with Maschinengewehr&mdash;and the machine gun crews were the elite infantry units; these units were attached to Jaeger (light infantry) battalions. By 1914, British infantry units were armed with two machine guns per battalion, the Germans had six per battalion, the Russians eight.() The Americans had to wait until 1917 to see every infantry unit carry at least one machine gun.() After 1915, the 08 was the standard issue German machine gun; its number 08/15 entered the German language as idiomatic for dead plain. At Gallipoli and in Palestine the Turks provided the infantry, but it was usually Germans who manned the machine guns.The British High Command were less enthusiastic about machine guns, supposedly considering the weapon too unsporting and encouraging defensive fighting; and they lagged behind the Germans in adopting it. Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig is quoted as saying in 1915, The machine gun is a much overrated weapon; two per battalion is more than sufficient,(http://history.enotes.com/peoples-chronology/year-1916) an attitude which resulted in record numbers of British casualties.(http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/machineguns.htm) In 1915 the Machine Gun Corps was formed to train and provide sufficient heavy machine gun teams.It was the Canadians that made the best practice, pioneering denial and fire (soon adopted by all Allied armies) under the guidance of former French Army Reserve officer Major General Brutinel. Minutes before the attack on Vimy Ridge the Canadians thickened the artillery barrage by aiming machine guns at the precise angle to rain down on the Germans. They also significantly increased the number of machine guns per battalion. To match demand, production of the Vickers machine gun was contracted to firms in the United States. By 1917, every company in the British forces were also equipped with four Lewis light machine guns, which significantly enhanced their firepower.Image:Vickers IWW.jpg|thumb|machine gunThe heavy machine gun was a specialist weapon, and in a static trench system was employed in a scientific manner, with carefully calculated fields of fire, so that at a moments notice an accurate burst could be fired at the enemys parapet or a break in the wire. Equally it could be used as light artillery in bombarding distant trenches. Heavy machine guns required teams of up to eight men to move them, maintain them, and keep them supplied with ammunition. This made them impractical for offensive maneuvers, contributing to the stalemate on the Western Front.MortarsMortars, which lobbed a shell in a high arc over a relatively short distance, were widely used in trench fighting for harassing the forward trenches, for cutting wire in preparation for a raid or attack, and for destroying dugouts, saps and other entrenchments. In 1914, the British fired a total of 545 mortar shells; in 1916, they fired over 6,500,000.  Similarly, howitzers, which fire on a more direct arc than mortars, raised in number from over 1,000 shells in 1914, to over 4,500,000 in 1916. The smaller numerical difference in mortar rounds, as opposed to howitzer rounds, is presumed to be related to the expanded costs of manufacturing the larger and more resource intensive howitzer rounds.The main British mortar was the Stokes, a precursor of the modern mortar. It was a light mortar, but was easy to use, and capable of a rapid rate of fire by virtue of the propellant cartridge being attached to the shell. To fire the Stokes mortar, the round was simply dropped into the tube, where the cartridge was ignited automatically when it struck the firing pin at the bottom. The Germans used a range of mortars. The smallest were grenade-throwers (Granatenwerfer) which fired pineapple bombs. Their medium trench-mortars were called mine-throwers (Minenwerfer), dubbed moaning minnies by British Commonwealth troops. The heavy mortar was called the Ladungswerfer, which threw aerial torpedoes, containing a 200 lb (90 kg) charge to a range of 1000yd (914 m). The flight of the missile was so slow and leisurely men on the receiving end could make some attempt to seek shelter.ArtilleryArtillery dominated the battlefields of trench warfare. An infantry attack was rarely successful if it advanced beyond the range of its supporting artillery. In addition to bombarding the enemy infantry in the trenches, the artillery could be used to precede infantry advances with a creeping barrage, or engage in counter-battery duels to try to destroy the enemys guns. Artillery mainly fired fragmentation, high explosive, or, later in the war, gas shells. The British experimented with firing thermite incendiary shells to set trees and ruins alight. However, all armies had experienced shell shortages during the first year or two of World War I, due to under-estimating their usage under intensive combat.  A knowledge that the combatant nations had already learned from the War in 19041905, but had failed to capitalize on; when daily artillery fire consumed ten times more than daily factory output.(Keegan, p. 229 & 230)thumb|Loading a 15-inch howitzerArtillery pieces were of two types: guns and howitzers. Guns fired high-velocity shells over a flat trajectory and were often used to deliver fragmentation and to cut barbed wire. Howitzers lofted the shell over a high trajectory so it plunged into the ground. The largest calibers were usually howitzers. The German 420 mm howitzer weighed 20 tons and could fire a one-ton shell over 10 km. A critical feature of period artillery pieces was the recoil mechanism, which meant the gun did not need to be re-aimed after each shot.Initially each gun would need to register its aim on a known target, in view of an observer, in order to fire with precision during a battle. The process of gun registration would often alert the enemy an attack was being planned. Towards the end of 1917, artillery techniques were developed enabling fire to be delivered accurately without registration on the battlefield  the gun registration was done behind the lines then the pre-registered guns were brought up to the front for a surprise attack.GasGas was first used against trenches  unsuccessfully  by British troops against Maori warriors in the Zealand Wars. Early World War I gasses were unreliable, as they could easily be blown back on the troops that deployed them. There were three main types used: gas, chlorine, and phosgene. This prompted the use of gas masks. Early on, improvised gas masks were made by urinating on a handkerchief and putting it over their nose and mouth so the urea would disable the poison.gas was first employed in August 1914 by the French, but this could only disable the enemy. In April 1915, chlorine was first used by Germany at the Battle of Ypres. A large enough dose could kill, but the gas was easy to detect by scent and sight. Those that were not killed on exposure could suffer permanent lung damage. Phosgene, first used in December 1915, was the ultimate killing gas of World War I&mdash;it was 18 times more powerful than chlorine and much more difficult to detect.However, the most effective gas was gas, introduced by Germany in July 1917. Mustard gas was not as fatal as phosgene, but it was hard to detect and lingered on the surface of the battlefield and so could inflict casualties over a long period. The burns it produced were so horrific that a casualty resulting from mustard gas exposure was unlikely to be fit to fight again. Only 2% of mustard gas casualties died, mainly from secondary infections.The first method of employing gas in World War I was by releasing it from a cylinder when the wind was favourable. Such an approach was obviously prone to miscarry if the direction of the wind was misjudged. Also, the cylinders needed to be positioned in the front trenches where they were likely to be ruptured during a bombardment. Later in the war, gas was delivered by artillery or mortar shell.FlamethrowersThe Germans employed Flammenwerfer (flamethrowers) during the war for the first time against the French on 25 June 1915, then against the British 30 July in Hooge. The technology was in its infancy, and use was not very common until the end of 1917 when portability and reliability were improved. It was used in more than 300 documented battles. In 1918, it became a weapon of choice for Stotruppen (Stormtroopers) with a team of six Pionieren (pioneers, engineers) per squad.HelmetsDuring the first year of the First World War, none of the combatant nations equipped their troops with steel helmets. Soldiers went into battle wearing simple cloth or leather caps that offered virtually no protection from the damage caused by modern weapons. German troops were wearing the traditional leather Pickelhaube (spiked helmet), with a covering of cloth to protect the leather from the splattering of mud.Once the war entered the static phase of trench warfare, the number of lethal head wounds that troops were receiving from fragmentation increased dramatically. The French were the first to see a need for greater protection and began to introduce steel helmets in the summer of 1915. The helmet replaced the traditional French kepi and was later adopted by the Belgian, Italian and many other armies.At about the same time the British were developing their own helmets. The French design was rejected as not strong enough and too difficult to mass-produce. The design that was eventually approved by the British was the helmet. This had a wide brim to protect the wearer from falling objects, but offered less protection to the wearers neck. When the Americans entered the war, this was the helmet they chose, though some units used the French Adrian helmet.The traditional German pickelhaube was replaced by the Stahlhelm or steel helmet in 1916. Some elite Italian units used a helmet derived from ancient Roman designs. None of these standard helmets could protect the face or eyes, however. Special face-covers were designed to be used by machine gunners, and the Belgians tried out goggles made of louvres to protect the eyes.WireThe use of wire was decisive in slowing infantry traveling across the battlefield. Slowed down by obstacles, they were much more likely to be hit by concentrated rifle and machinegun fire. Hart identified barbed wire and the machine gun as the elements that had to be broken to regain a mobile battlefield. Wiring was usually done at night, to avoid casualties in mans land. The picket, invented by the Germans and later adopted by the Allies during the war, was quieter than driving stakes, and thus helped decrease the amount of noise working parties would create. Methods to defeat it were rudimentary. British and Commonwealth forces relied on wire cutters, which proved unable to cope with the heavier gauge German wire.( The torpedo was adopted by many armies, and continued in use past the end of World War II.(Bangalore torpedo, in Fitzsimons, Bernard, editor, Encyclopedia of 20h Century Weapons and Warfare (London: Phoebus Publishing Company 1977), Volume 3, p.269.)AircraftThe fundamental purpose of the aircraft in trench warfare was reconnaissance and artillery observation. reconnaissance was so significant in exposing movements, it has been said the trench stalemate was a product of it.(Aces: A Story of the First World War, written by George Pearson, historical advisors Brereton Greenhous & Philip Markham, Film Board of Canada, 1993.) The role of the fighter was to protect friendly aircraft and destroy those of the enemy, or at least deny them the freedom of friendly airspace. This involved achieving superiority over the battlefield by destroying the enemys fighters as well.Spotter aircraft would monitor the fall of shells during registration of the artillery. Reconnaissance aircraft would map trench lines, first with hand-drawn diagrams, later with photography, monitor enemy troop movements, and locate enemy batteries so that they could be destroyed with counter-battery fire.New weaponsImage:France1918.jpg|thumb|right|German soldier with 18, 1918.In 1917 and 1918, new types of weapons were fielded. They changed the face of warfare tactics and were later employed during World War II.The French introduced the CSRG 1915 Chauchat during Spring 1916 around the concept of walking fire, employed in 1918 when 250,000 weapons were fielded. More than 80,000 of the best shooters received the semi-automatic RSC 1917 rifle, allowing them to rapid fire at waves of attacking soldiers. Firing ports were installed in the newly arrived FT 1917 tanks.The French Army fielded a ground version of the Hotchkiss Canon de 37 mm used by the French Navy. It was primarily used to destroy German machine gun nests and concrete reinforced pillboxes with high explosive rounds, but an armour piercing round was designed to defeat the German tanks, making it the first tank gun.A new type of machine gun was introduced in 1916. Initially an aircraft weapon, the Bergmann LMG 15 was modified for ground use, with the later dedicated ground version being the LMG 15 n. A.  It was used as an infantry weapon on all European and Middle Eastern fronts until the end of World War I. It later inspired the 30 and the 34 as well as the concept of the purpose machine gun.What became known as the gun had its genesis in World War I, developed around the concepts of infiltration and fire and movement, specifically to clear trenches of enemy soldiers when engagements were unlikely to occur beyond a range of a few feet. The 18 was the first practical submachine gun used in combat. It was fielded in 1918 by the Army as the primary weapon of the stormtroopers, assault groups that specialized in trench combat.Miningthumb|right|250px|Explosion of a mine seen from a French position. 1916The dry chalk of the Somme was especially suited to mining, but with the aid of pumps, it was also possible to mine in the sodden clay of Flanders. Specialist tunneling companies, usually made up of men who had been miners in civilian life, would dig tunnels under no mans land and beneath the enemys trenches. These mines would then be packed with explosives and detonated, producing a large crater. The crater served two purposes: it could destroy or breach the enemys trench and, by virtue of the raised lip that they produced, could provide a ready-made trench closer to the enemys line. When a mine was detonated, both sides would race to occupy and fortify the crater.If the miners detected an enemy tunnel in progress, they would often drive a counter-tunnel, called a counter-mine or camouflet, which would be detonated in an attempt to destroy the other tunnel prematurely. Night raids were also conducted with the sole purpose of destroying the enemys mine workings. On occasion, mines would cross and fighting would occur underground. The mining skills could also be used to move troops unseen. On one occasion a whole British division was moved through interconnected workings and sewers without German observation. The British detonated a number of mines on July 1, 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme. The largest mines&mdash;the Sap Mine and the Mine&mdash;each containing 24 tons of explosives, were blown near Boiselle, throwing earth 4,000 feet into the air.At 3.10 AM on June 7, 1917, 19 mines were detonated by the British to launch the of Messines. The average mine contained 21 tons of explosive and the largest, 125 feet beneath Saint-Eloi, was twice the average at 42 tons. The combined force of the explosions was supposedly felt in England. As remarked by General Plumer to his staff the evening before the attack::Gentlemen, we may not make history tomorrow, but we shall certainly change the geography.()The craters from these and many other mines on the Western Front are still visible today. Three further mines were laid for Messines but were not detonated as the tactical situation had since changed. One blew during a thunderstorm in 1955; the other two remain to this day.Trench battlesFile:Vimy Memorial - German trenches, mortar emplacement.jpg|thumb|German trenches in VimyWhile trenches have often been dug as defensive measures, in the pre-firearm era, they were mainly a type of hindrance for an attacker of a fortified location, such as the moat around a castle (this is technically called a ditch). An early example of this can be seen in the of the Trench.Only with the advent of accurate firearms, did the use of trenches as positions for the defender of a fortification become common. Elaborate trench and bunker systems were employed by the Mori to withstand British artillery barrages, poison-gas shells and bayonet charges during the Zealand Wars in the 1840s. Trench systems were also employed in the War( and American Civil War. The military usage evolved very quickly in the First World War, until whole systems of extensive main trenches, backup trenches (in case the first lines were overrun) and communication trenches had been developed, often stretching dozens of kilometres along a front without interruption, and some kilometres further back from the opponents lines.StrategyThe fundamental strategy of trench warfare in World War I was to defend ones own position strongly while trying to achieve a breakthrough into the enemys rear. The effect was to end up in attrition; the process of progressively grinding down the oppositions resources until, ultimately, they are no longer able to wage war. This did not prevent the ambitious commander from pursuing the strategy of annihilation&mdash;the ideal of an offensive battle which produces victory in one decisive engagement.The Commander in Chief of the British forces during most of World War I, General Douglas Haig, was constantly seeking a breakthrough which could then be exploited with cavalry divisions. His major trench offensives&mdash;the Somme in 1916 and Flanders in 1917&mdash;were conceived as breakthrough battles but both degenerated into costly attrition. The Germans actively pursued a strategy of attrition in the of Verdun, the sole purpose of which was to bleed the French Army white. At the same time the Allies needed to mount offensives in order to draw attention away from other hard-pressed areas of the line.World War I tacticsImage:Periscope tranche franaise.jpg|right|thumb|250px|French troopers using periscope, 1915The popular image of a trench assault is of a wave of soldiers, bayonets fixed, going over the top and marching in a line across no mans land into a hail of enemy fire. This was the standard method early in the war and successful examples are few. The more common tactic was to attack at night from an advanced post in no mans land, having cut the barbed wire beforehand. In 1917, the Germans innovated with tactics where small groups of highly trained and well-equipped troops would attack vulnerable points and bypass strong points, driving deep into the rear areas. The distance they could advance was still limited by their ability to supply and communicate.The role of artillery in an infantry attack was twofold. The first aim of a bombardment was to prepare the ground for an infantry assault killing or demoralising the enemy garrison and destroying his defences. The duration of these initial bombardments varied, from seconds to days. The problem with artillery bombardments prior to infantry assaults was that they were often ineffective at destroying enemy defences and only served to provide the enemy with advance notice that an attack was imminent. The British bombardment that began the of the Somme lasted eight days but did little damage to either the German barbed wire or their deep dug-outs where the defenders were able to wait out the bombardment in relative safety.Once the guns stopped, the defenders had time to emerge and were usually ready for the attacking infantry. The second aim was to protect the attacking infantry by providing an impenetrable barrage or curtain of shells to prevent an enemy counter-attack. The first attempt at sophistication was the lifting barrage where the first objective of an attack was intensely bombarded for a period before the entire barrage lifted to fall on a second objective farther back. However, this usually expected too much of the infantry, and the usual outcome was that the barrage would outpace the attackers, leaving them without protection.This resulted in the use of the creeping barrage which would lift more frequently but in smaller steps, sweeping the ground ahead and moving so slowly that the attackers could usually follow closely behind it. This became the standard method of attack from late 1916 onward. The main benefit of the barrage was suppression of the enemy rather than to cause casualties or material damage.Capturing the objective was half the battle, but the battle was only won if the objective was held. The attacking force would have to advance with not only the weapons required to capture a trench but also the tools&mdash;sandbags, picks and shovels, barbed wire&mdash;to fortify and defend from counter-attack. The Germans placed great emphasis on immediately counter-attacking to regain lost ground. This strategy cost them dearly in 1917 when the British started to limit their advances so as to be able to meet the anticipated counter-attack from a position of strength. Part of the British artillery was positioned close behind the original start line and took no part in the initial bombardment, being saved to support the advancing troops as they moved beyond the range of guns further back.World War I communicationsA major difficulty faced by an attacking force in a trench battle was unreliable communications. Wireless communications were still in their infancy, so the available methods were telephone, telegraph, semaphore, signal lamps, signal flares, pigeons and runners. Messages frequently could not get through, or if they did, were out of date. A delay would pass when transferring news to the division, corps and army headquarters.Consequently, the outcome of many trench battles was decided by the company and platoon commanders in the thick of the fighting. Senior commanders could not influence the battle for lack of information and inability to get orders to the troops. Opportunities were frequently lost because reinforcements could not be committed at the right time or place, and supporting artillery could not react to a changing situation.World War I  Breaking the deadlockThroughout World War I, the major combatants slowly groped their way towards the tactics necessary for breaking the deadlock of trench warfare, beginning with the French and Germans, with the British Empire forces also contributing to the collective learning experience. The Germans were able to reinforce their western front with additional troops from the east once Russia dropped out of the war in 1917. This allowed them to take units out of the line and train them in new methods and tactics, such as stormtroopers.The new methods involved men rushing forward in small groups using whatever cover was available and laying down covering fire for other groups in the same unit as they moved forward. The new tactics, intended to achieve surprise by disrupting entrenched enemy positions, were to bypass strongpoints and attack the weakest parts of an enemys line. Additionally, they acknowledged the futility of managing a grand detailed plan of operations from afar, opting instead for junior officers on the spot to exercise initiative. These infiltration tactics proved very successful during the German 1918 Spring Offensive against Allied forces.tank crossing a trench.jpg|thumb|right|British Mark IV Female tank crossing a trench (training in England, 1917)Conceived to provide protection from fire, tanks added mobility as well. As the Allied forces perfected them, they broke the deadlock. While not effectively employed at first, tanks had tremendous effects on the morale of German troops in the closing stages of the war on the Western front. The average infantryman had no anti-tank capability, and there were no specialized anti-tank guns. Once tanks began to be used in concentrations, they easily broke through German lines and could not be dislodged through infantry counterattack.During the last 100 days of World War I, the British forces broke through the German trench system and harried the Germans back using infantry supported by tanks and close air support. Between the two world wars these techniques were used by Fuller and Liddell Hart to develop theories about a new type of warfare. The ideas were picked up by the Germans, who developed them further and put them into practice as blitzkrieg.World War IIThe stunning victories by the Germans early in World War II showed that fixed fortifications like the Line were worthless if there was room to circumvent them. At the of Sevastopol, Army forces successfully held trench systems on the narrow peninsula for several months against intense German bombardment. The Western Allies in 1944 broke through the incomplete Wall with relative ease through a combination of amphibious landings, naval gunfire, air attack, and airborne landings. Combined arms tactics where infantry, artillery, armour and aircraft cooperate closely made trench warfare next to obsolete.This is not to say entrenchment is redundant. It is still a valuable method for reinforcing natural obstacles to create a line of defence. For example, at the of Stalingrad, soldiers on both sides dug trenches within the ruins. In addition, before the start of the of Kursk, the Soviets constructed a system of defence more elaborate than any other they built during World War II. These defences succeeded in stopping the German armoured pincers from meeting and enveloping the salient.(Remson, Andrew and Anderson, Debbie. World War II Battle of Kursk: Mine/Countermine operations 25 April 2000, (Prepared for U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command, Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate) Section The Soviet defense system and minefields)The Italian Campaign fought from 1943 until the end of the war in Europe largely consisted of the Allies storming strongly fortified German lines which stretched from one coast, over the mountains to the other coast. When the Allies broke through one line, the Germans would retreat up the peninsular to yet another freshly prepared fortified line.At the start of the of Berlin, the last major assault in the European Theater of Operations during World War II, the Russians attacked over the river Oder against German troops dug in on the Heights, about 50 km (30 mi) east of Berlin. Entrenchment allowed the Germans, who were massively outnumbered, to survive a bombardment from the largest concentration of artillery in history; as the Red Army attempted to cross the marshy riverside terrain, they lost tens of thousands of casualties to the entrenched Germans before breaking through.In the Pacific Theater, during World War II, the Japanese used a labyrinth of underground fixed positions to slow down the Allied advances on many Pacific Islands. The Japanese built fixed fortifications on Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and Guadalcanal using a system of underground tunnels to interconnect their fortified positions. The Japanese had on of Iwo Jima several levels of honeycombed fortifications. The Japanese caused the American advance to slow down and caused massive casualties with these underground fixed positions. The Americans had to use flamethrowers to clear them out.Post-1945 trench warfareImage:101st Airborne Division - Vietnam 01.jpg|right|thumb|Men of the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, fire from old Viet Cong trenches.Trench warfare has been infrequent since the end of World War I. When two large armoured armies meet, the result has generally been mobile warfare of the type which developed in World War II. However, trench warfare reemerged in the latter stages of the Civil War (Campaign), the War, and in some locations and engagements during the War. During the Cold War, NATO forces routinely trained to fight through extensive works called Soviet-style trench systems, named after the Pacts complex systems of field fortifications, an extension of Soviet field entrenching practices for which they were famous in their Patriotic War.Another example of trench warfare after World War I was the War, in which both armies had a large number of infantry with modern small arms, but very little armour, aircraft, or training in combined operations. Tactics used included trench warfare, machine gun posts, bayonet charges, use of barbed wire across trenches and on land, wave attacks and Iraqs extensive use of chemical weapons such as gas against Iranian troops and civilians as well as Iraqi Kurds. The war lasted eight years.Although mainly a siege, it was not unusual to find an extensive trench system inside and outside the city of Sarajevo during the siege of 1992&ndash;1996. It was used mainly for transportation to the frontline or to avoid snipers inside the city. Any pre-existing structures were used as trenches, the best known example is the bobsleigh course on Trebevi, which was used by both Serb and Bosniak during the siege. Another example of trench stalemate was the War of 1998&ndash;2000. The front line in Korea and the front lines between Pakistan and India in Kashmir are two examples of demarcation lines which could become hot at any time. They consist of kilometers of trenches linking fortified strongpoints and in Korea surrounded by millions of mines.See also*(fortification)NotesReferences* Bidwell, Shelford, and Graham, Dominick, Fire-power  The British Army Weapons and Theory of War 1904&ndash;1945, Pen & Sword Books, 2004* Ellis, John, Eye-Deep in Hell  Life in the Trenches 1914&ndash;1918, Fontana, 1977* * * Keegan, John.

Guangxi
orderst Guangxi, formerly romanized Kwangsi, is a province of southern China along its border with Vietnam. In 1958, it became the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of the Republic of China, a region with special privileges created specifically for the people.Guangxis location, in mountainous terrain in the far south of China, has placed it on the frontier of Chinese civilization throughout much of Chinas history. The current name Guang means expanse and has been associated with the region since the creation of Guang Prefecture in AD 226. It was given provincial level status during the Dynasty, but even into the 20th century it was considered an open, wild territory.The abbreviation of the province is  (Pinyin: Gui; Zhuang: Gvei), which comes from the city of Guilin, the former capital, center of much of Guangxis culture, politics, and history, and currently a major city in the autonomous region. History Originally inhabited by a mixture of tribal groups known to the Chinese as the Hundred Yue (Baiyue), the region first became part of China during the Dynasty. In 214 BC, the Han general Tuo (Vietnamese: Triu ) claimed most of southern China for Shihuang before the emperors death and the ensuing civil war permitted Zhao to establishment a separate kingdom at Panyu known as Southern Yue (Nanyue). Alternatively submissive to and independent of Han control, Southern Yue expanded colonization and Sinification under its policy of Harmonizing and Gathering the Hundred Yue () until its collapse in 111 BC.The name Guangxi can be traced to the Expansive or Wide province () of the Wu, who controlled southeastern China during the Kingdoms period. Guilin formed one of its commanderies.Under the Tang, the Zhuang moved to support Piluoges kingdom of Southern Zhao (Nanzhao) in Yunnan which successfully repulsed imperial armies in 751 and 754. Guangxi was then divided into an area of Zhuang ascendancy west of Nanning and an area of Han ascendancy east of Nanning.After the collapse of the Southern Zhao, Yan established the Southern Han (Nanhan) in Xingwangfu (modern Guangdong). Although this state gained minimal control over Guangxi, it was plagued by instability and annexed by the Dynasty in 971. The name Guangxi itself can be traced to the Song, who administered the area as the Guangnanxi (West Southern Expanse) Circuit. Harrassed by both Song and the Jiaozhi in modern Vietnam, the Zhuang leader Zhigao led a revolt in 1052 for which he is still remembered by the Zhuang people. His independent kingdom was short-lived, however, and the tattooed Song general Qing returned Guangxi to China.The Mongolian Dynasty established control over Yunnan during its conquest of Dali in 1253 and eliminated the Song following the of Yamen in 1279. Rather than ruling Lingnan as a subject territory or military district, the Mongolians then established Guangxi (Western Expanse) as a proper province. The area nonetheless continued to be unruly, leading the Dynasty to employ the different local groups against one another. At the of Big Rattan Gorge between the Zhuang and the Yao in 1465, 20,000 deaths were reported.The Manchurian Dynasty left the region alone until the imposition of direct rule in 1726, but the 19th century was one of constant unrest. A Yao revolt in 1831 was followed by the Rebellion in 1850 and the Uprising on 11 January 1851. The execution of St. Chapdelaine by local officials in Guangxi provoked the Opium War in 1858 and the legalization of foreign interference in the interior. Although de lIsle was unable to invade its depot at Longzhou, the Army saw a great deal of action in the 1884 War. Largely ineffective within Vietnam, it was still able to repulse the French from China itself at the of Zhennan Pass (modern Pass) on 23 March 1885.Following the Uprising, Guangxi seceded from the Qing Empire on 6 November 1911. The Qing governor, Bingdan, initially remained in place, but was subsequently removed by a mutiny commanded by General Rongting. General Lus Guangxi Clique overran Hunan and Guangdong as well and helped lead the resistance to Shikais attempt to reestablish an imperial government. Zhuang loyalty made his Army cohesive but reluctant to move far beyond its own provinces. Subsequent feuding with Yat-sen led to defeat in the 1920 and 1921 Wars. After a brief occupation by Jiongmings Cantonese forces, Guangxi fell into disunity and profound banditry for several years(Bonavia, David. Chinas Warlords. New York: Oxford University Press. 1995. ISBN 0-19-586179-5.) until Zongrens Pacification Army established the Guangxi Clique dominated by Li, Shaohong, and Chongxi.Successful action in Hunan against Peifu led to the Zhuang GPA becoming known as the Flying Army and the Army of Steel. After the death of Sun Yat-sen, Li also repulsed Jiyaos revolt and joined the Expedition establishing Republican control over other warlords. His was one of the few Nationalist units free from serious Communist influence and was therefore employed by Kai-shek for the Massacre of 1927. Within Communist China, Guangxi is also noted for the Uprising, a failed Communist revolt led by Zhaoli and Xiaoping in 1929.After his own falling out with Chiang, Li joined Xishans revolt in the Plains War. His defeat did not remove him from control of Guangxi and the Incident and Japanese invasion kept Chiang and the Communists from removing his influence until 1949. The 1944 Ichi-Go successfully expanded Japanese control along the rail lines through Guangxi into Indochina, although the line remained harassed by American bombers and Zhuang guerrillas under Bai Chongxi.Being in the far south, Guangxi did not fall during the Civil War, but joined the Peoples Republic in December 1949, two months after its founding. In 1958, Guangxi was converted into an autonomous region for the Zhuang at the recommendation of Premier Enlai. This decision was made because the Zhuang were the biggest minority group in China and were mostly concentrated in the province.For most of its history, Guangxi was landlocked. In 1952, a small section of Guangdongs coastline was given to Guangxi, giving it access to the sea. This was reversed in 1955, then restored in 1965. During Mao Zedongs Revolution, Guangxi was the site of thousands of incidences of cannibalism.(Kristof, Nicholas D. A Tale of Red Guards and Cannibals. 6 January 1993.)(Zheng Yi. Scarlet Memorial: Tales of Cannibalism in Modern China. (Chinese name: , Gungxi Chrn Kungcho Zhnxin) Westview Press (1998).)While some development of industry occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, the province remained largely a scenic tourist destination. Even the economic growth of the 1990s seemed to leave Guangxi behind. However, in recent years, there has been a growing amount of industrialization and increasing concentration on cash crops. Per capita GDP has begun rising more rapidly, as industries in Guangdong seek a way to locate production to lower-wage areas. Geography Located in the southern part of the country, Guangxi is bordered by Yunnan to the west, Guizhou to the north, Hunan to the northeast, and Guangdong to the east and southeast. It is also bounded by Vietnam in the southwest and the of Tonkin in the south.Guangxi is a mountainous region. The Mountains form the northeast border, with the Yuecheng and Mountains branching from them. Also in the north are the Duyao and Mountains. Near the center of the region are the Da Yao and Da Ming Mountains. On the southeastern border are the Mountains.The highest point is Maoer in the Yuecheng, at .Many rivers cut valleys through the mountains. Most of these rivers form the tributary basin of the West River:Guangxi has a short coastline on the of Tonkin. Important seaports include Beihai, Qinzhou and Fangchenggang.Along the border with Vietnam there is the Detian waterfall (, D Tin Pb), which separates the two countries.Guangxi has a subtropical climate. Summers are generally long and hot. Average annual temperature is 17 to 23C, while average annual precipitation is 1250 to 1750 mm.Major cities include: Nanning, Liuzhou, Guilin, Beihai.Notable towns include: Longmen, Sanjiang, Yangshuo.Image galleryImage:.jpg|River, GuangxiImage:Paddy field Longsheng.JPG|Rice TerraceImage:Yulong.JPG|RiverImage:Thc Bn Gic.jpg| Ban Gioc Falls Administrative divisions Guangxi is divided into fourteen cities, fifty-six counties, thirty-four districts, twelve ethnic autonomous counties and seven county-level cities.

There are a total of 1182 Taiwan ventures in Guangxi, and by the end of 2006, they have brought a total of US$4.27 billion of investment into the autonomous region. During the first half of 2007, 43 projects worthy of RMB2.6 billion (US$342 million) have already been contracted between Guangxi and Taiwan investors. Cooperation between Guangxi and Taiwan companies mainly relates to manufacturing, high-tech electronic industries, agriculture, energy resources and tourism. Power Guangxi Power Grid invested 180 million yuan in 2007 in projects to bring power to areas that still lacked access to electricity. The areas affected include Nanning, Hechi, Bose and Guigang. Around 125,000 people have gained access to electricity. The money has been used to build or alter 738 10-kilovolt distribution units with a total length of wire reaching 1,831.8 kilometers.Due to lack of investment in construction in the grid net in rural areas, more than 400 villages in Guangxi Province were not included in the projects. Around 500,000 cannot participate in the policy known as The Same Grid, the Same Price. Guangxi Power Grid will invest 4.6 billion yuan in improving the power grid during the 11th Five Year Plan.Guangxi Power Grid has invested 2.5 billion yuan in building electric power system in the first half of 2007. Of the total investment, 2.3 billion yuan has been put into the project of the main power grid. So far, four new transformer substations in Guangxi are in various stages of completion. Wenfu substation went into operation in the city of Hechi on January 2007, and since then it has become a major hub of the electrical power system of the surrounding three counties. When Cangwu substation was completed, it doubled the local transformer capacity. In June 2007, the new substation in Chongzuo passed its operation tests. And in the same month, Qiulong commenced production too. This shall support the power supply system of Qiulong City, as well as the northern part of Guangxi province, and facilitate the nationwide project to transmit power from west to east.Beibu Gulf Economic ZoneIn late February 2008, the central government approved Chinas first international and regional economic cooperation zone in Guangxi. The construction of the Gulf Economic Zone began in 2006. With the approval, the Beibu Gulf Economic Zone will be formally incorporated into national development strategies.The Beibu Gulf Economic Zone covers six coastal cities along the Gulf. It integrates the cities of Nanning, the regions capital, Beihai, Qinzhou, Fangchenggang, Chongzuo and Yulin. The state will adopt policies and measures to support mechanism innovation, rational industry layout and infrastructure construction in the Beibu Gulf Economic Zone.Guangxi municipality has pledged a 100 billion yuan (US$ 14 billion) investment over the next five years for building and repairing 2,500 km railways to form a network hub in the area. Beibu Gulf Zone will serve as the logistics base, business base, processing and manufacturing base and information exchange center for China-ASEAN cooperation. Beibu Gulf Zone promises broad prospects for further development and its growth potential is rapidly released. But the shortage of talent and professionals in petrochemicals, iron and steel, electricity, finance, tourism, planning, logistics and marine industries are bottlenecks.The regional government is also working on speeding up key cooperation projects including transportation, the marine industry, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy development, cross-border tourism, and environmental protection. Beibu Gulf has already attracted a number of major projects such as Qinzhou refinery projects and Enso, a 500 forest products company based in Finland. In January 2008 trade import and export in the Beibu Gulf zone exceeded US$1.3 billion, a record high. Bauxite reserves In September 2007, Chinas Ministry of Commerce said that it has found 120 million tons of new bauxite reserves in Guangxi. The ministry said that the new reserves, which are located in Chongzhou in the southern region of Youjiang, have a very high-quality of bauxite, a raw material for making aluminum. Currently, the proven reserves of bauxite in Guangxi are about 1 billion tons, making the province one of the countrys biggest bauxite sources. Demographics File:Ethnic Zhuang Costumes Guangnan Yunnan China.jpg|thumb|peopleThe Chinese are the largest ethnic group. Of these, the main subgroups are those that speak the Mandarin and Cantonese varieties of Chinese.The region has over 14 million Zhuang, the largest minority ethnicity of China. Over 90% of Zhuang in China live in Guangxi, especially in the central and western regions. There is also a significant number of both Dong and Miao minority peoples. Other ethnic groups include: Yao, Hui, Yi (Lolo), Shui, and Gin (Vietnamese). There is a minor Christian population, which is subject to rigorous official regulations.(According to Johnstone, Patrick; Schirrmacher, Thomas (2003). Gebet fr die Welt. Hnssler, p. 255 ISBN 978-0813342757.) Culture Guangxi and neighbouring Guangdong literally mean Western and Eastern Expanse. Together, Guangdong and Guangxi are called the Two Expanses (, Linggung; , Loeng Gwong). Its culture and language are reflected in this. Though now associated with the Zhuang ethnic minority, Guangxis culture traditionally has had a close connection with the Cantonese. Cantonese culture and language followed the Xi River valley from Guangdong and is still predominate in the eastern half of Guangxi today. Outside of this area there is a huge variety of ethnicities and language groups represented.Guangxi is known for its ethno-linguistic diversity. In the capital of Nanning, for example, four dialect-languages are spoken locally: Mandarin, Cantonese, Pinghua, and Zhuang.

Boyac_Department
 footnotes                Boyac () is one of the 32 Departments of Colombia, and the remnant of one of the original nine states of the States of Colombia.Boyac is centrally located within Colombia, almost entirely within the mountains of the Eastern Cordillera to the border with Venezuela, although the western end of the department extends to the River at the town of Puerto Boyac. Boyac borders to the north with the Department of Santander, to the northeast with the Republic of Venezuela and the de Santander Department, to the east with the Departments of Arauca and Casanare. to the South, Boyac borders with the Department of Cundinamarca and to the west with the Department of Antioquia covering a total area of 23,102 km (8,880 sq mi). The capital of Boyac is the city of Tunja.Boyac is known as The Land of Freedom because this region was the scene of a series of battles which led to Colombias independence from Spain. The first one took place on July 25, 1819 in the Pantano de Vargas and the final and decisive battle known as the of Boyac was fought on August 7, 1819 at Puente de Boyac.Boyac is home to three universities: the Pedaggica y Tecnolgica de Colombia (UPTC), the de Boyac (UNIBOYACA), and the Santo Toms.Origin of the nameThe word Boyac derived from the chibchan word Bojaca which means near the Cacique or Region of the Royal MantleHistoryImage:Pisba.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Pass of El Libertador Bolivar over the Tableland.The territory of present day Boyaca was during the Pre-Columbian time a domain of the Muiscas indigenous peoples. The Muiscas under the chiefdom of Zaque of Hunza lived mainly by agriculture and mining. The first European to discover the area was the Spaniard Jimnez de Quesada who conquered and distributed the land in encomiendas and forced the indigenous people to work for him. In 1539, Surez Rendn, a Spanish colonist, founded the village of Tunja and other sites where the indigenous people previously had their villages. The village of Tunja became one of the main political and economic centers for the Spanish during the of New Granada. During the 19th Century Boyaca was battleground for numerous confrontations between the royalist and patriot armies led by Bolvar during the Spanish colonies war of independence from Spain. Two of the most decisive battles were the of Boyac  and the Swamp Battle (1819) won by the patriot forces against the royalists.After the creation of the Confederation by 1858 the territory of now Boyaca became the State of Boyac. It was later rearranged in territory and administration and renamed as Department of Boyaca after a series of wars like the Civil War (1860-1862) and the Days War that struggled over a centralist or federalist system and political instability that changed to many constitutions (such as the Constitution of 1886), Boyaca finally acquired its current definition as territory.Geographythumb|right|250px|Pramo of Rabanal, Boyac.de Tota.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Satellite view of Lake Tota.

Northern_Epirus
:Note: For the autonomous state formed in the region at 1914, see: Republic of Northern Epirus.Northern Epirus (, Vorios Ipiros, ) is a term used to refer to those parts of the historical region of Epirus, in the western Balkans, that are part of the modern Albania. The term is used mostly by Greeks and is associated with the existence of a substantial ethnic Greek population in the region. It also has connotations with political claims on the territory on the grounds that it was held by Greece and in 1914 was declared an independent state() by the local Greeks against annexation to the newly founded Albanian principality.() The term is typically rejected by most Albanians for its irredentist associations. The term Northern Epirus started to be used by Greeks in 1913, upon the creation of the Albanian State following the Wars, and the incorporation into the latter of territory that was regarded by many Greeks as geographically, historically, culturally, and ethnologically connected to the Greek region of Epirus since antiquity.() In the spring of 1914, the Republic of Northern Epirus was proclaimed by ethnic Greeks in the territory and recognized by the Albanian government, though it proved short-lived as Albania collapsed with the onset of War I. Greece held the area between 1914 and 1916, and unsuccessfully tried to annex it in March 1916,( however in 1917 it was driven from the area by Italy, who took over most of Albania.() The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 awarded the area to Greece, however the area reverted to Albanian control in November 1921, following Greeces defeat in the Greco-Turkish War.() During the interwar period, tensions remained high due to the educational issues surrounding the Greek minority in Albania.( Following Italys invasion of Greece from the territory of Albania in 1940 and the successful Greek counterattack, the Greek army briefly held Northern Epirus for a six month period until the German invasion of Greece in 1941.Tensions remained high during the War, as the Greek minority was subjected to repressive measures (along with the rest of the countrys population). Although a Greek minority was recognized by the Hoxha regime, this recognition only applied to an official minority zone consisting of 99 villages, leaving out important areas of Greek settlement, such as Himara. People outside the official minority zone received no education in the Greek language, which was prohibited in public. The Hoxha regime also diluted the ethnic demographics of the region by relocating Greeks living there and settling in their stead Albanians from other parts of the country.( Relations began to improve in the 1980s with Greeces abandonment of any territorial claims over Northern Epirus and the lifting of the official state of war between the two countries.( In the post-Cold War era relations have continued to improve though tensions remain over the availability of education in the Greek language outside the official minority zone, property rights, and occasional violent incidents targeting members of the Greek minority.GeographyThe term Epirus is used both in the Albanian and Greek language, but in Albanian refers only to the historical and not modern region. In antiquity, the northern border of the historical region of Epirus (and of the ancient Greek world) was the Gulf of Oricum,(() or alternatively, the mouth of the Aos river, immediately to the north of the Bay of Aulon (modern-day Vlore.(John Wilkes. The Illyrians. Wiley-Blackwell, 1996, p. 92. Appians description of the Illyrian territories records a southern boundary with Chaonia and Thesprotia, where ancient Epirus began south of river Aous (Vjose). (Map)) To the south, classical Epirus ended at the Gulf, while to the east it was separated from Macedonia and Thessaly by the Pindus mountains. The island of Corfu is situated off the coast of Epirus but is not regarded as part of it.Rather than a clearly defined geographical term, Northern Epirus is largely a political and diplomatic term applied to those areas partly populated by ethnic Greeks that were incorporated into the newly-independent Albanian state in 1913.( According to the 20th century definition, Northern Epirus stretches from the mountains north of Himara southward to the Greek border, and from the Ionian coast to Prespa. The region defined as Northern Epirus thus stretches further east than classical Epirus, and includes parts of the historical region Macedonia. Northern Epirus is rugged, characterized by steep limestone ridges that parallel the Ionian coast, with deep valleys between them.(Encyclopedia of the stateless nations: ethnic and national groups around the world. James Minahan. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002. ISBN 0313323844) The main rivers of the area are: Vjos/Aoos (, Aoos) its tributary the Drino (, Drinos), the Osum ( Apsos) and the Devoll ( Eordaikos). Some of the cities and towns of the region are: Himar, Sarand, Delvin, Gjirokastr, Tepelen, Prmet, Leskovik, Ersek, Kor, Bilisht and the once prosperous town of Moscopole.HistoryMythological foundations and ancient settlementsMany of the regions settlements are associated with the Trojan Epic cycle. Elpenor from Ithaca, in charge of Locrians and Abantes from Evia, founded the cities of Orikum and Thronium on the Bay of Aulon. Amantia was believed to have been founded by Abantes from Thronium. Neoptolemos of the dynasty, in charge of Myrmidones, founded a settlement which in classical antiquity would become known as Bylliace (near Apollonia). Aeneas and Helenus were believed to have founded Bouthroton (modern-day Butrint). Moreover, a son of Helenus named Chaon was believed to be the ancestral leader of the Chaonians.(Cambridge Ancient History. Vol. 3: part 3, 2000)Prehistory and Ancient periodThe first arrival of Greek speaking tribes in the region of Epirus may date around 2100 B.C., at the same period they took control of the area of lake Malik. During the Helladic period (1900-1600 B.C.) these tribes took possession of northern Epirus and created two entities.() The earliest recorded inhabitants of the region (c. 7th century BC) were the Chaonians, one of the main Greek tribes of ancient Epirus, and the region was known as Chaonia. During the 7th century B.C. Chaonian rule was dominant over the region and their power stretched from the Ionian coast to the region of Kor in the east. Important Chaonian settlements in the area included their capital Phoenice, the ports of Onchesmos and Chimaera (modern-day Saranda and Himara, respectively), and the port of Bouthroton (modern-day Butrint. Tumulus II in Kuc i Zi near modern Kor is to date to that age (ca. 650 B.C.) and it is claimed that it belonged to Chaonian nobles.( The strength of the Chaonians prevented other Greeks from establishing colonies on the Chaonian shore, however, several colonies were established in the 8th-6th centuries BC immediately to the north of the mountains, the northern limit of Chaonian territory.(Epeiros, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus) These include Aulon (modern-day Vlor), Apollonia, Epidamnus (modern-day Durres, Oricum, Thronion, and Amantia. In 330 BC, the tribes of Epirus were united into a single kingdom under the Aeacid ruler Alcetas II of the Molossians, and in 232 B.C. the Epirotes established the Epirotic League (), with Phoenice as one of its centers. The unified state of Epirus was a significant power in the Greek world until the Roman conquest in 167 BC.(P. R. Franke, Pyrrhus, in The Cambridge Ancient History VII Part 2: The Rise of Rome to 220 BC: 469, ed. William Walbank. Cambridge University Press, 1984.

Pink - Greek speakers, Blue - Greek and Vlach (Aromanian) speakers, Orange - Greek and Albanian speakers, Yellow - Albanian speakersChristianity first spread in Epirus during the 1st century AD, but did not prevail until the 4th century. The presence of local bishops in the Ecumenical Synods (already from 381 A.D.) proves that the new religion was well organized and already widely spread inside the Greek world of the Roman and post-Roman period.(Bowden 2003)In Roman times, the ancient Greek region of Epirus became the province of vetus (Old Epirus), while a new province Nova (Epirus Nova) was formed out of parts of(Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992,ISBN-0631198075,Page 210) Illyria that had become partly Hellenic(American journal of philology,  98-99,by JSTOR (Organization), Project Muse,1977,page 263, the partly Hellenic and partly Hellenized Epirus Nova) or partly Hellenized.( The line of division between Epirus Nova and the province of Illyricum was the River in modern northern Albania.(Migrations and invasions in Greece and adjacent areas by Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprire Hammond,1976,ISBN-0815550472,page 54,The line of division between Illyricum and the Greek area Epirus nova) This line of division also corresponds with the line, which divides the Balkans into those areas under Hellenic influence in antiquity, and those under Latin influence. When the Roman Empire split into East and West, Epirus became part of the East Roman (Byzantine) Empire; the region witnessed the invasions of several nations: Visigoths, Avars, Slavs, Serbs, Normans, and various city-states and dynasties (14th century). However the regions culture remained closely tied to the centers of the Greek world, and retained its Greek character through the medieval period.In 1204, the region was part of the of Epirus, a successor state of the Byzantine Empire. Despot Michael I found there strong Greek support in order to facilitate his claims for the Empires revival. In 1281, a strong Sicilian force that planned to conquer Constantinople was repelled in Berat after a series of combined operations by local Epirotes and Byzantine troops. In 1345, the region was ruled by the Serbs of Duan. However, the Serbian rulers retained much of the Byzantine tradition and used Byzantine titles to secure the loyalty of the local population. At the same time Venetians controlled various ports of strategic importance, like Vouthroton, but the Ottoman presence became more and more intense until finally in the middle of the 15th century, the entire area came under Turkish rule.Ottoman periodFollowing the Ottoman conquest, local authorities were exclusively Muslim, ethnically either Albanian or Turkish. However, there were specific parts of Epirus that enjoyed local autonomy, such as Himar, Droviani, or Moscopole. In spite of the Ottoman presence, Christianity prevailed in many areas and became an important reason for preserving the Greek language, which was also the language of trade.(Winnifrith 2002) According to the Ottoma Millet system, religion was the main identifier of ethnicity, and thus all Orthodox Christians (including Aromanians and Orthodox Albanians) were classified as Greeks, while all Muslims (including Muslim Albanians) were considered Turks. This view would continue to influence Greek perceptions of the territory for much of the 20th century.(Between the 16th and 19th centuries, inhabitants of the region participated in the Greek Enlightenment. One of the leading figures of that period, the Orthodox missionary of Aetolia, traveled and preached extensively in northern Epirus, founding the Acroceraunian school in Himara in 1770. It is believed that he founded more than 200 Greek schools until his execution by Turkish authorities near Berat.(Stavro Skendi. The Albanian National Awakening, 1878-1912. Princeton University Press, 1967.) In addition, the first printing press in the Balkans, after that of Constantinople, was founded in Moscopole (nicknamed New Athens) by a local Greek.(Greek, Roman and Byzantine studies. Duke University. 1981) From the mid-18th century trade in the region was thriving and a great number of educational facilities and institutions were founded throughout the rural regions and the major urban centers as benefactions by several Epirot entrepreneurs.(Katherine Elizabeth Fleming. The Muslim Bonaparte: diplomacy and orientalism in Ali Pashas Greece. Princeton University Press, 1999. ISBN 9780691001944)During this period a number of uprisings against the Ottoman empire periodically broke out. In the Revolt (1770) several units of Riziotes, Chormovites and Himariotes supported the armed operation. Northern Epirus took also part in the War of Independence (18211830): many locals revolted, organized armed groups and joined the revolution.() The most distinguished personalities were the engineer Lagoumitzis(Surrealism in Greece: An Anthology. Nikos Stabakis. University of Texas Press, 2008. ISBN 0292718004) from Hormovo and Spyromilios from Himar. The latter was one of the most active generals of the revolutionaries and participated in several major armed conflicts, such as the Siege of Missolonghi, where Lagoumitzis was the defenders chief engineer. M. Spyromilios also became a prominent political figure after the creation of the modern Greek state and discreetly supported the revolt of his compatriots in Ottoman-occupied Epirus in 1854, during the War.(The military in Greek politics: from independence to democracy. Thanos Verems. Black Rose Books, 1998 ISBN 1551641054) Another uprising in 1878, in the Saranda-Delvina region, with the revolutionaries demanding union with Greece, was suppressed by the Ottoman forces, while in 1881, the of Berlin awarded to Greece the southernmost parts of Epirus.Balkan Wars (1912-1913)px|Picture of the official declaration of Northern Epirote Independence in Gjirokastr (1 March 1914).With the outbreak of the Balkan War (19121913) and the Ottoman defeat, the Greek army entered the region. The outcome of the following Peace Treaties of London(Clogg 2002: 79. In February 1913, Greek troops captured Ioannina, the capital of Epirus. The Turks recognised the gains of the Balkan allies by the Treaty of London of May 1913.) and of Bucharest,(Clogg 2002: 81. The Second Balkan War was of short duration and the Bulgarians were soon forced to the negotiating table. By the Treaty of Bucharest (August 1913) Bulgaria was obliged to accept a highly unfavorable territorial settlement, although she did retain an Aegean outlet at Dedeagatch (now Alexandroupolis in Greece). Greeces sovereignty over Crete was now recognized but her ambition to annex Northern Epirus, with its substantial Greek population, was thwarted by the incorporation of the region into an independent Albania.) signed at the end of the Balkan War, was unpopular among both Greeks and Albanians, as settlements of the two people existed on both sides of the border: Northern Epirus, already under the control of the Greek army, was awarded to the newly found Albanian State, while the southern part was ceded to Greece.Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus (1914)In accordance with the wishes of the local Greek population, the Republic of Northern Epirus, centered in Gjirokastr on account of the latters large Greek population,() was declared in March 1914 by the pro-Greek party, which was in power in southern Albania at that time.(Stickney 1926) Christakis-Zografos, a distinguished Greek politician from Lunxhri, took the initiative and became the head of the Republic. In May, autonomy was confirmed with the of Corfu, signed by Albanian and Northern Epiroterepresentatives and approved by the Great Powers. The signing of the Protocol ensured that the region would have its own administration, recognized the rights of the local Greeks and provided self government under nominal Albanian sovereignty.(However, the agreement was never fully implemented, because when World War I broke out in July, Albania collapsed. Although short-lived,((Petiffer 2001: In May 1914, the Great Powers signed the Protocol of Corfu, which recognized the area as Greek, after which it was occupied by the Greek army from October 1914 until October 1915.) the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus left behind a substantial historical record, such as its own postage stamps.World War I and following peace treaties (1914-1921)Under an October 1914 agreement among the Allies,() Greek forces re-entered Northern Epirus and the Italians seized the Vlore region.( Greece officially annexed Northern Epirus in March 1916, but was forced to revoke by the Great Powers.( During the war the French Army occupied the area around Kor in 1916, and established the of Kor. In 1917 Greece lost control of the rest of Northern Epirus to Italy, who by then had took over most of Albania.( The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 awarded the area to Greece after World War I, however, political developments such as the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919-22 and, crucially, Italian, Austrian and German lobbying in favor of Albania resulted in the area being ceded to Albania in November 1921.(Interwar period (1921-1939) - Zogs regimeThe Albanian Government, with the countrys entrance to the of Nations (October 1921), made the commitment to respect the social, educational, religious rights of every minority.(Griffith W. Albania and the Sino-Soviet Rift. Cambridge, Massachusetts: 1963: 40, 95.) Questions arose over the size of the Greek minority, with the Albanian government claiming 16,000, and the League of Nations estimating it at 35,000-40,000.( In the event, only a limited area in the Districts of Gjirokastr, Sarand and four villages in Himar region consisting of 15,000 inhabitants(Roudometof, Robertson 2001: 189) was recognized as a Greek minority zone. The following years, measures were taken to suppress(Petiffer 2001: Under King Zog, the Greek villages suffered considerable repression, including the forcible closure of Greek-language schools in 1933-1934 and the ordering of Greek Orthodox monasteries to accept mentally sick individuals as inmates.) the minoritys education. The Albanian state viewed Greek education as a potential threat to its territorial integrity.( Greek schools were either closed or forcibly converted to Albanian schools and teachers were expelled from the country. The 360 schools of the pre-World War I period were reduced dramatically in the following years and education in Greek was finally eliminated altogether in 1935:((George H. Chase. Greece of Tomorrow, ISBN 1406707589: 41.)1926: 78, 1927: 68, 1928: 66, 1929: 60, 1930: 63, 1931: 64, 1932: 43, 1933: 10, 1934: 0With the intervention of the of Nations in 1935, a limited number of schools, and only of those inside the officially recognized zone, were reopened.During this period, the Albanian state led efforts to establish an independent orthodox church (contrary to the Protocol of Corfu), thereby reducing the influence of Greek language in the countrys south. According to a 1923 law, priests who were not Albanian speakers, as well as not of Albanian origin, were excluded from this new autocephalous church.(World War II (1939-1945)In 1939, Albania became an Italian protectorate and was used to facilitate military operations against Greece the following year. The Italian attack, launched at October 28, 1940 was quickly repelled by the Greek forces. The Greek army, although facing a numerically and technologically superior army, counterattacked and in the next month managed to enter Northern Epirus. Northern Epirus thus became the site of the first clear setback for the powers. However, after a six month period of Greek administration, the invasion of Greece by Nazi Germany followed in April 1941 and Greece capitulated.Following Greeces surrender, Northern Epirus again became part of the Italian-occupied Albanian protectorate. Many Northern Epirotes formed resistance groups and organizations in the struggle against the occupation forces. In 1942 the Northern Epirote Liberation Organization (EAOVI, also called MAVI) was formed.(Pyrrhus J. Ruches. Albanias Captives. Argonaut, 1965 (University of California).) Some others joined the left-wing Albanian National Liberation Army, in which they formed a separate battalion (named Thanasis Zikos).(Miranda Vickers & James Petiffer 1997)During October 1943-April 1944, the Albanian collaborationist organization Kombtar with support of Nazi German officers mounted a major offensive in Northern Epirus and fierce fighting occurred between them and the EAOVI. The results were devastating. During this period over 200 Greek populated towns and villages were burned or destroyed, 2,000 Northern Epirotes were killed, 5,000 imprisoned and 2,000 taken hostages to concentration camps. Moreover, 15,000 homes, schools and churches were destroyed. Thirty thousand people had to find refuge in Greece during and after that period, leaving their homeland.(Albania in the Twentieth Century, A History: Volume II: Albania in Occupation and War, 1939-45. Owen Pearson. I.B.Tauris, 2006. ISBN 1845111044.)(Pyrrhus J. Ruches. 1965: 172 The entire carnage , arson and imprisonment suffered by the hands of Balli Kombetar...schools burned.) When the war ended, a States Senate resolution demanded the cession of the region to the Greek state, but according to the following post war international peace treaties it remained part of the Albanian state.()Cold War period (1945-1991) - Hoxhas regimeGeneral violations of human and minority rightsAfter World War II, Albania was governed by a Communist regime led by Hoxha, which suppressed the minority (along with the rest of the population) and took measures to disperse it or at least keep it loyal to Albania.(Clogg 2002: 203 Like all Albanians, the members of the Greek minority had suffered severe repression during the communist era and cross-border family visits had been out of the question. Although basic linguistic, educational and cultural rights were conceded there had been attempts to disperse the minority pressure had been applied on its members to adopt authentically Illyrian names.) Pupils were taught only Albanian history and culture at primary level, the minority zone was reduced from 103 to 99 villages (excluding Himar), many Greeks were forcibly removed from the minority zones to other parts of the country, thereby losing their fundamental minority rights (as a product of communist population policy, an important and constant element of which was to pre-empt ethnic sources of political dissent). Greek place-names were changed to Albanian ones, and Greeks were forced to change their personal names into Albanian names.(Clogg 2002) Archeological sites of the Ancient Greek and Roman era were also presented as Illyrian by the state.(postscript) The use of the Greek language, prohibited everywhere outside the minority zones, was prohibited for many official purposes within them as well.((Petiffer 2001: ...under communism, pupils were taught only Albanian history and culture, even in Greek-language classes at the primary level.)( As a result of these policies, relations with Greece remained extremely tense throughout most of the Cold War.( On the other hand, Enver Hoxha favored a few specific members of the minority, offering them prominent positions within the countrys system, as part of his tokenism policy. However, when the Soviet General Secretary Khrushchev asked about giving more rights to the minority, even autonomy, the answer was negative.(CensorshipStrict censorship was introduced in Socialist Albania as early as 1944,() while the press remained under tight dictatorial control right up until the end of the Bloc (1991).() In 1945, Vima, a propaganda organ of the of Labour of Albania, was the only printed media that was allowed to be published in Greek and was accessible only within District.()Resettlement policyAlthough the Greek minority had some limited rights, during that period a number of Muslim Albanians, that were expelled from Greece after World War II, were given new homes in the area, diluting the local Greek element.(David Shankland. Archaeology, anthropology, and heritage in the Balkans and Anatolia Isis Press, 2004. ISBN 9789754282801, p. 198.) Moreover, during this period a number of new settlements, consisting of Muslim settlers, were created as a buffer zone between the recognized minority zone and regions of unclear ethnic consciousness.(King, Mai, Schwandner-Sievers 2005: 173-194)Isolation and labour campsStalinist Albania, already increasingly paranoid and isolated after de-Stalinization and the death of Tse Tung (1976),() restricted visitors to 6,000 per year, and segregated those few that traveled to Albania.() The country was virtually isolated and common penalties for attempts to escape the country, for ethnic Greeks, were execution for the offenders and exile for their families, usually in mining camps in central and northern Albania.(Miranda Vickers & James Petiffer 1997: 190) The regime maintained twenty-nine prisons and labour camps throughout Albania, that were filled with more than 30,000 enemies of the state year after year. It was unofficially reported that a large percentage of the imprisoned were ethnic Greeks.(Working Paper. Albanian Series. Gender Ethnicity and Landed Property in Albania. Sussana Lastaria-Cornhiel, Rachel Wheeler. September 1998. Land Tenure Center. University of Wisconsin. Hoxhas regime maintained an extensive gulag...40 percent.)Prohibition of religionThe state attempted to suppress any religious practice (both public and private), adherence to which was considered anti-modern and dangerous to the unity of the Albanian state. The process started in 1949,( with the confiscation and nationalization of Orthodox Church property and intensified in 1967 when the authorities conducted a violent campaign to extinguish(Petiffer 2001: ...onset in 1967 of the campaign by Albanias communist party, the Albanian Party of Labour (PLA), to eradicate organised religion, a prime target of which was the Orthodox Church. Many churches were damaged or destroyed during this period, and many Greek-language books were banned because of their religious themes or orientation. Yet, as with other communist states, particularly in the Balkans, where measures putatively geared towards the consolidation of political control intersected with the pursuit of national integration, it is often impossible to distinguish sharply between ideological and ethno-cultural bases of repression. This is all the more true in the case of Albanias anti-religion campaign because it was merely one element in the broader Ideological and Cultural Revolution begun by Hoxha in 1966 but whose main features he outlined at the PLAs Fourth Congress in 1961.) all religious life in Albania, claiming that it had divided the Albanian nation and kept it mired in backwardness. Student agitators combed the countryside, likewise forcing Albanians and Greeks to quit practicing their faith. All churches, mosques, monasteries and other religious institutions were closed or converted into warehouses, gymnasiums, and workshops. Clergy were imprisoned, and owning an icon became an offense that could be prosecuted under Albanian law. The campaign culminated in an announcement that Albania had become the worlds first atheistic state, a feat touted as one of Enver Hoxhas greatest achievements.(Miranda Vickers & James Petiffer 1997: ...with the demolition and the subsequent demolition of many churches, burning of religious books general human rights violations. Christians could not mention Orthodoxy even in their own homes, visit their parents graves, light memorial candles or make the sign of the Cross.) Christians were prohibited from mentioning Orthodoxy even in their own homes, visit their parents graves, light memorial candles or make the sign of the Cross. In this respect, the campaign against religions hit ethnic Greeks disproportionately, since affiliation to the Eastern Orthodox rite has traditionally been a strong component of Greek identity.(Minority Rights Group International, World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples - Albania : Greeks, 2008. Online. UNHCR Refworld):See also: Autocephalous Church of Albania, Religion in communist Albania1980s thawThe first serious attempt to improve relations was initiated by Greece in the 1980s, during the government of Papandreou.( In 1984, during a speech in Epirus, Papandreou declared that the inviolability of European borders as stipulated in the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, to which Greece was a signatory, applied to the Greek-Albanian border.( The most significant change occurred on 28 August 1987, when the Greek Cabinet lifted the state of war that had been declared since November 1940.( At the same time, Papandreou deplored the miserable condition under which the Greeks in Albania live.(Post-communist period (1991-present)Beginning in 1990, large number of Albanian citizens, including members of the Greek minority, began seeking refuge in Greece. This exodus turned into a flood by 1991, creating a new reality in Greek-Albanian relations.( With the fall of communism in 1991, Orthodox churches were reopened and religious practices were permitted after 35 years of strict prohibition. Moreover, Greek-language education was initially expanded. In 1991 ethnic Greeks shops in the town of Saranda were attacked, and inter-ethnic relations throughout Albania worsened.((Petiffer 2001: In 1991, Greek shops were attacked in the coastal town of Saranda, home to a large minority population, and inter-ethnic relations throughout Albania worsened.) Greek-Albanian tensions escalated in November 1993 when seven Greek schools were forcibly closed by the Albanian police.( A purge of ethnic Greeks in the professions in Albania continued in 1994, with particular emphasis in law and the military.(Miranda Vickers & James Petiffer 1997: 198) On 10 April 1994, Albania announced that two of its soldiers had been killed in an attack on a military camp in Peshkepi, close to the Greek border. The attack was claimed by the Northern Epirus Liberation Front (MAVI), which had officially disbanded at the end of World War II.Trial of the Omonoia FiveTensions increased when on 20 May 1994 the Albanian Government took into custody five members of the ethnic Greek advocacy organization Omonoia on the charge of high treason, accusing them of secessionist activities and illegal possession of weapons (a sixth member was added later).(Clogg 2002: 214. This war of words culminated in the arrest by the Albanian authorities in May of six members of the Onomoia, the main Greek minority organization in Albania. At their subsequent trial, five of the six received prison sentences of between six and eight years for treasonable advocacy of the secession of Northern Epirus to Greece and the illegal possession of weapons.) Sentences of six to eight years were handed down. The accusations, the manner in which the trial was conducted and its outcome were strongly criticized by Greece as well as international organizations. Greece responded by freezing all EU aid to Albania, sealing its border with Albania, and between AugustNovember 1994, expellingover 115,000 illegal Albanian immigrants, a figure quoted in the US Department of State Human Rights Report and given to the American authorities by their Greek counterpart.(Greek Helsinki Monitor: Greeks of Albania and Albanians in Greece, September 1994.) Tensions increased even further when the Albanian government drafted a law requiring the head of the Orthodox Church in Albania be born in Albania, which would force the then head of the church, the Greek Anastasios of Albania from his post.( In December 1994, however, Greece began to permit limited EU aid to Albania as a gesture of goodwill, while Albania released two of the Omonoia defendants and reduced the sentences of the remaining four. In 1995, the remaining defendants were released on suspended sentences.(Recent yearsIn recent years relations have significantly improved; Greece and Albania signed a Friendship, Cooperation, Good Neighborliness and Security Agreement on March 21, 1996.( Additionally, Greece is Albanias main foreign investor, having invested more than 400 million dollars in Albania, Albanias second largest trading partner, with Greek products accounting for some 21% of Albanian imports, and 12% of Albanian exports coming to Greece, and Albanias fourth largest donor country, having provided aid amounting to 73.8 million euros.(Greek Ministry for Foreign Affairs: Bilateral relations between Greece and Albania.) Although relations between Albania and Greece have greatly improved in recent years, the Greek minority in Albania continues to suffer discrimination particularly regarding education in the Greek language,( property rights of the minority, and violent incidents against the minority by nationalist extremists. Tensions resurfaced during local government elections in Himara in 2000, when a number of incidents of hostility towards the Greek minority took place, as well as with the defacing of signposts written in Greek in the countrys south by Albanian nationalist elements,(World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous People: Albanian overview: Greeks.) and more recently following the of Aristotelis Goumas. According to diplomatic sources, there has recently been an upsurge in nationalist activity among Albanians targeting the Greek minority, especially following the ruling of the Court of Justice in favor of Kosovos independence.()DemographicsIn Albania, Greeks are considered a national minority. There are no reliable(Petiffer 2001: ...the area studied was confined to the southern border fringes, and there is good reason to believe that this estimate was very low.Under this definition, minority status was limited to those who lived in 99 villages in the southern border areas, thereby excluding important concentrations of Greek settlement in Vlor (perhaps 8000 people in 1994) and in adjoining areas along the coast, ancestral Greek towns such as Himara, and ethnic Greeks living elsewhere throughout the country. Mixed villages outside this designated zone, even those with a clear majority of ethnic Greeks, were not considered minority areas and therefore were denied any Greek-language cultural or educational provisions. In addition, many Greeks were forcibly removed from the minority zones to other parts of the country as a product of communist population policy, an important and constant element of which was to pre-empt ethnic sources of political dissent. Greek place-names were changed to Albanian names, while use of the Greek language, prohibited everywhere outside the minority zones, was prohibited for many official purposes within them as well.) statistics on the size of any ethnic minorities in Albania, as the Albanian government does not include them on the census. The Albanian government is not going to conduct an official census on ethnicity. Some commentators allege that this is out of fear that a considerable part of the population will register themselves as Greek.(Migration and Ethnicity in Albania: Synergies and Interdependencies. Kosta Barjaba. Watson Institute for International Studies. Nonetheless, it appears that the Albanian government is not going to conduct an official census, which would clarify the numbers. The Albanian government fears that if a census were adopted, a considerable part of the population would be registered as Greek.)According to data presented to the 1919 Paris Conference, by the Greek side, the Greek minority numbered 120,000,() and the last census to include data on ethnic minorities conducted in 1989 under the communist regime cites only 58,785 Greeks although the total population of Albania had tripled in the meantime.( More recent estimations by the Albanian government raise the number to 80,000.(Nicholas V. Gianaris. Geopolitical and economic changes in the Balkan countries Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996 ISBN 9780275955410, p. 4)However, the area studied was confined to the southern border, and this estimate is considered to be low. Under this definition, minority status was limited to those who lived in 99 villages in the southern border areas, thereby excluding important concentrations of Greek settlement and making the minority seem smaller than it is.( Sources from the Greek minority have claimed that there are up to 400,000 Greeks in Albania, or 12% of the total population at the time (from the Epirot lobby of Greeks with family roots in Albania).() Most western estimates of the minoritys size put it at around 200,000, or ~6% of the population,() though a large number, possibly two thirds, has migrated to Greece in recent years.(The Nations and Peoples Organization estimates the Greek minority at approximately 70,000 people.() Other independent sources estimate that the number of Greeks in Northern Epirus is 117,000 (about 3.5% of the total population),() a figure close to the estimate provided by The World Factbook (2006) (about 3%). But this number was 8% by the same agency a year before.()(The CIA World Factbook (1993) provided a figure of 8% for the Greek minority in Albania.) A 2003 survey conducted by Greek scholars estimate the size of the Greek minority at around 60.000.() The total population of Northern Epirus is estimated to be around 577,000 (2002), with main ethnic groups being Albanians, Greeks and Vlachs.(James Minahan, Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nation, 2002, pg. 547.

On the other hand minority representatives complain of the governments unwillingness to recognize the possible existence of ethnic Greek towns outside communist-era minority zones; to utilize Greek on official documents and on public signs in ethnic Greek areas; to ascertain the size of the ethnic Greek population; and to include more ethnic Greeks in public administration.(Minority Rights Group International, World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples - Albania: Greeks, 2008. UNHCR Refworld) There have been many minor incidents between the Greek population and Albanian authorities over issues such as the alleged involvement of the Greek government in local politics, the raising of the Greek flag on Albanian territory, and the language taught in state schools of the region; however, these issues have, for the most part, been non-violent.Minority zoneFile:Ethnic composition of Albania, municipality data of 1989 census.gif|thumb|right|120px|Approximate extent of the recognized (after 1945) Greek minority zone in green, according to the 1989 Albanian census. Greek majority areas in green.(Second Report Submitted By Albania Pursuant to Article 25, Paragraph 1, of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.)The Albanian Government continues to use the term minority zones, in violation to human rights issues, to describe the southern districts consisting of 99 towns and villages, which they have recognized majorities of ethnic Greeks. In fact it continues to contend that all those belonging to national minorities are recognised as such, irrespective of the geographical areas in which they live. However, the situation is somewhat different in practice. This results in a situation in which the protection of national minorities is subject to overly rigid geographical restrictions restricting access to minority rights outside these zones. One of the major fields that it has a practical application is that of education.(Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities: Second Opinion on Albania 29 May 2008. Council of Europe: Secretariat of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.)(Albanian Human Rights Pracitces, 1993. Author: U.S. Department of State. January 31, 1994.)Protests against irregularities in 2011 censusThe census of October 2011 will include ethnicity for the first time in post-communist Albania, a long standing demand of the Greek minority and of international organizations.( However, Greek representatives already found this procedure unacceptable due to article 20 of the Census law, which was proposed by the nationalist oriented for Justice, Integration and Unity and accepted by the Albanian government. According to this, there is a $1,000 fine for someone who will declare anything other than what was written down on his birth certificate,() including certificates from the communist-era where minority status was limited to only 99 villages.()() Indeed, Omonoia unanimously decided to boycott the census, since it violates the fundamental right of self determination.()Minoritys representation on local and state politicsThe minoritys sociopolitical organization from promotion of Greek human rights, Omonoia, founded in January 1991, took an active role on minority issues. Omonoia was banned in the parliamentary elections of March 1991, because it violated the Albanian law which forbade formation of parties on a religious, ethnic and regional basis. This situation resulted in a number of strong protests not only from the Greek side, but also from international organizations. Finally, on behalf of Omonoia, the for Human Rights Party contested at the following elections, a party which represents that Greek minority in the Albanian parliament.(Petiffer 2001: Following strong protests by the Conference on Security... this decision was revered.)In more recent years, tensions have surrounded the participation of candidates of the Unity for Human Rights Party in Albanian elections. In 2000, the Albanian municipal elections were criticised by international human rights groups for serious irregularities reported to have been directed against ethnic Greek candidates and parties.(Rights Watch Report on Albania) The most recent municipal elections held in February 2007 saw the participation of a number of ethnic Greek candidates, with Bolanos being re-elected mayor of the southern town of Himar despite the governing and opposition Albanian parties fielding a combined candidate against him. Greek observers have expressed concern at the non-conformity of procedure in the conduct of the elections.()In 2004, there were five ethnic Greek members in the Albanian Parliament, and two ministers in the Albanian cabinet.(Albania: Profile of Asylum claims and country conditions. United States Department of State. March 2004, p. 6.) Politicians from the Greek minority have also become MPs for other parties, as Spiro Ksera and Kosta Barka for DPA; and Anastas Angjeli, Vangjel Tavo for SPA.Land distribution and property in post-communist AlbaniaThe return to Albania of ethnic Greeks that were expelled during the past regime seemed possible after 1991. However, the return of their confiscated properties is even now impossible, due to Albanians inability to compensate the present owners. Moreover, the full return of the Orthodox Church property also seems impossible for the same reasons.()EducationFile:Street Sign Goranxi.jpg|thumb|260px|Bilingual road sign, in Albanian and Greek, near Gjirokastr.Greek education in the region was thriving during the late Ottoman period (18th-19th centuries). When the First World War broke out in 1914, 360 Greek language schools were functioning in Northern Epirus (as well as in Elbasan, Berat, Tirana) with 23,000 students.() During the following decades the majority of Greek schools were closed and Greek education was prohibited in most districts. In the post-communist period (after 1991), the reopening of schools was one of the major objectives of the minority. In April 2005 a bilingual Greek-Albanian school in Korca,() and after many years of efforts, a private Greek school was opened in the Himara municipality in spring of 2006.(Gregori 2008: 68)Official positionsAlbaniaIn Albanian bibliography it is widely claimed that the Greek minority as it currently exists was the result of population movements under the Ottoman empire, and the great majority of the Greeks arrived in modern Albania as indentured labourers in the time of the Ottoman beys denying any link with local ancient Greek presence.(Petiffer 2001: 4-5)In 1994 the Albanian authorities admitted for the first time that Greek minority members exist not only in the designated minority zones but all over Albania.(King, Mai, Schwandner-Sievers 2005: 73)GreeceIn 1991, the Greek Prime Minister Mitsotakis specified that the issue, according the Greek minority in Albania, focuses on 6 major topics that the post-communist Albanian government should deal with(:*The return of the confiscated property of the Orthodox Church and the freedom of religious practice.*Functioning of Greek language schools (both public and private) in all the areas that Greek populations are concentrated.*The Greek minority should be allowed to found cultural, religious, educational and social organizations.*Illegal dismissals of members of the Greek minority from the countrys public sector should be stopped and same rights for admission should be granted (on every level) for every citizen.*The Greek families that left Albania during the communist regime (19451991), should be encouraged to return to Albania and acquire their lost properties.*The Albanian government should take the initiative to conduct a census on ethnological basis and give its citizens the right to choose without limitations their ethnicity.Incidents* In April 1994, Albania announced that unknown individuals attacked a military camp near the Greek-Albanian border (incident), with two soldiers killed. Responsibility for the attack was taken by MAVI (Northern Epirus Liberation Front), which officially ceased to exist since the end of World War II. This incident triggered a serious crisis between Albanian-Greek relations.(* The house of Himaras ethnic Greek mayor, Bollano, has been the target of a bomb attack twice, in 2004 and again in May 2010.(http://www.zougla.gr/page.ashx?pid2&aid138350&cid4)* On August 12, 2010, ethnic tensions soared after ethnic Greek shopkeeper Aristotelis Goumas was killed when his motorcycle was hit by a car driven by three Albanian youths with whom Goumas allegedly had an altercation when they demanded that he not speak Greek to them in his store.()() Outraged locals blocked the main highway between Vlore and Saranda and demanded reform and increased local Himariote representation in the local police force.( The incident was condemned by both the Greek and Albanian governments and three suspects are currently in custody awaiting trial.(GalleryFile:KonZappas.jpg|ZappasFile:Evangelos Zappas.jpg|ZappasFile:GZografos.jpg|Christakis-ZografosFile:MichailSpyromilios.jpg|SpyromiliosFile:Spyros Spyromilios.jpg|SpyromiliosFile:Piros dimas in dion.jpg|DimasFile:Ninis.jpg|NinisFile:Stamp Epirus 1914 1d infantry.jpg|1-drachma value of the infantryman issue of March 1914File:Stamp Epirus 1914 5l flag.jpg|Flag stamp, 5 lepta of 1914File:Stamp Epirus 1916 3l occupation.jpg|Occupation overprint on 3-lepta stamp of Greece of 1916See also* Republic of Northern Epirus* of Corfu* Albanisation* Chameria* (region)* Epirotes* stamps and postal history of Northern Epirus* of Greek countries and regionsReferencesBibliographyHistory* * * ****Current topics**** *Further reading** * External links*Ethnographic map of Albania and neighbors, showing concentration of Greeks in Northern Epirus*UNPO profile of the Greek minority in Albania*Albania: the Greek minority by Rights Watch*Assessment for Greeks in Albania by the Minorities at Risk (MAR) Project*Greeks of Albania and Albanians in Greece by the Helsinki Monitor*Southern Albania, Northern Epirus: Survey of a Disputed Ethnological Boundary by Tom J.

Colony_of_Virginia
The Colony of Virginia (also known frequently as the Virginia Colony, the Province of Virginia, and occasionally as the Dominion and Colony of Virginia) was the English colony in America that existed briefly during the 16th century, and then continuously from 1607 until the Revolution (as a British colony after 1707). The name Virginia was first applied by Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth I in 1584.  After the Civil War in the mid 17th century, the Virginia Colony was nicknamed The Old Dominion by King Charles II for its perceived loyalty to the English monarchy during the era of the of England.After independence from Great Britain in 1776 the Virginia Colony became the of Virginia, one of the original thirteen states of the United States, adopting as its official slogan The Old Dominion. After the United States was formed, the entire states of Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois, and portions of Ohio were all later created from the territory encompassed earlier by the Colony of Virginia.

Area west of this line in present-day Southwest VA was ceded by the Cherokee in 1775.The name Virginia is the oldest designation for English claims in North America.  In 1584 Walter Raleigh sent Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe to explore what is now the Carolina coast, and they returned with word of a regional king (weroance) named Wingina, who ruled a land supposedly called Wingandacoa. The latter word may have inspired the Queen to name the colony Virginia, noting her status as the Virgin Queen.()() On the next voyage, Raleigh was to learn that, while the chief of the Secotans was indeed called Wingina, the expression wingandacoa heard by the English upon arrival actually meant What good clothes you wear! in Algonquian, and was not the name of the country as previously misunderstood.(http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jmack/algonqin/mook1.htm)Initially, the term Virginia was applied to the entire eastern coast of North America from the 34th parallel (near Cape Fear) north to the 48th parallel, including the shorelines of Acadia and a large portion of inland Canada. Although Spain, France, Sweden, and the Netherlands all had competing claims to the region, none of these prevented the English from becoming the first European power to colonize successfully the Mid-Atlantic coastline. Earlier attempts had been made by the Spanish in what is now Georgia (Miguel de Gualdape, 152627; several missions in Georgia between 1568 and 1684), South Carolina (Santa Elena, 156687), North Carolina (Joara, 156768) and Virginia (Mission, 157071); and by French in South Carolina (Charlesfort, 156263).Farther south, the Spanish colony of Florida, centered on St. Augustine, was established in 1565, while to the north, the French were establishing settlements in what is now Canada. Settlements at Roanoke Island In 1584, Sir Raleigh sent his first colonization mission to the island of Roanoke (in present-day Carolina). This was the first English settlement, although it did not survive, it was a military research expedition with a very narrow focus.  Gans was sequestered on Roanoke Island to research copper smelting techniques of the indigenous tribes in order to reduce European smelting times from 16 weeks to 4 days; giving the English a strategic advantage over other European nations in smelting and forging cannons for their warships.(Joachim Gans of Prague: The First Jew in English America, American Jewish History - by Grassl, Gary C., Volume 86, Number 2, June 1998, pp. 195-217)(Colonial Williamsburg: the journal of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, Volumes 22-24, Pg 8, Published by Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, 2000)  What is unique about the inclusion of Joachim Gans in this expedition was that Jews were not allowed in England until Oliver Cromwell allowed them back into England in 1655 by refusing to extend Expulsion Laws imposed roughly 300 years earlier by Edward I in 1290.(Jews and the state: dangerous alliances and the perils of privilege, Volume 19 of Studies in contemporary Jewry, by Ezra Mendelsohn, Pg 7, Oxford University Press US, 2003, ISBN 0195170873, 9780195170870)In 1587, Raleigh sent another group to again attempt to establish a permanent settlement. The first English child born in the World was named Dare. The expedition leader, John White returned to England for supplies that same year, but was unable to return to the colony due to war between England and Spain. When he finally did return in 1590, he found the colony abandoned. The houses were intact, but the colonists had completely disappeared. Although there are a number of theories about the fate of the colony, it remains a mystery and has come to be known as the Lost Colony. Dare County was named in honor of the baby Virginia Dare, who was among those whose fate is unknown. The word Croatoan was found carved into a tree, the name of a tribe on a nearby island.(American Archaeology Uncovers the Earliest English Colonies, by Lois Miner Huey, Page 16, Published by Marshall Cavendish, 2009, ISBN 0761442642, 9780761442646)(Sir Walter Raleighs lost colony: An historical sketch of the attempts of Sir Walter Raleigh to establish a colony in Virginia, with the traditions of an Indian tribe in North Carolina. Indicating the fate of the colony of Englishmen left on Roanoke Island in 1587, Volume 210, Advance Presses 1888, pg 7) Virginia Company: Plymouth and London branches Following the death of Queen I in 1603, King James I ascended to the throne. England was financially pressed following years of war with Spain. Additionally, Englands forests and other natural resources were nearly exhausted after centuries of supporting the population. In order to remedy these vital resources, they were supplemented in part by trade with other nations, as well as exploitation of Northern Ireland labor and resources via Ulster plantation. The Company in particular, had success importing goods such as lumber and pitch from the Dutch.  However, the volatile and unstable conditions of the various trade relationships throughout Europe positioned England to consider other alternatives in the World. Investment capital was raised to bring back gold and other riches and seek the Passage to the Middle East and India.  James granted a  proprietary charter to two competing branches of the Company, which were supported by investors. These were the Company and the Company.By the terms of the charter, the Plymouth Company was permitted to establish a colony of  square between the 38th parallel and the 45th parallel (roughly between Bay and the current U.S.-Canada border). The London Company was permitted to establish between the 34th parallel and the 41st parallel (approximately between Cape Fear and Island Sound), and also owned a large portion of Atlantic and Inland Canada. In the area of overlap, the two companies were not permitted to establish colonies within one hundred miles of each other.  During 1606, each company organized expeditions to establish settlements within the area of their rights.In the plot of the play Hoe, presented on the London stage in 1605, the villains of the piece attempt to flee to Virginia after accumulating debts in England. Popham Colony In August 1606, the first Plymouth Company ship, Richard, sailed for the New World. However, it was intercepted and captured by the Spanish near Florida in November 1606 and never reached Virginia. The next attempt was more successful. About 120 colonists left Plymouth on May 31, 1607 in two ships. Colony leader Popham sailed aboard the of God, while second-in-command Gilbert traveled on the Mary and John, whose captain was Robert Davies. Captain Davies maintained a diary which is one of the modern sources of information about the Popham Colony.Arriving in August 1607, these Plymouth Company colonists established their settlement, known as the Colony, in the present-day town of Maine near the mouth of the River. They intended to trade metals, spices, furs, and show that the local forests could be used to build English ships. Half of the colonists returned to England in the fall of 1607 aboard the Gift of God; the other half stayed through the winter, spring, and summer, during which time they built a 30-ton ship, a pinnace they named Virginia. Late that summer, all the remaining colonists returned to England aboard the Virginia and the Mary and John. The short-lived colony had lasted about a year. Although not permanent, it was the second English colony in the region, after Cuttyhunk in 1602, that would eventually become known as England. The exact site of the Popham Colony had long been lost until its rediscovery in 1994.  Jamestown The London Company hired Captain Newport to lead its expedition. On December 20, 1606, he set sail from England with his flagship, the Constant, and two smaller ships, the Godspeed, and the Discovery, with 105 men and boys, plus 39 sailors.(Prelude to Jamestown) After an unusually long voyage of 144 days, they arrived at the mouth of the Bay, and came ashore at the point where the southern side of the bay meets the Atlantic Ocean,  an event which has come to be called the First Landing.  They erected a cross, and named the point of land Henry, in honor of Frederick, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King James.Their instructions were to select a location inland along a waterway where they would be less vulnerable to the Spanish or other Europeans also seeking to establish colonies. They sailed westward into the Bay and reached the mouth of Roads, stopping at a location now known as Point Comfort. Keeping the shoreline to their right, they then ventured up the largest river, which they named the James, for their king. After exploring at least as far upriver as the confluence of the River at present-day Hopewell, they returned downstream to Island, which offered a favorable defensive position against enemy ships and deep water anchorage adjacent to the land. Within 2 weeks, they had constructed their first fort, and named their settlement Jamestown.In addition to securing gold and other precious minerals to send back to the waiting investors in England, the survival plan for the Jamestown colonists depended upon regular supplies from England and trade with the Native Americans. The location they selected was largely cutoff from the mainland, and offered little game for hunting, no fresh drinking water, and very limited ground for farming. Captain Newport returned to England twice, delivering the First Supply and the Second Supply  missions during 1608, and leaving the Discovery for the use of the colonists. However, death from disease and conflicts with the Natives Americans took a fearsome toll of the colonists. Despite attempts at mining minerals, growing silk, and exporting the native Virginia tobacco, no profitable exports had been identified, and it was unclear whether the settlement would survive financially.In 1609, with the abandonment of the Plymouth Company settlement, the London Companys Virginia charter was adjusted to include the territory north of the 34th parallel and south of the 39th parallel, with its original coastal grant extended from sea to sea.  Thus, at least on paper, the Virginia Colony in its original sense extended to the coast of the Pacific Ocean, in what is now California, with all the states in between (Kentucky, Missouri, Colorado, Utah, etc.) belonging to Virginia.  For practical purposes, though, the original Virginians rarely ventured far inland to what was then known as The Virginia Wilderness, although the concept itself helped renew the interest of investors, and additional funds enabled an expanded effort, known as the Supply.For the Third Supply, the London Company had a new ship built. The Venture was specifically designed for emigration of additional colonists and transporting supplies. It became the flagship of the Admiral of the convoy, Sir Somers. The Third Supply was the largest to date, with 8 other ships joining the Sea Venture. The new Captain of the Sea Venture was missions Vice-Admiral, Christopher Newport. Hundreds of new colonists were aboard the ships. However, weather was to drastically affect the mission. Bermuda: The Somers Isles A few days out of London, the 9 ships of the Third Supply mission encountered a massive hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. They became separated during the three days the storm lasted. Admiral Sir George Somers had the new Sea Venture, carrying most of the supplies of the mission, deliberately driven aground onto the reefs of Bermuda to avoid sinking. However, while there was no loss of life, the ship was wrecked beyond repair, stranding its survivors on the uninhabited archipelago, to which they laid claim for England.The survivors at Bermuda eventually built two smaller ships and most of them continued on to Jamestown, leaving a few on Bermuda to secure the claim.The Companys possession of Bermuda was made official in 1612, when the third and final charter extended the boundaries of Virginia far enough out to sea to encompass Bermuda, which was also known, for a time, as Virgineola.Bermuda has since been known officially also as The Somers Isles (in commemoration of Admiral Somers). The shareholders of the Virginia Company spun off a second company, the Isles Company, which administered Bermuda from 1615 til 1684.However, upon their arrival at Jamestown, the survivors of the Sea Venture  discovered that the 10 month delay had greatly aggravated other adverse conditions. Seven of the other ships had arrived carrying more colonists, but little in the way of food and supplies. Combined with a drought, and hostile relations with the Native Americans, the loss of the supplies which had been aboard the Sea Venture had resulted in the Starving Time in late 1609 to May 1610, during which over 80% of the colonists perished.  The survivors from Bermuda had brought few supplies and food with them, and it appeared to all that Jamestown must be abandoned and it would be necessary to return to England.A timely arrival: Lord De La WarrFile:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles, by Capt. John SmithArgall was the captain of one of the seven ships of the Third Supply which had arrived at Jamestown in 1609 after becoming separated from the Sea Venture, whose fate was unknown. Depositing his passengers and limited supplies, he had returned to England with word of the plight of the colonists at Jamestown. The King had authorized another leader, West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, later better known as Lord Delaware, to have greater powers, and the London Company had organized another Supply mission. They set sail from London on April 1, 1610.Just after the survivors of the Starving Time and those who had joined them from Bermuda had abandoned Jamestown, the ships of the new supply mission sailed up the James River with food, supplies, a doctor, and more colonists. Lord Delaware was determined that the colony was to survive, and intercepted the departing ships about  downstream of Jamestown. The colonists thanked Providence for the Colonys salvation. Among these individuals who had briefly abandoned Jamestown was Rolfe, a Sea Venture survivor who had lost his wife and son in Bermuda. He was a businessman from London who had some untried seeds for new, sweeter strains of tobacco with him, as well as some untried marketing ideas. It was to turn out that John Rolfe held the key to the Colonys economic success.By 1612, Rolfes new strains of tobacco had been successfully cultivated and exported. Finally, a crop to export had been identified, and  plantations and new outposts sprung up, initially both upriver and downriver along the navigable portion of the James River, and thereafter along the other rivers and waterways of the area. The settlement at Jamestown could finally be considered permanently established.() Relations In 1620, a successor to the Plymouth Company sent colonists to the New World aboard the Mayflower. Known as Pilgrims, they successfully established a settlement in what became Massachusetts. The portion of what had been Virginia north of the 40th parallel became known as England, according to books written by Captain John Smith, who had made a voyage there.In 1624, the Virginia Companys charter was revoked by King James I and the Virginia Colony was transferred to royal authority as a colony. Subsequent charters for the Colony in 1632 and the Colony in 1665 further reduced the Virginia Colony to coastal borders it held until the Revolution. Names and nicknames for Virginia Charles II gave Virginia the title of Old Dominion in gratitude of Virginias loyalty to the crown during the Civil War; Virginia  maintains Old Dominion as its state nickname. Accordingly, the University of Virginias athletic teams use Cavaliers as one of their nicknames, and Virginia has named one of the other state public universities Dominion University.See also*of Virginia*of colonial governors of Virginia*counties, cities, and towns of Virginia*Colonies*colonial empireReferencesFurther reading* Heinemann, Ronald L., John G.

Wallsend
Wallsend is an area in Tyneside, and Wear, England. Wallsend derives its name as the location of the end of Wall.  It has a population of 42,842.(Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Urban Areas : Table KS01 : Usual Resident Population Retrieved 2009-08-26)HistoryRomansIn Roman times, Wallsend hosted the fort Segedunum. This fort protected the eastern end of Wall. In dedication to the Romans, Latin signs are dotted throughout the town.19th century to presentSeveral urban sanitary districts were formed in the parish in the late 19th century : Quay, Howdon and Wallsend itself.  The first two joined to form the Willington Quay district under the Government Act 1894, with the portion of the parish outside any urban sanitary district forming the parish of Willington in Rural District.  Wallsend became incorporated as a borough in 1901, and in 1910 took over Willington Quay and Willington, and also part of the parish of Longbenton.ShipbuildingWallsend has a history of shipbuilding and was the home of the Richardson shipyard, which later amalgamated to form Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson, probably best known for building the RMS Mauretania. This express liner held the Riband, for the fastest crossing of the Atlantic, for 22 years.Other famous ships included the RMS Carpathia which rescued the survivors from the Titanic in 1912, and the icebreaker Krasin (launched as Sviatogor) which rescued the Nobile expedition on Spitsbergen in 1928, when Amundsen perished. The story is retold in the movie Red Tent, starring Connery and Finch.Charles Parsons launched his revolutionary Turbinia here in 1884, thus not only revolutionising the navies of the world, but also, through the large-scale production of affordable electricity, making a significant contribution to the modern age. He features in a BBC film called The Inventor of the Twentieth Century.Russian novelist Zamyatin worked at Swan Hunter in 1916-17, and used it as background for his great anti-utopian work We which was a major influence on George Orwells-Eighty-Four.WWII ships built here include HMS Sheffield and HMS Victorious which took part in the sinking of the Bismarck. Other ships built there include the new Ark Royal in the 80sThe shipyard closed in 2007. The former Slipway & Engineering Company Shipyard continues to operate, constructing offshore oil rigs and as a TV studio, productions from there include the hit ITV drama Vera starring Brenda Blethyn and Inspector George Gently starring Martin Shaw.Coal miningMuch of Wallsends early industry was driven by coal mining. The Wallsend Colliery consisted of 7 pits which were active between 1778 and 1935. In the 1820s the pits became incorporated as Russells Colliery, which then became The Wallsend and Hebburn Coal Company Ltd. By 1924 the colliery employed 2183 people. Its most prominent manager was mining and railway engineer Buddle who helped develop the Lamp.Between 1767 and 1925 there were 11 major incidents recorded at the colliery resulting in over 209 deaths. On 18 June 1835 a gas explosion in one of the tunnels killed 102 miners. The youngest was 8 years old and the oldest 75 years old. Many of the dead bodies were found with their cloth caps in their mouth. This was believed to be an attempt to stop the inhalation of the gas which eventually killed them. The bodies were extracted and buried in St.Peters churchyard at the top of the bank overlooking the Wallsend Burn. A plaque has been erected within the churchyard to commemorate this tragedy.Recent historyThe town has expanded greatly in terms of housing since the end of World War II, and since the 1960s.Wallsend Town Centre - including the main shopping area (Known as the Wallsend Forum) - is in fact to the west of the land covered by the town. To the north of this area lies the older estate of High Farm and the new estate of Hadrian Lodge. The town centre of Wallsend is separated from the eastern areas of the town by Wallsend Burn, a stream runs through a small glacial valley running north-west to south-east until it flows into the River Tyne. To the east of the Burn is the old area of Holy Cross (that contains the ruins of a medieval church), the pre-war estate of Rosehill and the (mainly) post-war estate of Howdon. To the south of Howdon lies Willington Quay which, as it name suggests, once served shipping but which is now dominated by industry and housing. East Howdon forms a small enclave between Willington Quay and North Shields.   The towns principal thoroughfare and shopping street is the High Street. To the north of this street is Wallsend Green, the towns most picturesque area, consisting of large houses surrounding a green square. Behind the Green, the Burn runs through the parkland of the Hall Grounds, to Wallsend Park, a traditional British municipal park, whose restoration has frequently been demanded by local residents. Work on this restoration is due to start soon with many improvements such as a skate/BMX park, better pathways, and a rebuilding of the Duffy Memorial Fountain.The town is home to Boys Club, an football club, which has produced many famous players such as Shearer, Lee Clark,Steve Watson Beardsley Robbie Elliot, Mick Tait and Carrick. It is also hometown and birthplace to internationally successful musician, Sting.Image:Wallsend platfom 2 02.jpg|Wallsend metro station with Latin signs visible.Image:Forum Venaticium.jpg| An image of the local Centre at the metro station, with a Latin name: Forum Venalicium (slave market)Wallsend Metro Station serves the town and, in honour of the Roman fort, has Latin and English signs.Notable citizens*Kennedy - Historian*Laws- Footballer & Manager*Andrew Leslie - Shipbuilder*McDine - Darts Player*McKay (UK politician) - MP for Wallsend 1945 - 1964*Ochre - Electronic Musician*Carrick - Footballer*Dan Smith - Regional Politician*Paul Stephenson - Footballer*Sting - Musician*Alan Thompson - Footballer*Thorman - Rugby League Player*(band) - Band*Bruce - Footballer and Manager*Watson - Footballer*Wilson - Darts Player*Gaddes  - opera administratorSee also*Point PleasantReferencesExternal links* Tyne and Wear Archives Service: historical information on Wallsend*Read a detailed historic record about Wallsend Roman Fort* Tyne and Wear Archives Service: RMS Mauretania website*http://www.myersnorth.co.uk For Zamyatin, Orwells Nineteen Eighty-Four and Wallsend* Iconic images of Wallsend, Tanker Tyne Pride overlooking terraced houses.da:Wallsendde:Wallsendfr:Wallsendit:Wallsendnl:Wallsendno:Wallsendnn:Wallsendpl:Wallsendro:Wallsend

Svealand
right|thumb|Swedens historical four lands.Image:map svealand.png|frame|right|Svealand. Vrmland was counted to Gtaland until the 19th century, which is indicated on the map by a darker shade.Svealand (), Swealand or (rarely or historically) proper() is the historical core region of Sweden. It is located in south central Sweden and is one of three of Sweden, bounded to the north by Norrland and to the south by Gtaland. Deep forests, Tiveden, Tylskog, Kolmrden, separated Svealand from Gtaland. Historically, its inhabitants were called Svear, whereof an English version is the Swea. Svealand consists of the capital region Mlardalen in the east, Roslagen to the north-east, the former mining district Bergslagen in the center, and Dalarna and Vrmland in the west.The older name of Sweden in Swedish, Svea rike (modern spelling: Sverige) or the Realm of the Swedes, Swea Region, originally only referred to Svealand. Other forms are Sweoeod (Norse/Icelandic Svj), and Sweorice. As the domains of the Swedish kings grew, the name Svealand began to be used to separate the original territory from the new. Provinces Svealand is made up of the following six provinces:*Dalarna*Nrke*Sdermanland*Uppland*Vrmland*VstmanlandStockholm, the Swedish capital, is located in both Uppland and Sdermanland, and  a border stone can be found in the street Vsterlnggatan in Stockholm Old Town (Gamla stan).48px|Dalarna48px|Nrke48px|Sdermanland48px|Uppland48px|Vrmland48px|Vstmanland History Svealand was the original Sweden, to which it gave its name. This is supported by linguistics and is based on early medieval sources, such as the sagas. In Norse and in Old English, Svealand and Sweden are synonymous, and described as a separate country from Gtaland/Gautland/Geatland. *In af Nokkrum() for instance, Kolmrden between Svealand and stergtland is described as the border between Sweden and stergtland (...Kolmerkr, er skilr Svj ok Eystra-Gautland...).*In saga,() king I rides to Sweden through stergtland: Ingi konungr fr me hir sna ok sveit nokkura ok hafi ltinn her. Hann rei austr um Smland ok  eystra Gautland ok sv  Svj.*Sweoland is mentioned in the travels of of Hlogaland around 890.*The lord Jonsson Grip was probably the one who was best acquainted with the geography of the Swedish kingdom since he owned more than half of it. In 1384, he stated in his will that the kingdom consisted of Swerige (Sweden, i.e. Svealand), sterland (i.e. Finland) and Gthaland (i.e. Gtaland).*The 15th century Swedish version of the irekssaga says that Vilkinaland was formerly a name for Sweden (Swerige) and Gtaland: wilcina land som nw r kalladh swerige oc gtaland.A crusade to the east started by the kings of Svealand during the 12th century eventually conquered the provinces of sterland, an older name for Finland.In the early Middle Ages the modern province of Gstrikland was part of Tiundaland, one of the three constituent parts of the modern province of Uppland, and therefore counted as a part of Svealand.For a time in the early 19th century, the province of Vrmland  belonged to the Court of Appeal for Svealand. Even though Vrmland historically belonged to Gtaland (from 1815 until a new court, Hovrtten fr Vstra Sverige, was instituted), it has by custom long been considered part of Svealand.

Located near the Highway, it has no permanent population. Interpretive information is provided by the and Aishihik First Nations.Little SalmonLittle Salmon is located on the Campbell Highway between Faro and Carmacks, and stretches along the lake of the same name and the River. The only non-residential establishment is the Yukon government highway maintenance camp at Creek. It was formerly an important settlement of the Salmon/Carmacks First Nation.Miners PrayerMiners Prayer was settled near the River Mining Concern, providing a retreat where the miners could endulge in billiards, alcohol and other entertainment otherwise forbidden on the mining settlement.  Today it is home to fewer than thirty permanent residents.  It can be accessed by gravel road veering West from mile 57 on the Highway.Silver CitySilver City, a historic mining town, is today only the residence of a small number of people, one household being a and breakfast establishment. It is located at historical mile 1053 of the Highway.Stewart RiverStewart River is a former settlement at the juncture of the Yukon and Stewart rivers. A few buildings and cabins remain, as well as private museum, which are threatened by erosion. It was founded as a trading post in the 1880s before the Gold Rush to serve placer miners working along the Stewart River. The Burian family was still living there in the late 1980s.SulphurSulphur or Sulphur Creek was a mining camp south-east of Dawson on a creek of the same name that flows into the Indian River.

University_of_Queensland
 coorThe University of Queensland, also known as UQ, is a university located in Brisbane, Australia. Founded in 1909, it is the oldest university in Queensland and the fifth in the nation. The main campus is located in St Lucia, southwest of the Brisbane CBD. UQ is a member of the Australias Group of Eight lobby group, and the 21, an international network of research-intensive universities, and is colloquially known as a sandstone university.UQ is ranked among the top universities, both in Australia and the world.(http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2011)(Rating Major Disciplines in Australian  Universities - Perceptions and Reality)()  In 2009, the Australian Cancer Research Foundation reported that UQ have taken the lead in numerous areas of cancer research, having awarded almost $10 million in grants over a three year period.( )There are numerous collaborative research centres associated with the university. The Queensland Bioscience Precinct on the St Lucia campus houses scientists from the Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Institute for Molecular Bioscience (IMB). The Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology and the Queensland Brain Institute (QBI) are located close by and together these institutes form one of the largest biomedical research clusters in Australia.()HistoryThe University of Queensland (UQ) was established on 10 December 1909  by the Parliament to mark the 50th anniversary of Queenslands independence from South Wales. The Universitys first classes in the Government house were held in 1911, with 83 commencing students. The development of the University was delayed by War I, but after the first world war the university enrollments for education and research took flight as demand for education increased in Australia. Thus, in the early 1920s the growing University had to look for a more spacious campus as its original site at George Street, Brisbane has limited room for expansion.()In 1927, Dr James ONeil Mayne and his sister Emelia Mayne, provided a grant of approximately 50,000 to the City Council to acquire  of land at St Lucia and provided it to the University of Queensland as its permanent home.( Lack of finance delayed development of the St Lucia campus. Hence, the construction of the Universitys first building in St Lucia only began in 1938. It was later named the Forgan Smith Building, after the Premier of the day and was completed in 1939. During War II, the Forgan Smith Building was used as a military base and it served first as advanced headquarters for the Allied Land Forces in the South West Pacific.(In 1990, Australia reorganized its higher education system by abolishing the binary system of universities and colleges of advanced education. Under this transition, the University merged with Queensland Agricultural College, to establish the new UQ Gatton campus. In 1999, UQ Ipswich began operation as one of the completely Web-enabled campuses in Australia.(RankingsAccording to the 2007 World University Rankings, UQ is the only Queensland university in the top 50 (ranked 33rd along with the University of Singapore), and one of only six Australian universities in the top 50.() In 2009, the university was ranked 41st, after of Melbourne (36), of Sydney (36) and National University (17).(The Times Higher Education Supplement) In 2011, World University Rankings(http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2011) placed the university in 48th (in 2010 Higher Education World University Rankings and World University Rankings parted ways to produce separate rankings).The Shanghai Jiao Tong Universitys Academic Ranking of World Universities also placed UQ among the top 10 universities in the Asia Pacific Region.( UQ was also featured in 2006 Newsweek and 2009 University Ranking of the worlds top 100 universities.()(The 1st hundred  Global universities ranking)The following publications ranked universities worldwide. The University of Queensland ranked:Academia and ResearchUQ research led by Professor Frazer pioneered a vaccine for cervical cancer.() The vaccine Gardasil protects against an approximate 70 percent of human papillomavirus-related cervical cancers. Previously, more than 270,000 women died from the disease each year.In 2009, UQ researchers led by Professor Scott ONeill successfully infected aedes mosquito with a bacterium that halves the mosquitoes 30-day lifespan, thereby reducing its ability to transmit fever to humans. The international research team at UQ was funded by a $9 million donation from the & Melinda Gates Foundation.()The HyShot Flight Program which involves the worlds first flight tests of a scramjet using supersonic combustion was designed by UQ.()University EventsUQ hosts a number of academic events. In 2008, the university originated the Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition for students completing a higher degree by research. Three Minute Thesis is now held annually at universities across Australasia. It challenges participants to present their research in just 180 seconds, in an engaging form that can be understood by an intelligent audience with no background in the research area. This exercise develops presentation, research and academic communication skills and supports the development of research students capacity to explain their work effectively.()CampusSt Lucia campusUQ was established on 10 December 1909, with Sir MacGregor as first chancellor (with Heber Roe as vice-chancellor) and was originally situated in Brisbanes downtown area on George Street.( In 1927, the land on which the St Lucia campus is built was resumed by the City Council using money donated by James ONeil Mayne and his sister Emelia Mayne to replace the less spacious city campus. The city campus is now home to the Gardens Point campus of the University of Technology. Construction of the new university began at St Lucia in 1937.(The University has its main campus in the suburb of St Lucia in Brisbane. Its other campuses include Ipswich, Gatton, Herston, South Brisbane, Turbot Street and Moggill. It is situated on a point of the River. At its centre is the heritage-listed Great Court  a  open area surrounded by sandstone buildings with grotesques of great academics and historic scenes, floral and faunal motifs and crests of universities and colleges from around the world.() This central semi-circular quadrangle features a connected arcade so students could reach any section under cover.The  also includes sporting fields, gardens, duckponds, and cycling tracks. The athletics centre features 21 floodlit tennis courts and Olympic-standard swimming pool, a three-level gymnasium and a multi-purpose indoor centre. The university is served by a CityCat wharf, two bus stations and is also served by the Eleanor Schonell Bridge providing pedestrian and bus access across the river to Dutton Park.2009 saw the opening of the $2.5 million Advanced Concepts Teaching Space (ACTS) lecture theatre which enable students to use mobile technology to aid classroom learning.()Gatton campusLocated in Queensland about 90 km west of Brisbane on the Warrego Highway. UQ Gatton, formerly the Queensland Agricultural College, was opened in 1897 as a combined agricultural college and experimental farm.( The QAC amalgamated with UQ in 1990. UQ Gatton is serviced by the UQ Gatton Student Association and remains affiliated with the UQ Student Union.UQ Gatton offers courses in agriculture, animal science, environmental management, agronomy/agribusiness, equine studies, wildlife and bushland studies and other fields relating to natural and rural environments. Its facilities include over  of agricultural land, animal production operations, a recently redeveloped equine centre, and facilities for wildlife studies, facilities and laboratories, and a branch of the UQ Library. Some of the original QAC buildings are still standing, such as the Foundation Building.2010 saw the relocation of the Vet School to the UQ Gatton Campus achieving a single-site strategy for all UQ animal production and health activities.  There are new facilities for animal science, health, welfare and production along with the combination of the relocated School of Veterinary Science, and the newly completed Centre for Advanced Animal Science (CAAS). There are currently plans to possibly move plant scientists to the Gatton campus, thereby boosting its research profile as well as ensuring both plant and animal scientists are co-located at the one campus.Ipswich campusThe Ipswich campus, opened in 1999, after State and Federal government backing is the newest campus, made up of nearly 20 buildings and more than 4000 students on nearly (Ipswich History) Courses offered include: arts, business and social sciences as well as design. In 2009, a cohort of 39 students became the pioneers to undertake medicine at the Ipswich campus.It is located near central Queensland, just south of the CBD. Nearby landmarks include Limestone Park, The Workshops Railway Museum and the Base Amberley.The site dates back to 1878 with the opening of the Ipswich branch of the Woogaroo Lunatic Asylum. Operations continued until 1910 when it became the Ipswich Hospital for the Insane.( In 1938 it was renamed the Ipswich Mental Hospital and in 1964 it was renamed again as the Ipswich Special Hospital. It was finally named the Challinor Centre in 1968 in honour of Dr. Henry Challinor, the ships surgeon on the Fortitude. From 1968 to 1997 the Challinor Centre served as an institution for people with disabilities. In late 1997 the Challinor Centre began its first stage of transformation as the new UQ Ipswich campus.(Other facilitiesIsland, Australia - Harbour and HIRS from helicopter.JPG|thumb|Helicopter view of Heron Island Research StationThere are other research and education facilities not attached directly to the three campuses.

Oaxaca,_Oaxaca
:Oaxaca is the name of both a state in Mexico and that states capital city. This article is about the city/municipality. For the state, see Oaxaca.footnotes                Link         http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/415The city and municipality of Oaxaca de Jurez, or simply Oaxaca, is the capital and largest city of the Mexican state of the same name (Oaxaca). It is located in the Centro District in the Central Valleys region of the state,  in the foothills of the Sierra Madre at the base of the Cerro del Fortn extending to the banks of the River.()  This city relies heavily on tourism, which is based on its large number of colonial-era structures as well as the native Zapotec and Mixtec cultures and archeological sites.( It, along with the archeological site of Alban, were named a Heritage Site in 1987.()  It is also the home of the month-long cultural festival called the Guelaguetza, which features Oaxacan dance, music and a beauty pageant for indigenous women.() It is nicknamed la Verde Antequera (the green Antequera) due to its prior name (Nueva Antequera) and the variety of structures built from a native green stone.() The name Oaxaca is derived from the Nahuatl name for the place, Huaxyacac, which was Hispanicized to Guajaca, later spelled Oaxaca. de Jurez was added in honor of Jurez, who was a native of this state. The coat of arms for the municipality bears the image of the decapitated Donaji, who was an indigenous princess in the years immediately after the Conquest.(HistoryThere had been Zapotec and Mixtec settlements in of Oaxaca for thousands of years, especially in connection with the important ancient centers of Monte Albn and Mitla, which are close to modern Oaxaca city.(  The Aztecs entered the valley in 1440 and named it Huaxyacac, a Nahuatl phrase meaning among the huaje (leucocephala) trees. A strategic military position was created here, at what is now called the Cerro (large hill) del Fortn to keep an eye on the Zapotec capital of Zaachila and secure the trade route between the of Mexico, Tehuantepec and what is now America.() When the Spanish arrived in 1521, the Zapotecs and the Mixtecs were involved in one of their many wars. Spanish conquest would end this fighting.() The first Spanish expedition here arrived late in 1521, headed by Captain Francisco de Orozco, and accompanied by 400 Aztecs.( Corts sent Francisco de Orozco to Oaxaca because II said that the Aztecs gold came from there.( The Spanish expedition under Orozco set about building a Spanish city where the Aztec military post was at the base of the Cerro de Fortn. The first mass was said here by Chaplain Juan Diaz on the bank of the Atoyac River under a large huaje tree, where the Church of San Juan de Dios would be constructed later. This same chaplain added saints names to the surrounding villages in addition to keeping their Nahuatl names: Santa Mara Oaxaca, Martn Mexicapan, Juan Chapultepec, Tomas Xochimilco, Matas Jalatlaco, Tepeaca, etc. This group of Spaniards chose their first mayor, Gutierres de Badajoc, their first town council and began construction of the cathedral of Oaxaca in 1522. Their name for the settlement was Guajaca, a Hispanization of the Nahuatl name (which would later be respelled as Oaxaca).( The establishment of the relatively-independent village did not suit Hernn Cortes, who wanted power over the entire region for himself. Corts sent de Alvarado, who proceeded to drive out most of the villages population. The original Spanish settlers appealed to the Spanish crown to recognize the village they founded, which it did in 1526, with land divided among the Spaniards of Orozcos expedition. However, this did not stop Corts from driving out the population of the village once again and replacing the town council only three months after royal recognition. Once again, the original founders appealed to Spanish royal authority, this time to the viceroy in Mexico City, de Guzmn. This viceroy also sided with the original founders, and the town was refounded in 1529 as Antequera, in honor of Nuo de Guzmns hometown. Francisco de Herrera convened the new, Crown-approved town council,( and the first layout of the settlement was mapped out by Juan Pelez de Berrio.(In the meantime, Corts was able to obtain from the crown the title of the Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca, which contains the disputed village. This permitted him to tax the area heavily, and to have control of the territory that surrounded the village. The village was then in a position of having to survive surrounded by villages which answered to Corts. These villages not only did not take orders from Antequera, they were hostile to it, mostly likely encouraged by Corts.(To counter this, the village petitioned the Crown to be elevated to the status of a city, which would give it certain rights, privileges and exceptions. It would also ensure that the settlement would remain under the direct control of the king, rather than of Corts. This petition was granted in 1532 by V of Spain.((After the Independence of Mexico in 1821, the city became the seat of a municipality, and both the name of the city and the municipality became Oaxaca, changed from Antequera. In 1872, de Jurez as added to the city and municipality names to honor Benito Jurez, who began his legal and political career here.(The Oaxaca protests began as a teachers protest, occupying the main square, or Zocalo, of Oaxaca city in May 2006. Increases in wages and employment benefits were announced a short time later, but an internal conflict in the local teachers union led to accusations that the bargaining had not really been in the teachers best interest. Work stoppage and occupation of the square continued from May 22 to June 1. At this point, radical groups joined in with the protest and the disorder grew, closing banks, access roads, the airport, access to stores and harassing the governor of the state in public appearances. Many of these groups merged with the teachers union to form the Popular Assembly of the People of Oaxaca (APPO). The disruption turned into a siege that lasted five months.(  Violence included the deaths of a number of  people including Indymedia journalist Roland Will on October 27, 2006() and Roberto Lpez Hernndez and Jorge Alberto Beltrn on October 29, 2006 when over 10,000 federal police and army intervened.()() The situation calmed in the second week of November when the Federal Preventative Police took over the city and disbanded the protests.(Economy and tourismThe events of 2006 had a severe impact on the citys main generator of revenue: tourism.( The city is the primary attraction of the state, which also relies economically on tourism. Over the last 25 years, tourism grew to become be dominant factor of Oaxacas economy.()  77% of the municipality of Oaxaca has employment related in some way to tourism.  The attractions are the verdant landscapes of the Oaxaca Valley, and the architectural and cultural charms of the city itself.(The next largest economic sectors are mining and manufacturing, which employ 20% of the work force.(The city centre was included in a Heritage Site designated by UNESCO, in recognition of its treasure of historic buildings and monuments.() Tourist activity peaks in three seasons: Holy Week, summer (especially during Guelaguetza) and Year. Many of the tourists who come during Week and for New Year come from other parts of Mexico and include native Oaxacans returning to visit from their places of work. Most international visitors come in the summer.(Notable sitesPlaza de la Constitucin or ZocaloThe Plaza de la Constitucin, or Zcalo, was planned out in 1529 by Juan Pelez de Berrio. During the entire colonial period this plaza was never paved, nor had sidewalks, only a marble fountain that was placed here in 1739. This was removed in 1857 to put in the kiosk and trees were planted. In 1881, the vegetation here was rearranged and in 1885, a statue of Benito Jurez was added. It was remodeled again in 1901 and a new Noveau kiosk installed. Fountains of green stone with capricious figures were installed in 1967.( The kiosk in the center hosts the State Musical Band, La Marimba and other groups.() The plaza is surrounded by various portals. On the south side of the plaza are the Portales de Ex-Palacio de Gobierno, which was vacated by the government in 2005 and then reopened as a museum called Museo del Palacio Espacio de Diversidad  Other portals include the Portal de Mercadores on the eastern side, Portal de Claverias on the north side and the Portal del Seor on the west side.(The State Government Palace is located on the main square of Oaxaca City. This site used to be the Portal de la Alhndiga (warehouse) and in front of the palace is the Benito Juarez Market. The original palace was inaugurated in 1728, on the wedding day of the prince and princess of Spain and Portugal. The architectural style was Gothic. The building currently on this site was begun in 1832, inaugurated in 1870 but was not completed until 1887. The inside contains murals reflecting Oaxacas history from the pre-Hispanic era, the colonial era and post-Independence. Most of these were painted by Garcia Bustos in the 1980s.(The Federal Palace is located across from the Cathedral and used to be the site of the old Archbishiops Palace until 1902. Its architecture is neo-Mixtec reflecting the nationalism of the early 20th century and the reverence in which the Mixtec-Zapotec culture has been held in more recent times. The architectural elements copy a number of those from Mitla and Monte Alban.(Northwest of the Zcalo is the Alameda de Len, a garden area ( that is essentially an annex of the main square. In 1576, viceroy Enrquez de Almanza set aside two city blocks on which to build the city government offices, but they were never built here. One of the blocks was sold and the other became a market. Antonio de Len, governor of the state of Oaxaca, lived in front of this market and decided to turn it into a park in the 1840s, making it a small replica of the Alameda Central in Mexico City. In 1885, a statue of Len was added.(Andador Macedonio AlcalThe Macedonio Alcal Tourist Corridor is a street paved with green cantera that was closed to traffic in 1985( and is now only open to pedestrian traffic. Along the street are notable places such as the original building to house the Autnoma Benito Jurez. The Museo de Arte Contemporneo (Museum of Contemporary Art) or MACO is located here as is the Plazuela (small plaza) Labastida and the Parroquia de la Preciosa Sangre de Cristo (Parish of the Precious Blood of Christ).(Churches and religious buildingsThe de Oaxaca, also referred to as Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption, is the third to be built as the first two were destroyed by large earthquakes in the 16th and 18th centuries.(  Construction of this third church began in 1702 and it was consecrated in 1733. Its facade is made of the green cantera stone commonly found in Oaxacas buildings, and the interior is in Neoclassical style. The altar features a statue of Our Lady of the Assumption (Nuestra Seora de al Asuncin) which was made in Italy during the Porfirio era,( who is represented by a bronze sculpture brought from Europe and made by Tadoini.() Domingo de Guzmn Church.The church and former monastery of Santo Domingo de Guzmn is located 4 blocks north of the Cathedral of Oaxaca. It was constructed between 1555 and 1666. It divides into two parts: the church and the former living/working areas of the monks. The front of the church is Renaissance-style, in the central relief, Dominic and of Rome are holding up the church. After Reforma around 1860, the church was converted into a stable, which caused serious deterioration of the building. It was returned to devotional use at the end of the 19th century. The living and working areas were converted into barracks and officers quarters. In 1994, work began to convert this area as the Centro Cultural Santo Domingo.( The de Nuestra Seora de la Soledad is located four blocks west of the Cathedral on Avenida Independencia. It is built between 1682 and 1697 by Father Fernando Mndez( on a site where supposedly an image of the Mary appeared inside a box. It is of Baroque style finished in 1690. Its front is made of a reddish stone sculpted to look like a folding screen. In the back of the church is the de la Basilica de Nuestra Seora de La Soledad that exhibits the Virgins dresses, offering and small painting done in her honor.( The statue of the Virgin of Solitude, crowned with a 2 kg solid gold crown studded with diamonds &ndash; was the subject of a theft recently. Many years later, the cloister was converted into a correctional facility, a teachers college and district attorneys office. Now it serves as the Municipal Palace. The building conserves a number of valuable items such as paintings, sculptures and religious vestments( and a organ dated 1686.() The Church and ex-monastery of Del Carmen Alto belonged to the Carmelites who established themselves here in 1696. The complex began as a hermitage built over the teocalli of Huaxyacac, although in the late 17th century, much of this space was occupied by a jail and barracks. The project was financed by Manuel Fernandez Fiallo.(Church and former monastery of St John of God (Templo y Exconvento de San Juan de Dios), Oaxacas oldest church still standing, completed in 1703. This is where the first mass in Oaxaca was held in 1521.(thumb|Calle Tinoco y Palacios, with the church of San Felipe NeriChurch of San Felipe Neri The Church of San Felipe Neri is considered a classic example of Baroque with estipite (inverted truncated pyramid) columns from the end of the 18th century, and has a large gilded main altarpiece. While the church overall is Baroque, the portal contains other decorative elements as well. Benito Jurez married Margarita Maza here in 1841.(Ex monastery of San Catalina was built in the second half of the 16th century by Dominican monk Hernando de Carvarcos, who also was responsible for the Santo Domingo de Guzmn monastery. In 1862, the monastery became a jail and at the end of the 19th century, the southern part became the Municipal Palace. Since 1976, it has been a hotel, called Hotel Camino Real.(Church of the Company of Jesus (Iglesia de la Compaia de Jess), located to the southwest of the Zcalo, was built by the Jesuits in 1579 and consecrated to Xavier and the Conception.( The towers were destroyed by a series of earthquakes and never rebuilt. Inside the chapel is a statue of the of Guadalupe with a prayer written in Spanish, English, Nhuatl as well as 12 other languages native to the state of Oaxaca, including 4 dialects of Zapotec.(Museums and the artsThe Centro Cultural de Santo Domingo occupies the former monastery buildings attached to Santo Domingo church, and were restored in 1996 and considered to be one of the best restoration works in America.() Some important artifacts from Monte Alban are displayed here. In the center of the Centro Cultural, there is a courtyard with a fountain and a very large staircase. The passages along the courtyard have vaulted ceilings, cupolas and intricate corridors. Much of the Centro Cultural is occupied by the Museo de las Culturas de Oaxaca (Museum of Oaxacan Cultures), whose entrance is the one pilgrims used to use to enter the church area of the complex.( This museum was placed in the Centro Cultural in 1964, after originally being in the Instituto de Ciencias y Artes, among other places. The museum specializes in Zapotec and Mixtec cultures, covering ten halls and one auditorium.( In Sala III is displayed the Tesoro Mixteco(Mixtec Treasure) which is a collection of offerings that were discovered by archeologist Caso in Tomb 7 of Monte lban. These offerings include hundreds of pieces of jewelry made of gold and silver. They make up the richest collection of gold and silver smithing of ancient Mexico.( Another important exhibit is the objects from Tomb 5 of Lambitieco, which dates back to 700 C. E and from Monte Alban. The museum has rooms dedicated to everyday items from the colonial period as well.( The center also contains the Biblioteca Fray Francisco de Burgoa (Fray Francisco de Burgoa Library) which holds over 25,000 degrees that were conferred from the 15th to the 20th century from the Universidad Autnoma Benito Jurez in Oaxaca.( The Museum of Contemporary Art (de Arte Contemporaneo de Oaxaca, MACO) is housed in the so-called Casa de Corts. It is one of the oldest buildings in the city and one of the most representative of non-religious buildings.( However, since it dates from after the death of Hernn Corts, it could never actually have served as his house.( Although it has been modified somewhat over the years, it still conserves its basic layout with rooms surrounding three courtyards. The architectural style is basically Andalucian modified by Oaxaca traditions.  The facade has two levels, and the doors and windows have lintels, and are protected by iron railings. To the far left of the facade, there are two arched entrances that permitted entrance of carriages to the third courtyard. The main portal is Spanish Baroque and has three levels. In the first, there are two tritstila columns that support the balcony which has wrought iron railings. On the second level two columns flanking a window. The jambs of the window are decorated with circles and the lintel with inverted curves. At the top of the window is seal of the Jesuits. The third level contains a central niche with a sculpture of an archangel as well as the coats of arms of the Laso de la Vega and the Pinelo families. This group is flanked by Solomonic columns. The house was acquired by the state of Oaxaca and initially housed the Museo Historico Urbano de Oaxaca in 1986.( The museum was created with help from the state government, the Jos F. Gmez Foundation, painter Toledo and the Nacional de Bellas Artes. It permanent collection contains works by Tamayo, Toledo, Nieto, Aquinos and others.(The Museo de los Pintores Oaxaqueos(Museum of Oaxacan Painters) is located north of the Alameda de Len on Avenida Independencia in a former 18th century mansion. It is dedicated to local artists such as Morales whose work is on permanent display. The museum has also featured exhibitions by Morales, Nieto, Santiago and Toledo.(The Casa de Culturas Oaxaqueas used to the Church and ex monastery Los Siete Prncipes dating from the 18th century. The only part still used for religious purposes is the small chapel. The complex was restored in the 1960s and in 1970, the Casa opened.( It houses the  Instituto Oaxaqueo de la Culturas, which  is a state government entity to promote culture and the arts.(The Rufino Tamayo Museum (Museo Arte Prehispnico de Rufino Tamayo) or Rufino Tamayo, has an important collection of pre-Hispanic art that the painter himself collected. He donated the collection, as well as the house that is now the museum to his home state (Oaxaca) in 1974.( This house, which was known as the Casa de Villanaza, was built in 18th century. It first housed the State Museum Archives, before becoming what it is today.( The museum exhibits over 1150 pieces from different Mesoamerican periods, including Mayan steles, ceramic dogs from Colima and stone faces from the of Mexico coast. The purpose of the museum is to show the aesthetic as well as the cultural value of these works.( The Religious Museum of the Ex monastery of La Soledad is located next to the Basilica of la Soledad. It contains objects such as paintings, sculptures and vestments. It is located in the southwest portion of the old monastery.( The Instituto de Artes Grficos de Oaxaca (Graphic Arts Institute of Oaxaca) contains a large collection of graphic designs both present and past.(The Casa de Jurez, is a museum devoted to the life of Benito Jurez.( It belonged to someone named Antonio Salanueva,( but Jurez lived here from 1818 to 1828 after arriving to Oaxaca city from his hometown of Guelatao.( It contains documents related to his presidency as well as furnishings designed to recreate the environment of that period. Its architecture is typical of homes built in this city in the 18th century and located on Garcia Vigil 609.( It also contains ordinary artifacts from that time period, some of which belonged to Jurez.(Hemeroteca Publica de Oaxaca Nestor Snchez (Nestor Sanchez Public Newspaper Library of Oaxaca) is located behind the ex-convent of Santo Domingo along with the Jardin Ethobotnico (Ethnobotanic Gardin) at the corner of Reforma and Constitucin. These two occupy more than 2 hectares which used to be the gardens of the convent of Santa Domingo.(Teatro Macedonio Alcal, which as well as being a working theatre houses a collection of romantic art. .( The Macedonio Alcal Theater is a work typical for Porfirio Diaz period at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. It was first named the Luis Mier y Tern Theater, then Jess Carranza. The current name dates back to 1932 to honor the composer of the state anthem Dios Nunca Muere (God Never Dies).( The Macedonio Acal Theatre is named after the author of the state anthem and was built between 1903 and 1909. The theatre has three parts, the vestibule, the main hall and the stage. The main entrance is on the corner. On the Armenta and Lopez Street sides, the lower level is occupied by shops, as well as the Miguel Cabrera Salon, which hosts art exhibits. The vestibule is Louis XV style with a white marble staircase and the main hall is in Imperial style, in which the anthropomorphic columns stand out.(Other cultural places of interest include the Alvarez Bravo Photography Center, the Oaxaca Stamp Museum, the Railway Museum of Southern Mexico (in the old train station) and the Planetarium located on the Cerro del Fortn.(Monte AlbanAlbn is a pre-Hispanic city that was an ancient capital of the Zapotecs. It reached its peak between 500 BCE and 800 CE with about 35,000 inhabitants. Monte Alban is known for its architecture, its carved stones and the ceramic urns. In 1987, it was declared a World Heritage Site, along with the city of Oaxaca itself.()MarketsThe Mercado (Market) Benito Jurez is located one block south of the Zcalo on Flores Magn and Las Casas but it takes up the entire block to 20 de Noviembre and Aldama streets. It offers flowers, fruit, ices, fruit drinks, handcrafts, leather goods, hats and knives, among other things.( The Mercado (Market)20 de Noviembre is the official name, but this market is commonly known as the Mercado de la Comida (food) because of the food stands that dominate the place. It is recommended by Mxico Desconocido magazine for Oaxacan regional dishes such as moles, tasajo, tlayudas, de yema (a type of egg bread), chapulines (fried grasshoppers in chile), cheese (known locally as quesillo), fresco (lit. fresh cheese), as well as very large cups of hot chocolate made locally that is often spiced with cinnamon and almonds.(Parks and gardensthumb|right|Ethnobotanical Garden at the Temple of Santo Domingo.The city contains a number of parks, gardens and plazas, many of which were former monastery lands. The Ethnobotanical Garden, surrounding the former monastery of Santo Domingo.( Even better known is the Plaza de la Danza y Jardn Scrates complex on Morelos Street at the foot of the Cerro del Fortn. It is part of the area bounded by the Basilica de la Soledad and the Church of San Jos. The Plaza de la Danza was constructed in 1959 by Eduardo Vasconcelos to hold the annual Bani-Stui-Gulal (representation of antiquity) dance, held one day before the festival of the Guelaguetza. The Plaza also hosts other cultural events including art shows, concerts and political rallies The Socrates Garden is the old atrium of the Basilica de la Soledad converted into a public park in 1881, conserved the bronze chalice which was also made in 1881. In 1981, the Garden was remodeled adding a new layer of stone to the floor.( The Cerro de Fortn next to it bears in stone letters Benito Jurezs slogan, El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz (Respect for others rights is peace).( The Antonia Labastida Garden is named alter a woman who fought with Porfirio Diaz during the French Intervention. This park has became a place for artists and artisans to display their wares.(Festivals and traditionsGuelaguetzaThe Guelaguetza, also known as the Fiestas de los Lunes del Cerro (Festivals of Mondays at the Hill) is the major cultural event in the city with origins in pre-Hispanic times. The Hill is the Cerro del Fortn, which was the scene of the annual rites to the goddess Centetl, or goddess of the corn. The hill had a teocalli, or sacred plaza, built by the Aztecs. The ritual would end with the sacrifice of a young maiden chosen to represent the goddess.(This rite was prohibited by the Spanish after the Conquest, who also destroyed the teocalli. In its place, they constructed the Church of Lady of Mount Carmen, now known as Carmen Alto. The recently baptized Mixtecs and Zapotecs then replaced ceremonies to Centetl with those to this manifestation of the Virgin Mary, at the same place, the Cerro del Fortn.(This revised festival grew over time to be the largest and most anticipated for the town. In 1932, the city of Oaxaca realized its 400th anniversary and decided to combine these festivities with those of the Cerro del Fortn, adding traditional dances, music, regional cuisine and Margarita Santaella as the first Miss Oaxaca, in addition to the religious rites. The word guelaguetza is from Zapotec and means offering, sympathy, caring and cooperation. This first Guelaguetza was such a hit that organizers decided to repeat it every year at the Cerro del Fortin, on all the Mondays of July starting in 1953, becoming an amalgam of Oaxacan festivals from many parts of the state.( Originally, the festival took place at the foot of the Cerro del Fortn, where the curve of the land makes for a natural theatre. Since 1974, many of the events, which have grown in number, have been moved to a number of different venues, included the then-inaugurated Guelaguetza Auditorium. This is a Greek-style venue with seats 11,400 people.(One venue is the Church of Santo Domingo de Guzmn, where regional band come to play, dressed in colorful costumes as part of the opening ceremonies. They march from here to the Oaxaca Cathedral, where they are joined by folk dance groups such as the China Oaxaqueas, the Chilenas de Pinotepa Nacional and the Jarabes Serranos. Another major event, which takes place at the Jardin Socrates, is a beauty pageant for indigenous women from different regions of Oaxaca state. The winner represents the goddess Centetl and presides over the festivities along with public officials. The Bamo-Stui-Gulal takes place at the Plaza de la Danza and represents the history of Oaxaca and the Guelaguetza itself. The Plaza is divided into four quadrants, each representing a different period in Oaxacas history. One other event, hosted in the Auditorium is a reenactment of the Legend of Donaj, which takes place at the time of the Conquest. On the streets of Oaxaca city, there are parades with children and giant mache puppets.(Noche de RbanosThe Noche de Rbano or Night of the Radishes is a traditional Oaxaca city tradition. Artisans show off designs done on large radishes, often decorated with other plant materials. The event only lasts a few hours but draws most of the citys population to the main square to look at the creations. It occurs each year on 23 December.() The event developed from a Dominican Christmas tradition, when they would have a large dinner on the night of 23 December. To decorate the tables, indigenous servants of the monks would carve radishes and adorn them with flowers and other plants. This led 23 December to the known as the Night of the Radishes. This led to a special market on this day selling the radishes along with two other popular Christmas plant materials, the Flor Inmortal (immortal flower) and corn husks. This market has grown into a major cultural event and now is sponsored by the city, which packs the main square on that day. The day also includes a competition where radish creations are judged by originality, technical skill and beauty.(DonajThe story of Donaj is that of a princess from pre-Hispanic Mitla. When she was born, a seer predicted that she would die for her country.  When she grew up, her people, the Zapotecs, were involved in one of their many wars with the Mixtecs. One day, Zapotec warriors brought a prisoner, a Mixtec prince named Nucano, to Mitla. Taking pity on him, she took care of his wounds. When he healed, he asked her to let him go, which she did. The war continued with the Zapotec king and Donaji forced to abandon their capital of Zaachila. Peace negotiations were attempted but the Mixtecs did not trust the Zapotec king, taking Donaj captive as insurance. This occurred during the Conquest, when the evangelization of the country had begun. Donaj asked for baptism and was renamed Doa Juana de Corts.()As feared, the Zapotecs broke the peace treaty, attacking Monte Alban as the Mixtecs slept. Donaj was found in the Atoyac River, decapitated. Time passed. One day a Shepard came to the place that Donaji was buried by the river. There was a fragrant lily flower growing. Fifteen days later, he returned to find the same flower, still fresh and fragrant in the same place as if a mysterious force was preserving it.(  Her decapitated head serves as part of the coat of arms of the city of Oaxaca( and her story is reenacted every year at the Guelaguetza festival.(Food and drinkThe city of Oaxaca has long been considered Mexicos culinary capital.(ONeil, Patrick H., Karl Fields and Don Share. Cases in Comparative Politics. New York: Norton, 2006. 366.) The most notable aspect of Oaxacan cuisine is its variety of moles, a type of complex sauce. Their origins go back to the melding of Spanish and Arabic food in Spain.  After the Conquest, New World ingredients such as chile mulato, miltomate (a small whitish wild tomato), tomatoes, peanuts, avocado leaves, and chocolate were incorporated.  While moles can be found in many parts of Mexico, Oaxaca has the greatest variety including negro (black), Colorado (red), coloradito (faint red), chichilo, verde (green), amarillo (yellow), and mancha manteles (lit. stainer of tablecloths). They are sold in markets all over the city as a paste which is combined with water and simmered with a variety of meats.()Other notable foods sold in markets include bars of chocolate (primarily used for making hot chocolate), traditional breads, and chapulines (fried grasshoppers with chile). Street foods include tlayudas, which are large, slightly crispy corn tortillas piled high with ingredients such as grilled beef (called tasajo), cheese, tomatoes, avocados, onions etc. Local drinks include those made with water, sugar and a flavoring such as aguamiel (honey water), de meln (melon), horchata (rice), batida (cactus fruit shake), and nuez (nuts) as well as local fruits such as chilacayota  and guanbana. In nearby Tlacolula and Ejutla an indigenous drink called tejate is still prepared and sold in the local market. Known here as the drink of the gods, it is prepared with corn, cacao, cacao flower and the seed of the mamey fruit. As for alcoholic beverages, this area prefers mezcal, which, like tequila is made from a species of agave but the flavor is very different.(As in other areas in Mexico, chocolate has had special importance here since long before the Conquest. Aside from being a foodstuff, it was also used as medicine and cacao seeds were used as money. The chocolate prepared in this city is well-known within Mexico, as it is distinguished by being flavored with cinnamon, almonds and sugar and is usually prepared with hot water or milk. It is usually served in large coffee cups with a local sweet roll. The best-known producer of this type of chocolate is Chocolate El Mayordomo, which recently has opened outlets in various parts of Mexico, esp. in Mexico City. In their main store in Oaxaca City, you can see them prepare the various types of chocolates they prepare including a chocolate pasta.(Notable Oaxacans*Jurez*Daz*Vasconcelos*Flores Magn*Morales, artist*Tamayo, artist*Toledo, artist*Downs, singer*Castilla, Major League Baseball Player*Gil, Major League Baseball Player*Alcal composer*Yvonne Lopez Ayuso, singer*Sabina, shamanEducationImage:Rectoria, Universidad Autnoma Benito Jurez de Oaxaca.jpg|right|thumb|One of the main buildings on the campus of the Autnoma Benito Jurez de OaxacaIn terms of institutions of higher education Oaxaca has several universities. Oaxaca is the site of the Autnoma Benito Jurez de Oaxaca, which has buildings in various parts of the city. The most visible building is the Edificio Central de la Universidad (Central Building of the University), which is located in the historic downtown. It is in a building that originally housed the Sciences Institute. It was constructed between 1899 and 1901, in the European Romantic style that was popular for academic institutions at that time. However, indigenous touches, such as the cresting over the portal, can be seen as well. This building houses the Department of Law and Social Studies as well as the gymnasium.(  Additionally, the de Mesoamrica has locations in the city. The Anhuac Oaxaca was opened in 2000.TransportationOaxaca-Xoxocotlan airport (IATA code OAX) is approximately 7 km south of the city centre. Most flights are to City for onward connection, but there are also flights to Huatulco, Cancn, Gutierrez and Tijuana. Airlines flights between Oaxaca and Houston have also been initiated.The city has separate first class and second class bus stations, offering services to most places within the state of Oaxaca, including the coastal resorts of Huatulco, Puerto Escondido, ngel and Nacional, and also long-distance services to Puebla and City and other Mexican locations such as Veracruz. There are several bus lines which run in Oaxaca. The largest is TUSUG, a type of cooperative company. All of the drivers own their own buses and are aided by other drivers in purchasing new buses.The major highways serving Oaxaca are Federal Highways 175 and 131, southwards to the Oaxacan coastal resorts; National Highways 190 and 125, southwest to Nacional; National Highways 190 and 130, to Mexico City; the autopista 150D/131D, offering a more rapid route to Mexico City; and National Highway 175 north to Veracruz, Veracruz.Surrounding townsA number of small towns surround the main city and are closely linked economically and culturally with the main city. Some of these towns are known for producing certain crafts that are identified with the three central valleys of Oaxaca. In these towns one can see the workshops and the crafts being produced in the traditional manner although most of these towns products are sold in the main city.  Mara Atzompa produces glazed, glass-inlaid pottery of green, while Antonio Arrazola and Martn Tilcajete make alebrijes, small painted wooden figures. Bartolo Coyotepec is known for its negro pottery, and del Valle works with wool and llama to make tapetes, or more commonly, throw rugs. These rugs are known for their intense colors, made traditionally with dyes, made from cempaschil (yellow), cochineal (red) and indigo (blue). In addition, Oaxaca city and surrounding towns have market days, where one can visit the tianguis (open-air markets) set up for that day. There are markets on each day of the week. Monday in Miahuatlan is for buying daily staples, and Tuesday, in Ayoquezco is noted for wood furniture. On Wednesday, people head to Etla and Zimatln for dairy products, especially cheese. Thursday is reserved for the two largest tianguis in Ejutla and de Zaachila. On Friday, in Coyotepec, Jalietza and Ocotln cotton textiles, embroidered blouses, corn-husk flowers and glazed pottery from Atzompa are sold. Also Llano park in Oaxaca has a small market. Saturday is reserved for the main city of Oaxaca, and to finish, on Sunday mezcal is sold in Tlacolula.(Municipality of OaxacaAs municipal seat, Oaxaca city has governmental jurisdiction over the following communities:Arbolada Ilusin, Camino a San Luis Beltrn, Camino Ancho, Casas del Sol, Colonia Buena Vista, El Bajo (Rancho Guadalupe Victoria), El Silencio, Entrada de el Silencio, Gloria Antonio Cruz, Guadalupe Victoria, Guadalupe Victoria Segunda Seccin (La Mina), Lachigulera, Las Salinas (El Arco Grande), Loma Bonita, Lomas Panormicas, Los ngeles, Los ngeles Uno, Miravalle, Paraje Caballetiyo, Paraje el Cerrito, Paraje el Pando, Paraje la Canoa, Paraje la Loma, Paraje la Mina, Paraje la Rabonera, Paraje Pio V (Ojito de Agua), Paraje Tierra Colorada, Pueblo Nuevo Parte Alta, Rancho el Chilar, Rancho los Girasoles, San Bernardo, Solidaridad, and Viguera  The municipality has  a total area of 85.48 km2( and a population of 265,006, 97% percent of which lives in the city of Oaxaca()  While much of the indigenous population disappeared during the colonial era, sixteen different ethnic groups continue to inhabit the municipality.

Michoacn
dollars, being a dollar worth 12.80 pesos (value of June 3, 2010).()Michoacn () officially Estado Libre y Soberano de Michoacn de Ocampo () is one of the 31 states which, with the Federal District, comprise the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided in 113 municipalities and its capital city is Morelia (formerly called Valladolid). The city was named after Mara Morelos, hero of the War of Independence.Michoacn is located in Mexico. It is bordered by the states of Colima and Jalisco to the northwest, Guanajuato and Quertaro to the north, Mxico to the east, Guerrero to the southeast. To the southwest, Michoacn has a stretch of coastline on the Ocean.The name Michoacn is from Nahuatl Michhuahkan from michhuah (possessor of fish) and -kan (place of) and means place of the fishermen referring to those who fish on Ptzcuaro.() In pre-Hispanic times, the area was the home of the Purhpecha Empire, which rivaled the Empire when the Spanish arrived. After the Spanish conquest, the empire soon became a separate province which became smaller over the colonial period. The state and several of its residents played a major role in the War of Independence. Today, the state is still home to a large population of Purhpecha people as well as Otomis and Nahuas. The economy is based on agriculture, fishing, mining and some industry. The major tourism draw for the state is the Lake Ptzcuaro-Tzintzuntzan-Quiroga area, which was the center of the Purhpecha empire.HistoryAccording to the archeological evidence, there has been human habitation within the territory of the Mexican state of Michoacn for at least 10,000 years.() In the pre-Hispanic period there were a number of waves of migration into the area including the Pirinda, Nahua, Huetamo, Colima, Purhepecha and other peoples.() There are sites of formal settlements from all Mesoamerican period. Important sites include Opeo and those in Curutarn, Tepalcatepec Apatzingn, Zinapcuaro and Coalcoman. The territory has been inhabited by the Nahuas, Otomis, Matlazincas, Pirindas and Tecos as well as the Purhpecha.(The main pre-Hispanic civilization of the state is that of the Purhpecha, which was centered in the Lake Ptzcuaro area.( Before the 13th century, both Nahua and Purhpecha peoples were here, sustaining themselves by agriculture and fishing. The Purhpecha are descendents of a late arrival of Chichimecas who came from the north. At Lake Patzcuaro, they came upon people with similar cultures to their own but who were more technically and socially advanced. The formation of the Purhpecha state began in the 13th century, when these people started their own dominion at Uayameo, today Fe de la Laguna and becoming dominant over the entire Lake Patzcuaro area by the 15th century. Conquest of neighboring tribes and territories occurred between 1401 and 1450, absorbing peoples with different cultures and languages into the empire. By the late 15th century, this state rivaled that of the Aztecs, expanding their territory over much of what is now Michoacn and into part of Colima, Nayarit, Quertaro, Guanajuato, Guerrero and Jalisco. The Aztecs attempted to invade Purhpecha but were repelled. This would later cause the Purhpecha to deny the Aztecs aid in the defense of Tenochtitlan against the Spanish.((Prior to the arrival of any Spaniard in the territory, then ruler Zuanga died of smallpox, presumably carried by one of the Aztec delegations seeking military aid. He was succeeded by II. The first Spaniard to the area was de Olid. The destruction of Tenochtitlan and the promise of remaining ruler convinced Tanganxoan II to submit peacefully to Spanish rule. However, de Guzmn would renege on this agreement and kill Tanganxoan II in 1530,(()During the first years of the Conquest, Michoacan was part of the kingdom of Mexico with included the current states of Mexico, Quertaro, Hidalgo, Tlaxcala, Oaxaca, Morelos, Guerrero, Veracruz, Tabasco, Michoacan, Guanajuato and parts of Luis Potos, Jalisco and Colima. These lands were divided into encomiendas among the conquistadors. The provinces with the largest populations were called Alcaldias Mayores, with Michoacan being one of these, with its capital initially at Tzintzuntzan. Soon after, it was moved to Patzcuaro and eventually settled in what is now Morelia. The provincial and later state capital was founded by viceroy de Mendoza in 1541. It became the political and ecclesiastical center of the province after the death of de Quiroga.(Soon after the Conquest, evangelists from the Franciscan, Augustinian, Carmelite and other orders established monasteries all over the territory. Some of the best known of these include de Moya, de la Corua and Daciano. As first governor, Nuo de Guzman would devastate the social and economic order of the area. Vasco de Quirga succeeded Guzman, bringing Franciscan and Augustinian friars to both evangelize and repair the areas broken economy and social institutions. Quiroga founded the Spanish city of Patzcuaro in 1538, calling it the Ciudad de Mechuacn.( For his efforts, Quiroga is still referred to in the Patzcuaro area as Tata (grandfather) Vasco.(  The diocese of Michoacn was established in 1536 by Paul III and its boundaries coincide with the old Purhepecha kingdom. Its first bishop was Vasco de Quiroga.()From the 16th to the 18th century, Augustinian, Franciscan and Carmelite monasteries were constructed in the territory as well as civil constructions, especially in the city now known as Morelia. Mining in areas such as Angangueo, Tlalpujahua and Inguaran was begun as well as the establishment of agricultural and livestock haciendas. The first school of higher education, called the Primera Casa de Altos Estudios en Amrica, was founded by Alonso de la Veracruz in Tiripeto.(  Michoacan was made a separate province from Mexico in 1602. By the mid 17th century, the indigenous population of the province was cut by half. In 1776, the territory of Michoacan was reduced to the area in which the modern states of Michoacan and Colima are now. Soon after, Colima split to join with the province of Guadalajara, leaving Michoacan roughly with the territory it has today.(During the entire colonial period, the economy was concentrated in the hands of the Spanish-born who held vast lands and haciendas. They also held the rights over minerals mined in places such as Tlalpujahua, Angangueo and Huetamo. Indigenous peoples were exploited for their work and slavery was not uncommon. Education was restricted only for those born in Spain and their descendents, and was controlled by the Church. The main educational institutions were the Colegio de San Nicolas, founded in the 16th century and the Seminary of San Pedro and San Pablo, founded in the 18th century. These schools produced a number of distinguished men, but the best known of these is Hidalgo y Costilla.(At the end of the 18th century, Enlightenment ideas from Europe began to infiltrate the upper classes of the state, especially in Valladolid (Morelia) and Zamora. These would eventually lead to the War of Independence in the early 19th century.() This war was foreshadowed by the 1809 conspiracy in Valladolid.(One of the early and main protagonists of the war, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, was educated as a priest in the state and began to disseminate Enlightenment ideas here. Soon after Hidalgo performed the de Dolores in Guanajuato, a number of people influence by his thought took up arms against the colonial government. These included de la Torre Lloreda, Bocanegra, Mara Garcia Obeso and Lpez Rayn. During his campaign, Hidalgo returned to Valladolid, issuing a decree eliminating slavery.(After Hidalgos death, much of the insurgent government was located in Michoacan, with documents such as Primera Constitucin o Decreto Constitucional para la Libertad de la Amrica Mexicana (First Constitution or Constitutional Decree for the Liberty of the Mexican America) and Sentimentos de la Nacion, both of which would shape constitutions and governments in the years to come. The first Mexican Supreme Court was also founded here. The Mexican War of Independence was culminated by the army of de Iturbide, also a Michoacan native, who took Morelia in May 1821.(After the war ended in 1821, the territory of Michoacan became the Free and Sovereign State of Michoacn on 31 January 1824.(  This state was initially divided into 4 departments and 22 portions (partidos) under the Ley Territorial of 1825, with the first constitution ratified in the same year. The name of the capital was changed from Valladolid to Morelia at the same time.(In 1831, the state was reorganized into 61 municipalities and 207 locales (tenencias). Due to the struggle between centralists and federalists in Mexico in the 19th century, Michoacans rights as an entity would change depending on who was in control. The state was declared a department in 1836 but became a more independent state again in 1846. Colima broke off from Michoacn to form its own state in this year. In 1849, the municipality of Coyuca was separated to form the state of Guerrero. In 1853, the state became a department again, regaining state status in 1856. In 1857, the municipality of Contepec separated to join the state of Guanajuato.( Along with the loss of political territory, by 1863, the original diocese has shrunk but it was also elevated to archdiocese.(During the Intervention in Mexico, Morelia was taken by French forces in 1863.Since resistance to the French was particularly strong here, punitive acts were undertaken by the French in places like Zitcuaro, where much of the city was burned . One of first victories that would get the French out of Mexico occurred in Zamora.(In 1907, Michoacans boundaries changed again with the addition of the communities of Pungarabato and Zirandaro added from Guerrero state to make the River a natural border.(The Revolution came to Michoacan in 1911, when those loyal to I. Madero proclaimed Clara del Cobre as their territory, then went on to take towns around Lake Patzcuaro under the leadership of Escalante. This caused the then governor of the state, Aristeo Mendoza, to resign. Fighting among various factions would continue in parts of the state for the rest of the war. The states current constitution was ratified in 1918.(In 1920, the Michoacana de San Nicols de Hidalgo was founded.(Soon after the end of the Revolution, the War would affect the state, which affected agricultural production and distribution. In 1926, hostilities would close the seminaries in Morelia and Zamora. Near the end of the war, Crdenas was elected governor of the state and served until 1932, when he became president of Mexico.(Geography, climate and natureThe state is located in the center west of the Mexican Republic, on the extreme southwest of the central highlands. It borders the states of Mexico, Quertaro, Guerrero, Guanajuato, Jalisco and Colima, with a 217 km coastline on the Pacific Ocean. The state has a territory of 58,836.95 km2, making it the sixth largest in Mexico. In addition, it also has 1490 km2 of marine territory off its Pacific coast.(()The state is crossed by the Madre del Sur, the Volcanic Belt and the Inter-mountain Valleys region. The Sierra Madre del Sur crosses the state northwest to southeast for approximately 200 km in the southwest between the municipalities of Chinicuila and Arteaga along the Pacific Coast. It is considered to be a continuation of the Madre Occidental. Peaks in this range average about 2,900masl, with the largest being the Cerro de las Canoas. The Mexican Trans Volcanic Belt crosses the state from west to east  toward the Valley and of Mexico. This mountain range is marked by appearance of many volcanoes, active, dormant, and extinct alike. This system is subdivided into regions such as the Sierra de Tanctaro, Sierra de Periban, Sierra de San Angel and others. The best known volcano in this region is the Paricutn volcano.(The state has a considerable natural system of waterways, including parts of two of the countrys largest rivers, the Lerma  and the Balsas. These waterways are divided into three regions, called the North, Central and South.  The North region includes the Lerma Basin.  On the Lerma River is the Tepuxtepec Dam which has a capacity of 371 million m3. Rivers that empty in to the Lerma in Michoacan include the Tlalpuhahua, Cachivi and Duero.  Another river basin here is that of Cuitzeo Lake, which extends over an area of 3,618 m2. The two main rivers that feed this lake are the Grande de Morelia and Querndaro.(The Central region is represented by Patzcuaro and  Zirahun Lakes. Patzcuaro Lake has a surface area of 1,525 km2. This lake is fed by a number of surface and subterranean water flows with the principal rivers leading here including the San Gregorio and Chapultepec. This lake has five islands within it called Janitzio, Yunun, La Pacanda, Tecun, Jarcuaro, Urandn and Carin. Zirahun Lake has an area of 615 km2 and is fed by streams such as Manzanilla and Zinamba. These two lakes are considered to be the main tourist attraction of the state.(Most of the states rivers and streams are located in the South region of the state, with the Balsas River being the most important. The most important tributaries of this river include the Cutzamala, Carcuaro and Tepalcatepec rivers. Within this region is the coastal watershed, which is the area between the Sierra Madre del Sur and the coastline. This area includes small rivers such as the Coahuayana, Aquila, Ostula, Motn del Oro, Coire, Cachn and Nexpa which flow directly into the Pacific.(Much of the climate of the state is determined by altitude and other geographical features. Average temperatures vary from 13 C to 29 C. Lower temperatures correspond with the highland areas in the north and east which the lower south and west, called La Costa (the coast) or Tierra Caliente (hot lands) register the higher temperatures. In the hotter lowlands, high temperatures regularly exceed 30 C and have been known to reach over 40 C in the summer. The lowest temperatures are registered highlands areas such as the Sierra de Coalcoman and the Sierra del Centro located near the border with the State of Mexico. Except for the Tierra Caliente, most of the state can experience freezing temperatures in the winter. Rainfall is also dependent on altitude with the lowlands receiving less rain than the mountain areas. There is a well-defined rainy season which extends from June to October over the entire state.(Ecosystems vary by altitude. Between 2600 and 3500 masl, most of the vegetation is conifer forests. Between 1000 and 2600, there are mixed forests and below this is broadleaf or tropical forests. There are some areas which are grassland, mostly located in the north and northeast of the state. Animal types vary from region to region but among mammals can be found skunks, raccoons, cacomixtle, rabbits, armadillos, mountain lions, and foxes. Numerous bird species can be found including water fowl such as ducks, storks and seabirds along the coast. Reptiles, amphibians and fish can be found in the waterways and along the coast.(EconomyFile:Puerto Lzaro Crdenas.jpg|thumb|Cargo ship at the Cardenas portThe economy of the state is based on agriculture, livestock, forest products, fishing and crafts.(  Most of the population is employed in three sectors, agriculture (34%), mining and manufacturing(23%) and commerce(37%). Agriculture occupies over a million hectares of land in the state or 20%. Three fifths of this agriculture occurs only during the rainy season. Irrigation farming is restricted to areas such as the Valley, the Bajo are of Michoacan, the Valley and some others. Principal crops include corn, sorghum, avocados, strawberries, peaches, wheat, limes, sugar cane and mangos. While corn accounts for 43% of the crops harvested, Michoacan is the largest producer of avocados in Mexico and in the world. Forty three percent of farmland in the territory is dedicated to the raising of livestock including cattle, domestic fowl, sheep, goats and pigs. In 2007, the states production of meat, dairy and eggs was valued at over four billion pesos.()Sixty percent of the state is covered in forest, with the most economically important of these located in the higher elevations at the eastern side.(economa)  These forests mostly produce lumber and resin. These areas are estimated at 2,160,000 hectares, over half of which is pine forest. The most productive forest is located in the central and eastern portions of the state. Rainforest areas are estimated at 460,500 hectares. However, one problem facing the forested areas of the state is unsustainable logging. In addition to exploitable forest, there is also ecological reserves with tourist important, especially the various monarch butterfly sanctuaries in the extreme east of the state.(Michoacns lakes, rivers and coastline make it an important producer of fish and seafood, both caught in the wild and farmed. The most important commercial fishing is for tilapia and carp.(Mining is an important economic activity in the state, which is mostly concentrated on the eastern side near the Mexico State border.  However, iron is mined in the Lzaro Crdenas area near the coast. Both metallic and non-metallic minerals are mined in the state. These include iron, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead, silver, gold, fill dirt, sand, gravel, lime, limestone, marble, and others. There are thirteen principal mining areas, Tlalpujahua, Angangueo, Los Azufres, Real de Otzumatln, Tzitzio, Timaro, El Bastn, San Diego Curucupaco, Inguarn, Las Truchas and La Minita de Coalcomn. Michoacn is the second largest producer of coke and third largest producer of iron, which are essential to the steel industry in Mexico. While there remains significant metallic deposits, their mining only contributes 1.64% to the economy.((Most industrial activity is concentrated in the central region of the state, near the capital, where are located a number of industrial parks such as Ciudad Industrial Morelia. However. there are other areas with industry, such as Apatzingn, Zamora, Jiquilpan and Sahuayo as well as in the Lzaro Crdenas area. Major production areas are iron and steel (34.27%), bottling (10.43%) and paper products (8.36%).(Most people in the state are employed in service and commerce, and this sector contributes 19.07% to the overall economy. Most sales are in foodstuffs, drinks and tobacco. The state contains a large number of potential attractions, most of which are classified as suitable for ecotourism. However, only 6.2 of these sites are visited by international tourists. Most visitors to sites are from within the state.(InfrastructureThe state contains more than 12,804 km of federal, state and local roads. Major highways in the state include Federal Highway 15 and the Morelia-Patzcuaro highway.  Intercity and interstate buses provide connections to places with in the state and the rest of Mexico. 99% of these bus lines are second class while just under nine percent are first class. Most rail lines are limited to the north and center of the state, providing freight service to Mexico City and Guadalajara. The states main port is the city of Lzaro Crdenas with contains 2,926 meters of dock space. The dock is mostly used for the shipping of minerals and grains.()() There are two major airports, an international one in Morelia and a national one in Uruapan. Smaller facilities exist in Zamora and Lzaro Crdenas. The state has abundance hydroelectrical produccion due to dams on the Balsas River, the Lerma River and the Tepalcatepec River.( As of 1995, the state had eight television stations, with seven out of operations. There is a system of educational television with 528 broadcast antennas.(EducationThe state provides public education from preschool level to high school.  Formal preschool is offered in communities which have twenty five or more qualified students. Less formal preschools are operated in smaller communities. As of 1996, there were 5433 primary schools serving 705,694 students with 25,485 teachers. There is a relatively high failure rate from grade to grade of about 9.7% with just under five percent leaving school permanently before finishing primary studies. The most common reason for this is poverty. At the secondary level there are 174,354 students, which represent only 122% of these eligible to attend. High school level studies are mostly geared to vocational studies and many attend via distance education. There are 24 public and private institutions of higher learning offering 49 different majors. Eight are technical colleges, four for teachers, the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicols de Hidalgo, the Instituto Michoacano de Ciencias de la Educacin and ten private institutions.(The Universidad Michoacan de San Nicols de Hidalgo began as the Colegio de San Nicolas Obispo, founded by Vasco de Quiroga in Patzcuaro in 1540. It was originally a seminary for the training of evangelists. It was granted a royal seal in 1543 to become the Real Colegio de San Nicols Obispo. The school was moved to Morelia in 1580 and was fused with the Colegio de San Miguel Guayangareo. In 1590, its name was changed to the Seminario Tridentino, when the Seminario Conciliar in 1601. By the end of the 17th century, the name returned to Colegio de San Nicols but its structure was profoundly changed, adding studies such as philosophy and others, civil law and others. At the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, a number of figures associated with the Mexican War of Independence, such as Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Jos Mara Morelos and others were associated with this school. By the mid 19th century, the school had been secularized and renamed the Primitivo y Nacional Colegio de San Nicols de Hidalgo adding studies such as chemistry, physics and other sciences. The current name and organization was adopted after the Mexican Revolution in 1917.()Tourismde las Artesanas de Michoacn 001.jpg|thumb|Casa de las Artesanas in the historic district of MoreliaThe state ministry of tourism has divided the state into regions, mostly base on the major cities of Morelia, Uruapan, Lazaro Cardenas, Patzcuaro, Zamora and Zitcuaro.()The Morelia region stresses its cultural and artistic heritage, especially its colonial architecture . The most important colonial structures are in Morelia and built in the 18th century. These include the cathedral, finished in 1744 and the main aqueduct finished at the end of the century. This architecture has made the city a Heritage Site. In addition to the state capital, the region includes towns such as Charo, Capula, Tiripetio, Cuitzeo and Huandacareo, which contain archeological sites, water parks and traditional cuisine. The rural areas of this zone contain more than 400 thermal springs, many of which have been turned into recreational areas and parks.  These include Reino de Atzimba, Cointzio, Huandacareo and El Ejido.()The Uruapan region stresses its cultural and natural heritage. The city is one of the oldest settlements in the state, which was initially settled by the Meseta Purhepecha. This city contains a number of attractions such as La Huatpera, colonial era hospital founded by Vasco de Quiroga, the Temple of San Francisco and the Eduardo Ruiz Municipal Museum. One other attraction is the narrowest house in the world as documented by the Book of World Records. Other important cities in the region are Apatzingn and Caracha.()Uruapan is surrounded by hundreds of hectares of forests and by fertile fields growing fruits and flowers, many of which only grow here. Some of the natural attractions of the zone include the Santa Catarina Dam and the La Tzaracua and La Tzararacuita waterfalls. Smaller towns and villages in this region are known for their religious and popular festivals, many of which occur in the summer. Examples of these are the feasts of Seor del Calvario in Quinceo, of San Mateo Ahuiran in Paracho and the National Guitar Festival in  Paracho. The best known town in the region is San Juan Nuevo Parangaricutiro, which was founded due to the destruction of its original namesake by the eruption of the Paricutn volcano.(The pre-Hispanic sites of Tingambato and Taretan are in this zone as well, which were important Purhepecha cities.(The Lzaro Crdenas region is named after Michoacn largest port and oceanside city. Here the state stresses the miles of beaches and other natural areas in which to practice ecotourism and extreme sports. Beaches include Maruata, Faro de Buceras, the Pichi Estuary, La Laguna de Mezcala, La Ticla and Nexpa, with the last two considered suitable for surfing with their regular two-three meter waves. A number of these beaches are protected areas due to the fact that they are breeding ground for sea turtles.()The Patzcuaro region is extremely important to the state due to its history of having been the center of the Purhepecha Empire as well as the first capital of the colonial province of Michoacan. Its pre-Hispanic heritage is evident by the Tzintzuntzan and Ihuatizo sites as well as the large number of people who still speak the Purhepecha language and maintain pre-Hispanic customs. Vasco de Quiroga established the first capital at Patzcuaro and was instrumental to building the colonial era economy of the Lake Patzcuaro area. The lake is surrounded by mountains and forests as well as the towns of Cuanajo, Tuptaro, Erongucuaro and Quiroga. These towns are noted for their crafts and popular religious festivals such as the feast of the Seor del Rescate in Tzintzuntzan, Holy Week and especially Noche de Muertos or Night of the Dead. This are is the most important to the state with the most visited town, Patzcuaro with its basilica and museums.()One of the largest tourist events in the state is Noche de Muertos or Night of the Dead. This is celebrated on the dates around 2 November. Essentially, these are of the Dead celebrations, which are celebrated all over Mexico, but with unique variations. The events of these days show a blending of both pre-Hispanic and Catholic beliefs and traditions. Noche de Muertos is celebrated most strongly in the towns and villages around Lake Patzcuaro such as Tzintzuntzan, Ihuatzio, as well as Patzuaro itself, which was the center of the Purhepecha Empire.  As in other parts of Mexico, altars to the dead, both in homes and on graves are erected and covered with offerings such as bread, fruit and other items. One aspect which is unique to the event here is the lighting and floating of hundreds of small candles and flowers on Lake Patzcuaro on the night between 1 and 2 November. It is also believed that on this night the souls of Mintzita, the daughter of Purhepecha kind Tzintzicha and Itzihuapa, son  of Tar rise. Theirs is a Romeo and Juliet storyas they were never able to marry due to the Spanish invasion of their lands. Today, it is said that the two rise up and head toward a specific cemetery to receive visitors. There are a number of other rituals performed on these days such as the Terescuan y Campaneri a kind of treasure hunt for hidden harvest items.()The Zamora region is center of the city of the same name in an area known as the Meseta Purpecha or Purhepecha Mesa. Pre-Hispanic language and customs are preserved here as well as well as a large number of crafts such s the pottery of Ptamban and the embroidery of Tarecuato. The region is part of an area of Mexico known as the Bajo and has extensive agriculture, livestock and some industry. Regional dishes such as pigs feet, breads baked in wood fired ovens, tamales, pozole and dishes made with avocados and corn are promoted here. Important towns outside of Zamora include Camcuaro, Orandiro, La Estancia and La Alberca. The city of Zamora is home to one of the oldest cultures  in the west of Mexico which dates to about 1750 BCE, known as the Opeo.  The Spanish city was founded as a military garrison.()The Zitacuaro region contains approximately a half million hectares of conifer forests, but is best known as being part of the wintering grounds of the butterfly. The area is filled with old mining towns as well as an important archeological site. The region is home to the Mazahua and Otomi peoples, many of whom produce crafts such as blankets, rebozos and ceramics. The city of Zitacuaro is the site of an important battle during the French Intervention in Mexico, which gives it the title of Heroic City. Other important communities include Agangueo, San Matias and Ciudad Hidalgo. The most important places to see monarch butterflies in the winder are in municipalities of Angangeo and Ocampo. The butterfly sanctuaries are called El Rosario, Cerro Campanario, Sierra Chincua and El Llanno de las Papas.()DemographicsMichoacan is the seventh most populated state in Mexico and the average resident has a life expectancy of 73.3 years. It is estimated that each year about 40,000 people immigrate to the state while 78,000 leave, leading to population loss. Of those who leave, about one third go the other places in Mexico and the rest to other countries, principally the United States. The cities with the densest populations are Morelia, Uruapan and Zamora.()The indigenous population is estimated at just over seven percent of the total, with most living in 29 municipalities.  Most are  Purhepcha, which are located in the Meseta-Caada, Patzcuaro Lake, Zirahun Lake, and Zacapu regions. In the east of the state, in the municipalities of Ocampo, Anguangueo, Tuxpan, Hidalgo, Maravato and Zitcuaro, there is a mix of Mazahua, Otomi and Purhepecha. On the coast can be found the Aquila, Chinicuila and Coahuayana peoples.( Municipalities There are 113 Municipalities.

German_East_Africa
 today  German East Africa () was a German colony in East Africa, which included what are now :Burundi, :Rwanda and Tanganyika (the mainland part of present Tanzania). Its area was , nearly three times the size of Germany today.The colony came into existence during the 1880s and ended with Imperial Germanys defeat in World War I. Afterwards the territory was divided between Britain and Belgium, and was later converted to a mandate of the League of Nations. History The colony began with Peters, an adventurer who founded the for German Colonization and signed treaties with several native chieftains on the mainland opposite Zanzibar. On 3 March 1885, the German government announced it had granted an imperial charter (issued on 17 February) to Peters company and intended to establish a protectorate in East Africa. Peters then recruited specialists who began exploring south to the River and north to Witu, near Lamu on the coast.When the Sultan of Zanzibar protested, since he claimed to be ruler on the mainland as well, Bismarck sent five warships, which arrived on 7 August and trained their guns on the Sultans palace. The British and Germans agreed to divide the mainland between themselves, and the Sultan had no option but to agree.German rule was quickly established over Bagamoyo, es Salaam, and Kilwa, even sending the caravans of Prince, Langheld, Emin Pasha, Charles Stokes to dominate the Street of Caravans. The Revolt of 1888 and was put down (with British help) the following year. In 1890, London and Berlin concluded the Treaty, returning Heligoland (seized during the Napoleonic wars) to Germany and deciding on the borders of German East Africa (the exact boundaries remained unsurveyed until 1910).Between 1891 and 1894, the Hehe tribe, led by Mkwawa, resisted German expansion. They were defeated as rival tribes supported the Germans. After years of guerrilla warfare, Mkwawa himself was cornered and committed suicide in 1898.The Maji Rebellion occurred in 1905 and was put down by the governor, Count Adolf von Gtzen. But scandal soon followed, with stories of corruption and brutality, and in 1907 Chancellor Blow appointed Dernburg to reform the colonial administration. It became a model of colonial efficiency and commanded extraordinary loyalty among the natives during the First World War.German colonial administrators relied heavily on native chiefs to keep order and collect taxes. By 1 January 1914, aside from local police, military garrisons of Schutztruppen (protective troops) at Dar es Salaam, Moshi, Iringa, and Mahenge comprised 110 German officers (including 42 medical officers), 126 non-commissioned officers, and 2,472 native enlisted men (Askaris(Originally an Arabic word for soldier adopted from Osmanli, i.e. Ottoman Turkish, then applied to indigenous African troops in European colonies.)).(Haupt, Deutschlands Schutzgebiete in bersee 18841918, p. 32)(SS-Oberfhrer Scherner was born here in Bagamoyo in 1895.)Economic developmentCommerce and growth started in earnest under German direction. Early on it was realized that economic development would depend on reliable transportation. Over  were under sisal cultivation  the biggest cash crop. Two million coffee trees were planted and rubber trees grew on 200,000 acres (80,000 hectares ), along with large cotton plantations. To bring these agricultural products to market, beginning in 1888, the Railway, or Northern Railroad, was built from Tanga to Moshi. The longest line, the Central Railroad covered  from Dar es Salaam to Morogoro, Tabora and Kigoma. The final link to the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika had been completed in July 1914 and was cause for a huge and festive celebration in the capital with an agricultural fair and trade exhibition. Harbor facilities were built or improved with electrical cranes, with rail access and warehouses. Wharves were remodeled at Tanga, Bagamoyo and Lindi. In 1912 Dar es Salaam and Tanga received 356 freighters and passenger steamers and over 1,000 coastal ships and local trading vessels.(Haupt, p. 30) By 1914 Dar es Salaam and the surrounding province had a population of 166,000, among them 10,490(1,050 Europeans, 1,000 of them Germans. In all of the east African protectorate were 3,579 Germans.(Haupt, p. 155) In its own right, Dar es Salaam became the showcase city of all of tropical Africa.(Miller, Battle for the Bundu, p. 22)Gold mining in Tanzania in modern times dates back to the German colonial period, beginning with gold discoveries near Victoria in 1894. The first gold mine in the colony was the Gold Mine, which began operation in 1909 after gold was found there in 1907.(Tanzania Mining History tanzaniagold.com, accessed: 24 July 2010)Despite all these efforts, German East Africa never achieved a profit for the Empire and needed to be subsidized by the Berlin treasury.EducationUnlike the Belgian, British, French and Portuguese colonial masters in central Africa, Germany developed an educational program for Africans that involved elementary, secondary and vocational schools. Instructor qualifications, curricula, textbooks, teaching materials, all met standards unmatched anywhere in tropical Africa.(Miller, p. 21) In 1924, ten years after the beginning of the First World War and six years into British rule, the visiting American Phelps-Stokes Commission reported: In regards to schools, the Germans have accomplished marvels. Some time must elapse before education attains the standard it had reached under the Germans.(One of the influences of this German development of education in their colony is the word shule (from schule in German) that means school. Since Germans were the first colonialists to establish a solid educational program in East Africa, the word shule has been borrowed into the Swahili language, the lingua franca of East Africa. First World War The story of German East Africa in the First World War is essentially the history of the colonys military commander, General Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck. A vibrant officer, he spent the war harrying the forces of the British Empire, tying down with his band of 3,500 Europeans and 12,000 native Askaris and porters, a British/Imperial army 40,000 strong, which was at times commanded by the former Boer War commander Smuts. One of his greatest victories was at the of Tanga (35 November 1914), where von Lettow-Vorbeck beat a British force more than eight times the size of his own.File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA3056, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Askarikompanie.jpg|thumb|250px|Askari company, c. 1914/18.Lettow-Vorbecks guerilla campaign compelled Britain to commit significant resources to a minor colonial theatre throughout the war and inflicted upwards of 10,000 casualties. Eventually weight of numbers, especially after forces coming from the Congo had attacked from the West, and dwindling supplies forced Lettow-Vorbeck to abandon the colony. He withdrew into Mozambique, then into Rhodesia where he agreed a ceasefire three days after the end of the war, on receiving news of the armistice between the warring nations (see Lettow-Vorbeck Memorial for details.)Lettow-Vorbeck was acclaimed after the war as one of Germanys heroes, and his Schutztruppe was celebrated as the only colonial German force in the First World War not to have been defeated in open combat (although they often retreated when outnumbered). The Askari colonial troops that had fought in the East African campaign were later given pension payments by the Republic and the Republic of Germany (West Germany).The German cruiser SMS Knigsberg also fought off the coast of East Africa. She was eventually scuttled in the Rufiji delta in July 1915 after running low on coal and spare parts, and was subsequently blockaded and bombarded by the British.  The surviving crew stripped out the remaining ships guns and mounted them on trunnions, before joining the land forces, adding considerably to their effectiveness.A smaller, though no less fascinating, campaign was conducted on the shores of southern Tanganyika over 191415. This involved a make shift British and Belgian flotilla, and the Reichsheer garrison at Bismarckburg (modern day Kasanga).The of Versailles broke up the colony, giving the north-western area to Belgium as Ruanda-Urundi, the small Triangle south of the River to Portugal to become part of Mozambique, and the remainder to Britain, which named it Tanganyika.CoinageEast African rupieGerman place-names* Bismarckburg (Kasanga)* Kilimandscharo (Kilimanjaro)* Wilhelmstal (Lushoto)* Weidmannsheil (Tabora)* Neu Langenburg (Tukuyu)* Neu Gottorp (Uvinza)See also* of colonial heads of Tanganyika* of former German colonies* East Africa Company* South-West Africa* German Kamerun* Togoland* of NamibiaFootnotes(References and external links* The coins and bank notes of German East Africa* Schnee, Dr. Heinrich (Deputy Governor of German Samoa and last Governor of German East Africa), German Colonization, Past and Future  The Truth about the German Colonies, Allen & Unwin, London, 1926.* Bullock, A.L.C., Germanys Colonial Demands, University Press, 1939.* Wikified article on German East Africa based on the 1911 edition of Encyclopdia Britannica* East, John William.

Nevertheless, Eastern Karelian is not completely mutually intelligible with Finnish and could be considered a separate language. Finnish was the second language of Karelia from the War 1940 up until the 1980s,(http://www.helsinki-hs.net/news.asp?id20020129IE17) when perestroika began. Currently Russian is the only language of the republic, but there is a motion in the republics government to make Karelian official as well. Finnish has also again been proposed as a second official language for the republic, but the proposal has never been implemented, although Karelian, Veps and Finnish are recognized as national languages of the republic.(http://gov.karelia.ru/News/2004/03/0318_08_f.html)EconomyKarelias regional product in 2007 was 109.5 billion rubles.(The Republic of Karelia in 2007 School of Economics) This amounts to 151,210 rubles per capita, which is somewhat lower than the national average of 198,817 rubles.(         )IndustryIndustrial activity in Karelia is dominated by the forest and wood processing sector. Timber logging is carried out by a large number of small enterprises whereas pulp and paper production is concentrated in five large enterprises, which produce about a quarter of Russias total output of paper.(Regional characteristics. Republic of Karelia School of Economics) Three largest companies in the pulp and paper sector in 2001 were: Kondopoga (sales of $209.4 mln in 2001), Pulp and Paper Mill ($95.7 mln) and Pitkjaranta Pulp Factory ($23.7 mln).()In 2007, extractive industries (including extraction of metal ores) amounted to 30% of the republics industrial output.( There are about 53 mining companies in Karelia, employing more than 10,000 people.() One of the most important companies in the sector is Karelian Pellet, which is the 5h largest of Russias 25 mining and dressing enterprises involved in ore extraction and ore concentrate production. Other large companies in the sector were Karelnerud, State Unitary Enterprise and Mining Directorate State Unitary Enterprise.(Processing industries contributed 56,4% of the overal production in 2007. The latter figure includes pulp-and-paper (23.6%), metals and metal-working (7.9%), woodworking (7.1%), foodstuffs (5.8%) and machine-building (3.9%).

Water communications connect Karelia with the Barents, Baltic, Black and Seas through the system of rivers, lakes and canals. Federal railway (see Railway) and automobile highways cross Karelia and connect Murmansk Region and Murmansk sea port with Petersburg, Moscow, the center of Russia and with Finland. Regular airline service connects Petrozavodsk with Joensuu and Helsinki in Finland.(The Republic of Karelia) A fast fibre-optic cable link connecting Finnish Kuhmo and Karelian Kostomuksha was built in 2007, providing fast telecommunications.(Foreign tradeThe Republics main export partners in 2001 were Finland (32% of total exports), Germany (7%), Netherlands (7%) and the Kingdom (6%).( Main export products were lumber (over 50%), iron ore pellets (13-15%) paper and cardboard (6-9%) and sawn timber with (5-7%). Many of Karelias companies have received investments from Finland.(HistoryHistorically, Karelia was a region to the northwest of Russia, east of present-day Finland, controlled by the Republic. From the 13th century and onwards, various parts were conquered by Sweden, and incorporated into Swedish Karelia until they were lost to Russia by the of Nystad in 1721.In 1920, the province became the Karelian Labour ommune. In 1923, the province became the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Karelian ASSR). From 1940 it was made into the SSR, incorporating the Democratic Republic which nominally operated in those parts of Finnish Karelia that were occupied by the Soviet Union during the Winter War.  Annexed territories were incorporated into Karelo-Finnish SSR, but after the War the Karelian Isthmus was incorporated into the Oblast. Its status was changed back to an ASSR in 1956. During the Continuation War in 1941 Finland occupied large parts of the area but was forced to withdraw in 1944.  Though Finland is not currently pursuing any measures to reclaim Karelian lands ceded to Russia, the Karelian Question is still a topic present in Finnish politics.The autonomous Republic of Karelia in its present form was formed on November 13, 1991.PoliticsThe highest executive authority in the Republic of Karelia is the Head of the Republic. As of 2010, the Head of the Republic is Andrey Vitalyevich Nelidov, who was elected in June 2010.The parliament of the Republic of Karelia is the Legislative Assembly comprising fifty deputies elected for a four year term.The of the Republic of Karelia was adopted on February 12, 2001.CultureFile:kem prokudin.jpg|thumb|250px|View of the old town of Kem in 1916, photograph by Prokudin-GorskyKarelia is sometimes called the songlands in the Finnish culture, as Karelian poems constitute most of the Karelo-Finnish epic Kalevala.ReligionThe Karelians have been traditionally Orthodox, known in Finland for their small chapels called tsasouna (variant spelling of Russian  chasovnya, chapel) associated with villages or graveyards.

Khama_III
Khama III (1837?-1923), also known as Khama the Good, was the kgosi (meaning chief or king) of the Bamangwato people of Bechuanaland (now Botswana), who made his country a protectorate of the Kingdom to ensure its survival against Boer and Ndebele encroachments.Ancestry and YouthDuring the 18th century, Malope, chief of the Bakwena tribe, led his people from the Transvaal region of Africa into the southeast territory of Botswana. Malope had three sons  Kwena, Ngwato, and Ngwaketse  each of whom would eventually break away from their father (as well as from each other) and form new tribes in neighboring territories. This type of familial break between father and sons (and then between sons) was historically how tribes proliferated throughout the southern African region. Splitting off and then reforming was not an uncommon occurrence among tribes.In this particular instance, the break between Malope and sons was precipitated by a series of events  the death of Malope, Kwenas subsequent assumption of the Bakwena chieftanship (as the eldest son of any African tribe customarily does), and ultimately a dispute between Kwena and Ngwato over a lost cow. Shortly after the lost-cow incident, Ngwato and his followers secretly left Kwenas village under the cover of darkness and established a new village to the north. Ngwaketse similarly moved south.Unfortunately for Ngwato, out of Kwenas sight was not necessarily out of his mind. Kwena warriors attacked Ngwatos village three times, each time pushing Ngwato and his tribe of followers (now known as the Bamangwato) further northward. Somehow (this episode is not explained by Bessie), they held on, and by the time of Chief Khama IIIs reign (between the years 18751923), the Bamangwato had grown (both through natural population increase and the influx of refugee tribes from the South Africa and Rhodesia) to become the regions largest tribe.Khama III (or Khama the Great as he was more affectionately known) is perhaps Botswanas most memorable chief. At a young age he made bold decisions governing how he would live his personal life; decisions that would later transform tribal custom in quite substantial ways.Baptism and Conflict with SekgomaIn his early twenties, Khama was baptized into the church via the Missionary Society (LMS) along with five of his younger brothers. The brothers were some of the first members of the tribe to take this step; a step that would soon be joined by a fairly large percentage of Khamas followers. It was no small step for Khama. By this time in his life he had already gone through bogwera (the tribes traditional initiation ceremony into manhood) with members of his mephato (age regiment). Historically, bogwera entailed rigorous endurance tests, which included circumcision. The ceremony culminated in the ritual slaying of one of the mephatos members as a kind of purification rite.Initially, Khamas father, Chief Sekgoma I, grudgingly accepted his sons affiliation with the church, although he did not embrace church doctrine himself. Eventually their divergent beliefs and values brought Sekgoma and Khama into open conflict. At the time, the tribe was based in the village of Shoshong, which is located near present-day Mahalapye.The conflict included its share of intrigue  an attempted assassination (of Khama by Sekgoma), Khamas marriage to a Christian woman named Mma Bessie and his subsequent refusal to take a second wife according to the custom of polygamy, Khamas withstanding of Sekgomas sorcery, Khamas forced exile with the tribes Christian followers into the hills surrounding the village of Shoshong, and finally Khamas return to Shoshong after Sekgomas second botched assassination attempt and the concomitant installing of Sekgomas brother, Macheng, as the new chief of the beleaguered tribe (Sekgoma headed into exile).It was not long before Macheng and Khama clashed as well, leading Macheng to attempt his own assassination of Khama, which likewise failed miserably. Khama then ousted Macheng and, in what was either a selfless gesture of goodwill or simply a dogged adherence to tribal custom, re-installed his father, Sekgoma, as Chief of the Bamangwato. Unfortunately, the truce between father and son would again falter after a few short months.This time Khama and his followers, who now represented the majority of the tribe in Shoshong, relocated northward to the tiny village of Serowe and prepared for war with Sekgoma. The war lasted one month, culminating in Sekgomas defeat and Khamas ascension of the chieftainship. Khama was now free to leave his mark on the history of the tribe.ChieftainshipKhama was a charismatic leader, to say the least. He is probably best remembered for having made three crucial decisions during his tenure as chief. First, although he abolished the bogwera ceremony itself, Khama retained the mephato regiments as a source of free labor to build missionary schools and churches. The scope of a mephatos work responsibilities would later expand considerably under the rule of Khamas son Tshekedi into the building of primary schools, grain silos, water reticulation systems, and even a college named Moeng located on the outskirts of Serowe, which under Khamas reign had become the Bamangwato capital. In concert with the mephato, Khama introduced a host of European technological improvements in Bamangwato territory, including the mogoma, or oxen-drawn moldboard plow (in place of the hand hoe) and wagons for transport (in place of sledges).In todays world the mephato might be considered an exploitative form of community self-help. The young men of Serowe were required to participate in assigned work projects when their regiments were called to service. And called they were, in the literal sense of the word. An appointed person from the village would climb to the top of Serowe Hill and literally yell out the name of the mephato that was scheduled to begin work. All members of the mephato would drop whatever they were doing and begin their six-month tour of duty, without any material support from the village (in particular without any organized contribution of food). The mephato was generally expected to fend for itself during its work assignment.After Khama became king in 1875, after overthrowing his father Sekgoma and elbowing away his brother Kgamane his ascension came at a time of great dangers and opportunities. Ndebele incursions from the north (from what is now Zimbabwe), Boer and mixed trekkers from the south, and German colonialists from the West, all hoping to the seize his territory and its hinterlands. He answered these challenges by aligning his state with the administrative aims of the British, which provided him with cover and support, and, relatedly, by energetically expanding his own control over a much wider area than any kgosi before him. Khama converted to Christianity, which moved him to criminalize sectarianism and to deprecate the institutions favored by traditionalists. At Khamas request stringent laws were passed against the importation of alcohol.The British government itself was of two minds as to what to do with the territory. One faction, supported by a local missionary named John Mackenzie, advocated the establishment of a protectorate, while another faction, headed by Rhodes, adopted an imperialist stance and demanded that the country be opened up to white settlement and economic exploitation. The resolution came in 1885, when the territory south of the River became the colony of British Bechuanaland, while the territory north of the river became the Bechuanaland Protectorate. The colony was eventually incorporated into Britains Colony and is now part of Africa.Rhodes continued his campaign to pressure the British government to annex what remained of Khamas territory. In 1895, with two other chiefs from neighboring tribes, Khama traveled to Britain to lobby of the United Kingdom for protection from the dual pressures of Cecil Rhodes British South African Company  located in what was later to become Rhodesia to the north  and the Afrikaner settlers creeping up from the south. His efforts were eventually successful and the Bechuanaland Protectorate, which was later to become the independent nation of Botswana in 1966 under the leadership of Khamas grandson Khama, was established. The colonial administration conceded after the ill-fated Raid of 1896. Had Khama been unable to convince the British authorities of the need to protect the Bamangwato, it is very likely that much of what is today Botswana would have been absorbed into Rhodesia and South Africa.Khama III was steadfast in imposing his Christianized will on the tribe. He banned alcohol from tribal lands (with varying success), put moratoriums on the sale of cattle outside the Bamangwato territory and tribal land as concessions to foreign mining and cattle interests, and abolished polygamy. The abolishment of polygamy was perhaps his most controversial move. Some argue that as Christianity later spread among the other tribes of the protectorate and polygamy was universally abolished, the societal glue that kept families together (extended as they were through polygamy) dried up.LegacyKhamas eldest son from his marriage with Mma Bessie was named II, who became chief of the Bamangwato upon Khamas death in 1923. Sekgoma IIs eldest son was named Seretse. Throughout his life Khama took several wives (each after the death of the former one). One of his wives, Semane, birthed a son named Khama.II reign lasted only a year or so, leaving his son Seretse, who at the time was an infant, as the rightful heir to the chieftainship (Tshekedi was not in line to be chief since he did not descend from Khamas oldest son Sekgoma II). So in keeping with tradition, Tshekedi acted as regent of the tribe until Seretse was old enough to assume the chieftainship. The transfer of responsibility from Khama to Khama was planned to occur after Seretse had returned from his law studies overseas in Britain.Tshekedi Khama is also best remembered for three things during his reign as acting chief of the Bamangwato  his expansion of the mephato regiments for the building of primary schools, grain silos, and water reticulation systems; his frequent confrontations with the British colonial authorities over the administration of justice in Ngwato country; and his efforts to deal with a major split in the tribe after Seretse married a white woman named Ruth while studying law in Britain.Tshekedi opposed the marriage on the grounds that under Tswana custom a chief could not marry simply as he pleased. He was a servant of the people; the chieftaincy itself was at stake. Seretse would not budge in his desire to marry Ruth (which he did while exiled in Britain in 1948), and tribal opinion about the marriage basically split evenly along demographic lines - older people went with Tshekedi, the younger with Seretse. In the end, British authorities exiled both men (Tshekedi from the Bamangwato territory, Seretse from the Protectorate altogether). Rioting broke out and a number of people were killed.Eventually, once emotions had had enough time to subside, Seretse and Ruth were allowed to return to the Protectorate and Seretse and Tshekedi were able to patch things up a bit between themselves. By now though, Khama saw his destiny not as chief of the Bamangwato tribe, but rather as leader of the Democratic Party and as President of the soon-to-be independent nation of Botswana in 1966. He would remain Botswanas President until his death from pancreatic cancer in 1980.Current descendantsThe Bechuanaland Protectorate maintained its semi-independent status until 1966, when it gained full independence as the Republic of Botswana. The first president, Sir Khama, was the grandson and heir of Khama III and his first son from Ruth Khama, Seretse Khama Ian Khama, would succeed Seretse Khama as the paramount chief of the Bamangwato and go on to become the commander of the Botswana Defense Force, as a Lieutenant General. On April 1, 2008, Khama Ian Khama, son of Sir Seretse Khama, and former of Botswana, was sworn in as the fourth of Botswana. Khama II, the brother of Khama Ian Khama, had also entered the political fray by taking over the parliamentary seat of his brother in Serowe.  Ndelu Seretse a cousin of President Seretse Khama Ian Khama is the current Minister of Justice of Defense and Security in the Government of Botswana. Khama, a distant  relative of Khama Ian Khama is the CEO of De Beers Botswana, the largest mining company in Botswana, and part of the largest mineral mining company in the world. President Seretse Khama Ian Khama was elected for a full term as President of Botswana on October 16, 2009. Hence, the House of Khama still is firmly entrenched in Botswana society for future generations to come.Publications* Mrs. Wyndham Knight-Bruce, The Story of an African Chief (London, 1894)* Edwin Lloyd, Three Great African Chiefs - Khame, Sebele, and Bathoeng (London, 1895)IIIIII

Iraqi civilian fatalities:7,269 (Iraq Body Count)(Iraq Body Count project. Source of IBC quote on undercounting by media is Press Release 15 :: Iraq Body Count.  )3,2004,300 (Project on Defense Alternatives study)(The 2003 invasion of Iraq (March 19May 1, 2003), was the start of the conflict known as the War or Operation Iraqi Freedom in which a combined force of troops from the States, the Kingdom and smaller contingents from Australia, Poland and Spain invaded Iraq and toppled the regime of Hussein in 21 days of major combat operations. This phase (MarchApril 2003) consisted of a conventionally fought war which concluded with the fall of the Iraq capital Baghdad. This was considered a continuation of the War of 1991, prior to which Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait, and after defeat by Coalition Forces had agreed to surrender and/or destroy several types of weapons, including SCUD missiles and of mass destruction (WMD).Since the Persian Gulf War in 1991 the U.S. and Britain had been keeping a tight rein on Saddam Hussein, waging an undeclared conflict against Iraq for twelve years. U.S. President Clinton had maintained sanctions and ordered air strikes in the Iraqi no-fly zones with Desert Fox, in the hope that Saddam would be overthrown by political enemies inside Iraq, and had signed into law H.R. 4655, the Liberation Act,(Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 The Library of Congress.) which appropriated funds to Iraqi opposition groups. Four countries participated with troops during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from March 19 to April 9, 2003. These were the United States (148,000), United Kingdom (45,000), Australia (2,000), and Poland (194). 36 other countries were involved in its aftermath.  In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S. troops were assembled in Kuwait by February 18.() The United States supplied the majority of the invading forces, but also received support from Kurdish irregulars in Kurdistan.According to U.S. President W. Bush and British Prime Minister Blair, the reasons for the invasion were to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Husseins alleged support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people.( However, former chief counter-terrorism adviser on the National Security Council A. Clarke believes Mr. Bush came into office with a plan to invade Iraq.(Andrew Buncombe, Richard Clarke: Iraq could be much more of a problem for America than if Saddam had stayed in power, The Monday Interview: Former White House security chief, Independent, Washington, June 14, 2004.) According to Blair, the trigger was Iraqs failure to take a final opportunity to disarm itself of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons that U.S. and British officials called an immediate and intolerable threat to world peace.() There also have been charges that the war was waged in order to take oil from Iraq.(U.S., U.K. Waged War on Iraq Because of Oil, Blair Adviser Says Bloomberg.com, May 1, 2003)(Report: Hundreds of WMDs Found in Iraq, FOXNews.com, June 22, 2006)(Fax and report, June 21, 2006) In 2005, the Intelligence Agency released a report saying that no weapons of mass destruction had been found in Iraq.()There was increasingly strong pressure among U.S. policy influencers, from the mid-1990s on, that regime change in Iraq was important to the overall goals of U.S. foreign policy. In 2001, within two weeks after the 11 attacks, Bush ordered that plans for the invasion be drawn up.() In a January 2003 CBS poll 64% of U.S. nationals had approved of military action against Iraq, however 63% wanted Bush to find a diplomatic solution rather than go to war, and 62% believed the threat of terrorism directed against the U.S. would increase due to war.(Poll: Talk First, Fight Later. CBS.com, Jan. 24, 2003. Retrieved on April 23, 2007.) The invasion of Iraq was strongly opposed by some traditional U.S. allies, including the governments of France, Germany, Zealand, and Canada.(Joint Declaration by Russia, Germany and France on Iraq France Diplomatie February 10, 2003)(NZ praised for steering clear of Iraq war The Dominion Post December 7, 2008)() Their leaders argued that there was no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that invading the country was not justified in the context of UNMOVICs February 12, 2003 report. On February 15, 2003, a month before the invasion, there were worldwide against the Iraq war, including a rally of three million people in Rome, which is listed in the Book of Records as the largest ever anti-war rally.() According to the French academic Reyni, between January 3 and April 12, 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the Iraq war.()The invasion was preceded by an strike on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on March 19, 2003. The following day coalition forces launched an incursion into Province from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While the special forces launched an amphibious assault from the Gulf to secure Basra and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the of Nasiriyah on March 23. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On March 26 the Airborne Brigade was airdropped near the northern city of Kirkuk where they joined forces with Kurdish rebels and fought several actions against the army to secure the northern part of the country.The main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on April 9. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on April 10, and the attack and capture of Tikrit on April 15. President Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On May 1 an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion period and beginning the occupation period.Prelude to the invasionFile:F-16s Southern Watch.jpg|thumb|left|Two Falcon aircraft prepare to depart on a patrol as part of Operation Southern WatchThe War ended on February 28, 1991 with a cease-fire negotiated between the UN Coalition and Iraq.() The U.S. and its allies tried to keep Saddam in check with military actions such as Southern Watch which was an conducted by Joint Task Force Southwest Asia (JTF-SWA) with the mission of monitoring and controlling airspace south of the 32nd Parallel (extended to the 33rd Parallel in 1996) as well as using economic sanctions. It was revealed the extent of  weapons (BW) program in Iraq begun in the early 1980s with help from the United States and Britain, in violation of the Weapons Convention (BWC) of 1972. Details of the BW  programalong with a chemical weapons programsurfaced in the wake of the Gulf War (199091) following investigations conducted by the Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) which had been charged with the post-war disarmament of Saddams Iraq. The investigation concluded that there was no evidence the program had continued after the war. The U.S. and its allies then maintained a policy of containment towards Iraq. This policy involved numerous economic sanctions by the Security Council, U.S. and UK enforcement of no-fly zones declared by the U.S. and the UK to protect Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan and Shias in the south from aerial attacks by Iraqi government during the 1991 uprisings, and ongoing inspections to prevent Iraqi development of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. Iraqi military helicopters and planes regularly contested the no-fly zones.()()File:Anthony C. Zinni speech following Operation Desert Fox.jpg||thumb|upright|Gen. Anthony C. Zinni briefs reporters at Pentagon following Operation Desert Fox, December 21, 1998In October 1998, removing the Hussein regime became official U.S. foreign policy with enactment of the Liberation Act. Enacted following the expulsion of UN weapons inspectors the preceding August after some had been accused of spying for the U.S. the act provided $97 million for Iraqi democratic opposition organizations to establish a program to support a transition to democracy in Iraq.() This legislation contrasted with the terms set out in Nations Security Council Resolution 687, which focused on weapons and weapons programs and made no mention of regime change.() One month after the passage of the Iraq Liberation Act, the U.S. and UK launched a bombardment campaign of Iraq called Desert Fox. The campaigns express rationale was to hamper the Hussein governments ability to produce chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, but U.S. intelligence personnel also hoped it would help weaken Husseins grip on power.( )With the election of George W. Bush as president in 2000, the U.S. moved towards a more aggressive policy toward Iraq. The Republican Partys campaign platform in the 2000 election called for full implementation of the Iraq Liberation Act and removal of Hussein. Key Bush advisors, including Vice President Cheney, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, and Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz, had long desired to invade Iraq.() After leaving the W. Bush administration, Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill said that an attack on Iraq had been planned since Bushs inauguration, and that the first States National Security Council meeting involved discussion of an invasion. ONeill later backtracked, saying that these discussions were part of a continuation of foreign policy first put into place by the administration.()Despite the Bush administrations stated interest in liberating Iraq, little formal movement towards an invasion occurred until the 11, 2001 attacks.  For example, the administration prepared Desert Badger to respond aggressively if any Air Force pilot was shot down while flying over Iraq, but this did not happen.  Rumsfeld dismissed Security Agency (NSA) intercept data available by midday of the 11th. that pointed to al-Qaedas culpability, and by mid-afternoon ordered the Pentagon to prepare plans for attacking Iraq.(Richard Aldrich, An extra copy for Mr Philby, in Literary Supplement, February 19, 2010 pp.7-8, p.7) According to aides who were with him in the Military Command Center on that day, Rumsfeld asked for: best info fast. Judge whether good enough hit Saddam Hussein at same time. Not only bin Laden.()  The rationale for invading Iraq as a response to 9/11 has been widely questioned, as there was no cooperation between Hussein and al-Qaeda.(Smith, Jeffrey R. Husseins Prewar Ties To Al-Qaeda Discounted. The Washington Post, Friday, April 6, 2007; Page A01. Retrieved on April 23, 2007.)Shortly after September 11, 2001 (on September 20), Bush addressed a joint session of Congress (simulcast live to the world), and announced his new on Terrorism. This announcement was accompanied by the doctrine of pre-emptive military action, later termed the Doctrine. Allegations of a connection  between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda were made by some U.S. Government officials who asserted that a highly secretive relationship existed between Saddam and the radical Islamist militant organization al-Qaeda from 1992 to 2003, specifically through a series of meetings reportedly involving the Intelligence Service (IIS). Some Bush advisers favored an immediate invasion of Iraq, while others advocated building an international coalition and obtaining Nations authorization. Bush eventually decided to seek UN authorization, while still reserving the option of invading without it.(Chronology of the Bush Doctrine. Frontline.org.

Bush, Presidents Remarks at the United Nations General Assembly: Remarks by the President in Address to the United Nations General Assembly, New York, New York, official transcript, press release, White House, September 12, 2002, accessed May 24, 2007.)Key U.S. allies in NATO, such as the United Kingdom, agreed with the U.S. actions, while France and Germany were critical of plans to invade Iraq, arguing instead for continued diplomacy and weapons inspections. After considerable debate, the UN Security Council adopted a compromise resolution, Security Council Resolution 1441, which authorized the resumption of weapons inspections and promised serious consequences for non-compliance. Security Council members France and Russia made clear that they did not consider these consequences to include the use of force to overthrow the Iraqi government.(France threatens rival UN Iraq draft. News, October 26, 2002. Retrieved on April 23, 2007) Both the U.S. ambassador to the UN, Negroponte, and the UK ambassador, Greenstock, publicly confirmed this reading of the resolution, assuring that Resolution 1441 provided no automaticity or hidden triggers for an invasion without further consultation of the Security Council.()Resolution 1441 gave Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations and set up inspections by the Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and the Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Hussein accepted the resolution on November 13 and inspectors returned to Iraq under the direction of UNMOVIC chairman Blix and IAEA Director General ElBaradei. As of February 2003, the IAEA found no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons program in Iraq; the IAEA concluded that certain items which could have been used in nuclear enrichment centrifuges, such as aluminum tubes, were in fact intended for other uses.()  UNMOVIC did not find evidence of the continuation or resumption of programs of weapons of mass destruction or significant quantities of proscribed items. UNMOVIC did supervise the destruction of a small number of empty chemical rocket warheads, 50 liters of mustard gas that had been declared by Iraq and sealed by UNSCOM in 1998, and laboratory quantities of a mustard gas precursor, along with about 50 Al-Samoud missiles of a design that Iraq stated did not exceed the permitted 150 km range, but which had travelled up to 183 km in tests. Shortly before the invasion, UNMOVIC stated that it would take months to verify Iraqi compliance with resolution 1441.()()(Hans Blixs briefing to the security council. Retrieved January 30, 2008.)In October 2002 the U.S. Congress passed a Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq. The resolution authorized the President to use any means necessary against Iraq, Americans polled in January 2003 widely favored further diplomacy over an invasion. Later that year, however, Americans began to agree with Bushs plan. The U.S. government engaged in an elaborate domestic public relations campaign to market the war to its citizens. Americans overwhelmingly believed Hussein did have weapons of mass destruction: 85% said so, even though the inspectors had not uncovered those weapons. Of those who thought Iraq had weapons sequestered somewhere, about half responded that said weapons would not be found in combat. By February 2003, 74% of Americans supported taking military action to remove Hussein from power.(The Intelligence Agencys Activities Division (SAD) teams were the first U.S. forces to enter Iraq, in July 2002, before the main invasion.  Once on the ground, they prepared for the subsequent arrival of U.S. Army Special Forces to organize the Kurdish Peshmerga. This joint team (called the Northern Iraq Liaison Element (NILE))(Plan of Attack, Bob Woodward, Simon and Shuster, 2004.) combined to defeat al-Islam, a group with ties to al-Qaeda, in Iraqi Kurdistan. This battle was for control of the territory that was occupied by Ansar al-Islam and took place before the invasion.  It was carried out by Paramilitary Operations Officers from SAD and the Armys 10th Special Forces Group.  This battle resulted in the defeat of Ansar and the capture of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat.( Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war.()()SAD teams also conducted missions behind enemy lines to identify leadership targets. These missions led to the initial strikes against Hussein and his generals. Although the strike against Hussein was unsuccessful in killing him, it effectively ended his ability to and control his forces. Strikes against Iraqs generals were more successful and significantly degraded the Iraqi commands ability to react to, and maneuver against the US-led invasion force.((Behind lines, an unseen war, Faye Bowers, Christian Science Monitor, April 2003.)  SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi Army officers into surrendering their units once the fighting started.(NATO member Turkey refused to allow the U.S. forces across its territory into northern Iraq.  Therefore, joint SAD and Army Special forces teams and the Pershmerga were the entire Northern force against the Iraqi army.  They managed to keep the northern divisions in place rather than allowing them to aid their colleagues against the U.S.-led coalition force coming from the south.()  Four of these CIA officers were awarded the Star for their actions.((In the State of the Union address, President Bush said we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs.() On February 5, 2003, U.S. Secretary of State Powell addressed the Nations General Assembly, continuing U.S. efforts to gain UN authorization for an invasion.His presentation to the UN Security Council, which contained a computer generated image of a mobile biological weapons laboratory. However, this information was based on claims of Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi codenamed Curveball, an Iraqi emigrant living in Germany who later admitted that his claims had been false.Powell also presented evidence alleging had ties to al-Qaeda. As a follow-up to Powells presentation, the United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Japan, and Spain proposed a resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq, but NATO members like Canada, France, and Germany, together with Russia, strongly urged continued diplomacy. Facing a losing vote as well as a likely veto from France and Russia, the US, UK, Spain, Poland, Denmark, Italy, Japan, and Australia eventually withdrew their resolution.()()Opposition to the invasion coalesced in the worldwide 15, 2003 anti-war protest that attracted between six and ten million people in more than 800 cities, the largest such protest in human history according to the Book of World Records.(Largest anti-war rally, Guinness Book of World Records, 2004)In March 2003, the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Australia, Poland, Denmark, and Italy began preparing for the invasion of Iraq, with a host of public relations and military moves. In his March 17, 2003 address to the nation, Bush demanded that Hussein and his two sons, Uday and Qusay, surrender and leave Iraq, giving them a 48-hour deadline.() But the U.S. began the bombing of Iraq on the day before the deadline expired. On March 18, 2003, the bombing of Iraq by the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Poland, Australia, and Denmark began. Unlike the first Gulf War or the in Afghanistan (2001present), this war had no explicit UN authorisation.The UK Parliament held a debate on going to war on March 18, 2003 where the government motion was approved 412 to 149.() The vote was a key moment in the history of the administration, as the number government MPs that rebelled against the vote was the greatest since the repeal of the Laws. Three government ministers resigned in protest at the war, John Denham, Hunt of Kings Heath, and the then of the House of Commons Cook. Speaking in the House of Commons after his resignation he made a passionate speech. He said, What has come to trouble me is the suspicion that if the hanging chads of Florida had gone the other way and Al Gore had been elected, we would not now be about to commit British troops to action in Iraq. During the debate it was stated that the Attorney General had advised that the war was legal under previous UN Resolutions.Attempts to avoid warIn December 2002, a representative of the head of Iraqi Intelligence, General Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, contacted former Intelligence Agency Counterterrorism Department head Cannistraro stating that Hussein knew there was a campaign to link him to September 11 and prove he had weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Cannistraro further added that the Iraqis were prepared to satisfy these concerns. I reported the conversation to senior levels of the state department and I was told to stand aside and they would handle it. Cannistraro stated that the offers made were all killed by the George W. Bush administration because they allowed Hussein to remain in power, an outcome viewed as unacceptable. It has been suggested that Saddam Hussein was prepared to go into exile if allowed to keep $1 billion USD.()Egyptian president Mubaraks national security advisor, El-Baz, sent a message to the U.S. State Department that the Iraqis wanted to discuss the accusations that the country had weapons of mass destruction and ties with al-Qaeda. Iraq also attempted to reach the U.S. through the Syrian, French, German, and Russian intelligence services. Nothing came of the attempts.In January 2003, Lebanese-American Imad Hage met with Michael Maloof of the U.S. Department of Defenses of Special Plans. Hage, a resident of Beirut, had been recruited by the department to assist in the on Terrorism. He reported that Mohammed Nassif, a close aide to Syrian president al-Assad, had expressed frustrations about the difficulties of Syria contacting the United States, and had attempted to use him as an intermediary. Maloof arranged for Hage to meet with civilian Perle, then head of the Policy Board.()()In January 2003, Hage met with the chief of Iraqi intelligences foreign operations, Hassan al-Obeidi. Obeidi told Hage that Baghdad did not understand why they were being targeted, and that they had no WMDs. He then made the offer for Washington to send in 2000 FBI agents to confirm this. He additionally offered petroleum concessions, but stopped short of having Hussein give up power, instead suggesting that elections could be held in two years. Later, Obeidi suggested that Hage travel to Baghdad for talks; he accepted.(Later that month, Hage met with General Habbush and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Aziz. He was offered top priority to U.S. firms in oil and mining rights, UN-supervised elections, U.S. inspections (with up to 5,000 inspectors), to have al-Qaeda agent Rahman Yasin (in Iraqi custody since 1994) handed over as a sign of good faith, and to give full support for any U.S. plan in the peace process. They also wished to meet with high-ranking U.S. officials. On February 19, Hage faxed Maloof his report of the trip. Maloof reports having brought the proposal to Jamie Duran. Pentagon denies that either Wolfowitz or Rumsfeld, Durans bosses, were aware of the plan.(On February 21, Maloof informed Duran in an email that Richard Perle wished to meet with Hage and the Iraqis if the Pentagon would clear it. Duran responded Mike, working this. Keep this close hold. On March 7, Perle met with Hage in Knightsbridge, and stated that he wanted to pursue the matter further with people in Washington (both have acknowledged the meeting). A few days later, he informed Hage that Washington refused to let him meet with Habbush to discuss the offer (Hage stated that Perles response was that the consensus in Washington was it was a no-go). Perle told Times, The message was Tell them that we will see them in Baghdad.  Casus belli and rationale George Bush, speaking in October 2002, said that The stated policy of the United States is regime change However, if Hussein were to meet all the conditions of the United Nations, the conditions that I have described very clearly in terms that everybody can understand, that in itself will signal the regime has changed.() Citing reports from certain intelligence sources, Bush stated on March 6, 2003 that he believed that Hussein was not complying with Resolution 1441.()In September 2002, Tony Blair stated, in an answer to a parliamentary question, that Regime change in Iraq would be a wonderful thing. That is not the purpose of our action; our purpose is to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction() In November of that year, Blair further stated that, So far as our objective, it is disarmament, not rgime change - that is our objective. Now I happen to believe the regime of Saddam is a very brutal and repressive regime, I think it does enormous damage to the Iraqi people... so I have got no doubt Saddam is very bad for Iraq, but on the other hand I have got no doubt either that the purpose of our challenge from the United Nations is disarmament of weapons of mass destruction, it is not regime change.()At a press conference on January 31, 2003, Bush again reiterated that the single trigger for the invasion would be Iraqs failure to disarm, Saddam Hussein must understand that if he does not disarm, for the sake of peace, we, along with others, will go disarm Saddam Hussein.() As late as February 25, 2003, it was still the official line that the only cause of invasion would be a failure to disarm. As Blair made clear in a statement to the House of Commons, I detest his regime. But even now he can save it by complying with the UNs demand. Even now, we are prepared to go the extra step to achieve disarmament peacefully.()Additional justifications used at various times included Iraqi violation of UN resolutions, the Iraqi governments repression of its citizens, and Iraqi violations of the 1991 cease-fire.()The main allegations were that Hussein possessed or was attempting to produce weapons of mass destruction which Saddam Hussein, had used such as in Halabja,()(Halabja, the massacre the West tried to ignore) possessed, and made efforts to acquire. Particularly considering two previous attacks on Baghdad nuclear weapons production facilities by both Iran and Israel which was alleged to have postponed weapons development progress. And that he had ties to terrorists, specifically al-Qaeda.While it never made an explicit connection between Iraq and the September 11 attacks, the George W. Bush administration repeatedly insinuated a link, thereby creating a false impression for the U.S. public. Grand jury testimony from the World Trade Center attack trials cited numerous direct linkages from the bombers to Baghdad and Department 13 of the Iraqi Intelligence Service in that initial attack marking the second anniversary to vindicate the surrender of Iraqi armed forces in Desert Storm. For example, Washington Post has noted that,While not explicitly declaring Iraqi culpability in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, administration officials did, at various times, imply a link. In late 2001, Cheney said it was pretty well confirmed that attack mastermind Mohamed Atta had met with a senior Iraqi intelligence official. Later, Cheney called Iraq the geographic base of the terrorists who had us under assault now for many years, but most especially on 9/11.()Steven Kull, director of the on International Policy Attitudes (PIPA) at the University of Maryland, observed in March 2003 that The administration has succeeded in creating a sense that there is some connection Sept. 11 and Saddam Hussein. This was following a York Times/CBS poll that showed 45% of Americans believing Saddam Hussein was personally involved in the September 11 atrocities. As the Science Monitor observed at the time, while Sources knowledgeable about U.S. intelligence say there is no evidence that Hussein played a role in the Sept. 11 attacks, nor that he has been or is currently aiding Al Qaeda... the White House appears to be encouraging this false impression, as it seeks to maintain American support for a possible war against Iraq and demonstrate seriousness of purpose to Husseins regime. The CSM went on to report that, while polling data collected right after Sept. 11, 2001 showed that only 3 percent mentioned Iraq or Saddam Hussein, by January 2003 attitudes had been transformed with a Knight Ridder poll showing that 44% of Americans believed most or some of the September 11 hijackers were Iraqi citizens.()The BBC has also noted that while President Bush, never directly accused the former Iraqi leader of having a hand in the attacks on New York and Washington, he, repeatedly associated the two in keynote addresses delivered since September 11, adding that, Senior members of his administration have similarly conflated the two. For instance, the BBC report quotes Colin Powell in February 2003, stating that, Weve learned that Iraq has trained al-Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after September 11, Saddam Husseins regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on America. The same BBC report also noted the results of a recent opinion poll, which suggested that 70% of Americans believe the Iraqi leader was personally involved in the attacks.()Also in September 2003, the Boston Globe reported that Vice President Dick Cheney, anxious to defend the White House foreign policy amid ongoing violence in Iraq, stunned intelligence analysts and even members of his own administration this week by failing to dismiss a widely discredited claim: that Saddam Hussein might have played a role in the Sept. 11 attacks.() A year later, presidential candidate Kerry alleged that Cheney was continuing to intentionally mislead the American public by drawing a link between Saddam Hussein and 9/11 in an attempt to make the invasion of Iraq part of the global war on terror.()Throughout 2002, the Bush administration insisted that removing Hussein from power to restore international peace and security was a major goal. The principal stated justifications for this policy of regime change were that Iraqs continuing production of weapons of mass destruction and known ties to terrorist organizations, as well as Iraqs continued violations of UN Security Council resolutions, amounted to a threat to the U.S. and the world community.File:Powell-anthrax-vial.jpg|thumb|Powell holding a model vial of anthrax while giving presentation to the United Nations Security Council on February 5, 2003 (still photograph captured from video clip, The White House/CNN)The Bush administrations overall rationale for the invasion of Iraq was presented in detail by  U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell to the Nations Security Council on February 5, 2003. In summary, he stated,Since the invasion, the  U.S. and British government statements concerning Iraqi weapons programs and links to terrorist organizations have been discredited. While the debate of whether Iraq intended to develop chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons in the future remains open, no WMDs have been found in Iraq since the invasion despite comprehensive inspections lasting more than 18 months.(CIAs final report: No WMD found in Iraq. MSNBC.com, April 25, 2005. Retrieved on April 5, 2007, Associated Press) In Cairo, on February 24, 2001, Colin Powell had predicted as much, saying, Hussein has not developed any significant capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction. He is unable to project conventional power against his neighbours.() Similarly, assertions of significant operational links between the Iraqi regime and al-Qaeda have largely been discredited by the intelligence community, and Secretary Powell himself eventually admitted he had no incontrovertible proof.()In September 2002, the Bush administration said attempts by Iraq to acquire thousands of high-strength aluminum tubes pointed to a clandestine program to make enriched uranium for nuclear bombs. Powell, in his address to the UN Security Council just before the war, referred to the aluminum tubes. A report released by the for Science and International Security in 2002, however, reported that it was highly unlikely that the tubes could be used to enrich uranium. Powell later admitted he had presented an inaccurate case to the United Nations on Iraqi weapons, based on sourcing that was wrong and in some cases deliberately misleading.(Evidence on Iraq Challenged, Joby Warrick, The Washington Post, Sept. 19, 2002)(Colin Powells speech to the UN, Feb 5, 2003)(Meet the Press, NBC, May 16, 2004)The Bush administration asserted that the Hussein government had sought to purchase yellowcake uranium from Niger.(Lichtblau, Eric. 2002 Memo Doubted Uranium Sale Claim, New York Times, January 18, 2006. Retrieved on May 10, 2007.) On March 7, 2003, the U.S. submitted intelligence documents as evidence to the Atomic Energy Agency. These documents were dismissed by the IAEA as forgeries, with the concurrence in that judgment of outside experts. At the time, a US official stated that the evidence was submitted to the IAEA without knowledge of its provenance and characterized any mistakes as more likely due to incompetence not malice. Unmanned Iraqi drones In October 2002, a few days before the US Senate vote on the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution, about 75 senators were told in session that the Iraqi government had the means of delivering biological and weapons of mass destruction by aerial vehicle (UAV) drones that could be launched from ships off the US Atlantic coast to attack US eastern seaboard cities. Powell suggested in his presentation to the United Nations that UAVs were transported out of Iraq and could be launched against the United States. In fact, Iraq had no offensive UAV fleet or any capability of putting UAVs on ships.(Senator Nelson (January 28, 2004) New Information on Iraqs Possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction, Congressional Record) Iraqs UAV fleet consisted of less than a handful of outdated Czech training drones.(Lowe, C. (December 16, 2003) Senator: White House Warned of UAV Attack, Defense Tech) At the time, there was a vigorous dispute within the intelligence community whether the CIAs conclusions about Iraqs UAV fleet were accurate. The Air Force agency denied outright that Iraq possessed any offensive UAV capability.(Hammond, J. (November 14, 2005) The U.S. intelligence failure and Iraqs UAVs The Yirmeyahu Review) Human rights As evidence supporting U.S. and British charges about Iraqi WMDs and links to terrorism weakened, some supporters of the invasion have increasingly shifted their justification to the human rights violations of the Hussein government.(Senators Slam Shifting Iraq War Justification. Islamonline. July 30, 2003.) Leading human rights groups such as Rights Watch have argued, however, that they believe human rights concerns were never a central justification for the invasion, nor do they believe that military intervention was justifiable on humanitarian grounds, most significantly because the killing in Iraq at the time was not of the exceptional nature that would justify such intervention.(Roth, Ken. War in Iraq: Not a Humanitarian Intervention Human Rights Watch. January 2004. Retrieved April 6, 2007.) Many supporters of the war, however, contend that from the start human rights concerns were among the reasons given for the invasion, and that the threat of weapons of mass destruction was emphasized at the United Nations, since this dealt with Iraq flouting UN resolutions. They further argue that human rights groups that oppose the war have no objective standard regarding when to invade a country.Legality of invasionFile:Bush auth jbc.jpg|thumb|President George Bush, surrounded by leaders of the House and Senate, announces the Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq, October 2, 2002.The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 was passed by congress with Republicans voting 98% in favor in the Senate, and 97% in favor in the House.  Democrats supported the resolution 58% and 39% in the Senate and House respectively.()() The resolution asserts the authorization by the of the United States and the Congress for the President to fight anti-United States terrorism. Citing the Liberation Act of 1998, the resolution reiterated that it should be the policy of the United States to remove the Saddam Hussein regime and promote a democratic replacement.The resolution supported and encouraged diplomatic efforts by President George W. Bush to strictly enforce through the U.N. Security Council all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq and obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, evasion, and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies with all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.  The resolution authorized President Bush to use the Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate to defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant Nations Security Council Resolutions regarding Iraq.The legality of the invasion of Iraq has been challenged since its inception on a number of fronts, and several prominent supporters of the invasion in all the invading nations have publicly and privately cast doubt on its legality. It is argued that the invasion was fully legal because authorization was implied by the Nations Security Council.(Saddam Husseins Defiance of UNSCRs)(UN Security Council Resolution 1441 ) International legal experts, including the Commission of Jurists, a group of 31 leading Canadian law professors, and the U.S.-based Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy, have denounced both of these rationales.()()()On Thursday November 20, 2003, an article published in the Guardian alleged that Perle, a senior member of the administrations Policy Board Advisory Committee, conceded that the invasion was illegal but still justified.()()The United Nations Security Council has passed nearly 60 resolutions on Iraq and Kuwait since Iraqs invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The most relevant to this issue is Resolution 678, passed on November 29, 1990. It authorizes member states co-operating with the Government of Kuwait... to use all necessary means to (1) implement Security Council Resolution 660 and other resolutions calling for the end of Iraqs occupation of Kuwait and withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti territory and (2) restore international peace and security in the area. Resolution 678 has not been rescinded or nullified by succeeding resolutions and Iraq was not alleged after 1991 to invade Kuwait or to threaten do so.Resolution 1441 was most prominent during the run up to the war and formed the main backdrop for Secretary of State Powells address to the Security Council one month before the invasion.(Transcript of Powells U.N. Presentation.CNN.com) According to an independent commission of inquiry set up by the government of the Netherlands, UN resolution 1441 cannot reasonably be interpreted (as the Dutch government did) as authorising individual member states to use military force to compel Iraq to comply with the Security Councils resolutions. Accordingly, the Dutch commission concluded that the 2003 invasion violated international law.(The Guardian, 12 January 2010, Iraq Invasion Violated International Law, Dutch Inquiry Finds: Investigation into the Netherlands Support for 2003 War Finds Military Action was Not Justified under UN Resolutions, http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/12/iraq-invasion-violated-interational-law-dutch-inquiry-finds)File:Bush announces Operation Iraqi Freedom 2003.jpg|thumb|President George W.

The Senate committee found that many of the administrations pre-war statements about Iraqi WMD were not supported by the underlying intelligenceAt the same time, Bush Administration officials advanced a parallel legal argument using the earlier resolutions, which authorized force in response to Iraqs 1990 of Kuwait. Under this reasoning, by failing to disarm and submit to weapons inspections, Iraq was in violation of Security Council Resolutions 660 and 678, and the U.S. could legally compel Iraqs compliance through military means.Critics and proponents of the legal rationale based on the U.N. resolutions argue that the legal right to determine how to enforce its resolutions lies with the Security Council alone, not with individual nations.In February 2006, Moreno Ocampo, the lead prosecutor for the Criminal Court, reported that he had received 240 separate communications regarding the legality of the war, many of which concerned British participation in the invasion.(Richard Norton-Taylor International court hears anti-war claims in Guardian May 6, 2005.) In a letter addressed to the complainants, Mr. Moreno Ocampo explained that he could only consider issues related to conduct during the war and not to its underlying legality as a possible crime of aggression because no provision had yet been adopted which defines the crime and sets out the conditions under which the Court may exercise jurisdiction with respect to it. In a March 2007 interview with the Telegraph, Moreno Ocampo encouraged Iraq to sign up with the court so that it could bring cases related to alleged war crimes.(Chamberlin, Gethin.

The War in Iraq. ADF Operations in the Middle East in 2003. Page 11.) The invasion force was also supported by Iraqi Kurdish militia troops, estimated to number upwards of 70,000.() In the latter stages of the invasion 620 troops of the Iraqi National Congress opposition group were deployed to southern Iraq.()A U.S. Central Command, Combined Forces Air Component Commander report, indicated that as of April 30, 2003, there were a total of 466,985 U.S. personnel deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Once on the ground they prepared for the subsequent arrival of US military forces. SAD teams then combined with Army Special Forces to organize the Kurdish Peshmerga. This joint team combined to defeat al-Islam, an ally of Al Qaida, in a battle in the northeast corner of Iraq.  The US side was carried out by Paramilitary Officers from SAD and the Armys 10th Special Forces Group.(((SAD teams also conducted high risk special reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines to identify senior leadership targets.  These missions led to the initial strikes against Saddam Hussein and his key generals.  Although the initial strike against Hussein was unsuccessful in killing the dictator, it was successful in effectively ending his ability to command and control his forces.  Other strikes against key generals were successful and significantly degraded the commands ability to react to and maneuver against the US-led invasion force coming from the south.((SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi army officers to surrender their units once the fighting started and/or not to oppose the invasion force.(  NATO member Turkey refused to allow its territory to be used for the invasion.  As a result, the SAD/SOG and US Army Special Forces joint teams and the Kurdish Peshmerga were the entire northern force against government forces during the invasion.  Their efforts kept the 5th Corps of the Iraqi army in place to defend against the Kurds rather than their moving to contest the coalition force.According to General Tommy Franks, April Fool, an American officer working undercover as a diplomat, was approached by an Iraqi agent. April Fool then sold to the Iraqi false top secret invasion plans provided by Franks team.  This decoy deception successfully misled the Iraqi military into deploying major forces in Northern and Western Iraq in anticipation of attacks by way of Turkey or Jordan, which never took place.  This greatly reduced the defensive capacity in the rest of Iraq and significantly facilitated the actual attacks via Kuwait and the Gulf in the southeast.Defending forceFile:T-72-Fort Hood.jpg|thumb|T-72 of Babylon tank (Asad Babil)The number of personnel in the Iraqi military prior to the war was uncertain, but it was believed to have been poorly equipped.()()() The International Institute for Strategic Studies estimated the Iraqi armed forces to number 538,000 (Army 375,000, Navy 2,000, Air Force 20,000 and air defense 17,000), the paramilitary Saddam 44,000, Republican Guard 80,000 and reserves 650,000.()Another estimate numbers the Army and Republican Guard at between 280,000 to 350,000 and 50,000 to 80,000, respectively,() and the paramilitary between 20,000 and 40,000.() There were an estimated thirteen infantry divisions, ten mechanized and armored divisions, as well as some forces units. The Iraqi Air Force and Navy played a negligible role in the conflict.During the invasion, foreign volunteers traveled to Iraq from Syria and took part in the fighting, usually under the command of the Fedayeen Saddam. It is not known for certain how many foreign fighters fought in Iraq in 2003, however, intelligence officers of the U.S. First Marine Division estimated that 50% of all Iraqi combatants in central Iraq were foreigners.(Wright, Generation Kill, page 249. Berkley Publishing Group, 2004. ISBN 978-0-399-15193-4)(David Zucchino, Thunder Run, page 189. Grove Press, 2004. ISBN 978-0-8021-4179-8)In addition, the Kurdish Islamist militant group al-Islam controlled a small section of northern Iraq in an area outside of Saddam Husseins control. Ansar al-Islam had been fighting against secular Kurdish forces since 2001. At the time of the invasion they fielded approximately 600 to 800 fighters.() Ansar al-Islam was led by the Jordanian-born militant Musab al-Zarqawi, who would later become an important leader in the insurgency. Ansar al-Islam was driven out of Iraq in late March by a joint American-Kurdish force during Viking Hammer.InvasionSince the 1991 War, the U.S. and UK had been engaged in low-level attacks on Iraqi air defenses which targeted them while enforcing no-fly zones.(( These zones, and the attacks to enforce them, were described as illegal by the former UN Secretary General, Boutros-Ghali, and the French foreign minister Vedrine. Other countries, notably Russia and China, also condemned the zones as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty.()()() In mid-2002, the U.S. began more carefully selecting targets in the southern part of the country to disrupt the military command structure in Iraq. A change in enforcement tactics was acknowledged at the time, but it was not made public that this was part of a plan known as Southern Focus.The amount of ordnance dropped on Iraqi positions by Coalition aircraft in 2001 and 2002 was less than in 1999 and 2000 which was during the Clinton administration.() This information has been used to attempt to refute the theory that the Bush administration had already decided to go to war against Iraq before coming to office and that the bombing during 2001 and 2002 was laying the groundwork for the eventual invasion in 2003. However, information obtained by the UK Democrats showed that the UK dropped twice as many bombs on Iraq in the second half of 2002 as they did during the whole of 2001. The tonnage of UK bombs dropped increased from 0 in March 2002 and 0.3 in April 2002 to between 7 and 14 tons per month in MayAugust, reaching a pre-war peak of 54.6 tons in September  before Congress October 11 authorization of the invasion.The September 5 attacks included a 100+ aircraft attack on the main air defense site in western Iraq. According to an editorial in Statesman this was Located at the furthest extreme of the southern no-fly zone, far away from the areas that needed to be patrolled to prevent attacks on the Shias, it was destroyed not because it was a threat to the patrols, but to allow allied special forces operating from Jordan to enter Iraq undetected.()Tommy Franks, who commanded the invasion of Iraq, has since admitted that the bombing was designed to degrade Iraqi air defences in the same way as the air attacks that began the 1991 Gulf War. These spikes of activity were, in the words of then British Defence Secretary, Hoon, designed to put pressure on the Iraqi regime or, as Times reported, to provoke Saddam Hussein into giving the allies an excuse for war. In this respect, as provocations designed to start a war, leaked British Foreign Office legal advice concluded that such attacks were illegal under international law.()()Another attempt at provoking the war was mentioned in a leaked memo from a meeting between George W. Bush and Tony Blair on January 31, 2003 at which Bush allegedly told Blair that The US was thinking of flying U2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over Iraq, painted in UN colours. If Saddam fired on them, he would be in breach.()  On March 17, 2003, U.S. President W. Bush gave Saddam Hussein 48 hours to leave the country, along with his sons Uday and Qusay, or face war.Opening salvo: the Dora Farms strikeFile:F-117A GBU-28.JPEG|right|thumb|An F-117 conducts a live exercise bombing run using GBU-27 laser-guided bombs on Iraq.On the early morning of March 19, 2003, U.S. forces abandoned the plan for initial, non-nuclear strikes against fifty-five top Iraqi officials, in light of reports that Saddam Hussein was visiting his daughters and sons, Uday and Qusay at Dora Farms, within the al-Dora farming community on the outskirts of Baghdad.() At approximately 05:30 UTC two Nighthawks from the 8th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron() dropped four enhanced, satellite-guided 2,000-pound GBU-27 Busters on the compound. Complementing the aerial bombardment were nearly 40 cruise missiles fired from at least four ships, including the Burke class destroyer USS Donald Cook, and two submarines in the Sea and Gulf.()One bomb missed the compound entirely and the other three missed their target, landing on the other side of the wall of the palace compound.() Saddam Hussein was not present nor were any members of the Iraqi leadership.(() The attack killed one civilian and injured fourteen others, including four men, nine women and one child.( )() Later investigation revealed that Saddam Hussein had not visited the farm since 1995.(Opening attackOn March 20, 2003 at approximately 02:30 UTC or about 90 minutes after the lapse of the 48-hour deadline, at 05:33 local time, explosions were heard in Baghdad. Special operations commandos from the CIAs Activities Division from the Northern Iraq Liaison Element infiltrated throughout Iraq and called in the early air strikes.( At 03:15 UTC, or 10:15 p.m. EST, George W. Bush announced that he had ordered an attack of opportunity against targets in Iraq.() When this word was given, the troops on standby crossed the border into Iraq.File:F-15 wingtip vortices.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wingtip vortices are visible trailing from an F-15E as it disengages from midair refueling with a KC-10 during Operation Iraqi FreedomBefore the invasion, many observers had expected a lengthy campaign of aerial bombing before any ground action, taking as examples the 1991 Persian Gulf War or the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. In practice, U.S. plans envisioned simultaneous air and ground assaults to decapitate the Iraqi forces quickly (see and Awe), attempting to bypass Iraqi military units and cities in most cases. The assumption was that superior mobility and coordination of Coalition forces would allow them to attack the heart of the Iraqi command structure and destroy it in a short time, and that this would minimize civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure. It was expected that the elimination of the leadership would lead to the collapse of the Iraqi Forces and the government, and that much of the population would support the invaders once the government had been weakened. Occupation of cities and attacks on peripheral military units were viewed as undesirable distractions.Following Turkeys decision to deny any official use of its territory, the Coalition was forced to modify the planned simultaneous attack from north and south.(Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq, Mike Tucker, Charles Faddis, 2008, The Lyons Press.)  Special Operations forces from the CIA and US Army managed to build and lead the Kurdish Peshmerga into an effective force and assault for the North. The primary bases for the invasion were in Kuwait and other Gulf nations. One result of this was that one of the divisions intended for the invasion was forced to relocate and was unable to take part in the invasion until well into the war. Many observers felt that the Coalition devoted sufficient numbers of troops to the invasion, but too many were withdrawn after it ended, and that the failure to occupy cities put them at a major disadvantage in achieving security and order throughout the country when local support failed to meet expectations.File:Baghdad etm 2003092 lrg.jpg|thumb|upright|NASA 7 image of Baghdad, April 2, 2003. The dark streaks are smoke from oil well fires set in an attempt to hinder attacking air forcesThe invasion was swift, leading to the collapse of the Iraqi government and the of Iraq in about three weeks. The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly seized and secured with limited damage in that time. Securing the oil infrastructure was considered of great importance. In the Gulf War, while retreating from Kuwait, the Iraqi army had set many oil wells on fire in an attempt to disguise troop movements and to distract Coalition forces. Before the 2003 invasion, Iraqi forces had mined some 400 oil wells around Basra and the peninsula with explosives. Coalition troops launched an air and assault on the peninsula during the closing hours of March 19 to secure the oil fields there; the amphibious assault was supported by warships of the Navy, Navy, and Australian Navy.British Commando Brigade, with the States Marine Corps Marine Expeditionary Unit and the Polish Special Forces unit GROM attached, attacked the port of Qasr. There they met with heavy resistance by Iraqi troops. A total of 14 Coalition troops and 30-40 Iraqi troops were killed, and 450 Iraqis taken prisoner. The Armys Air Assault Brigade also secured the oil fields in southern Iraq in places like Rumaila while the Polish commandos captured offshore oil platforms near the port, preventing their destruction. Despite the rapid advance of the invasion forces, some 44 oil wells were destroyed and set ablaze by Iraqi explosives or by incidental fire. However, the wells were quickly capped and the fires put out, preventing the ecological damage and loss of oil production capacity that had occurred at the end of the Gulf War.In keeping with the rapid advance plan, the 3rd Infantry Division moved westward and then northward through the western desert toward Baghdad, while the Marine Expeditionary Force moved along Highway 1 through the center of the country, and (UK) Armoured Division moved northward through the eastern marshland.During the first week of the war, Iraqi forces fired a Scud missile at the American Battlefield Update Assessment center in Doha, Kuwait. The missile was intercepted and shot down by a missile seconds before hitting the complex. Subsequently, two Warthogs bombed the missile launcher.Battle of NasiriyahInitially, the U.S. Marine Division fought through the oil fields, and moved north to Nasiriyaha moderate-sized, Shiite dominated city with important strategic significance as a major road junction and its proximity to nearby Talil Airfield. It was also situated near a number of strategically important bridges over the Euphrates River. The city was defended by a mix of regular Iraqi army units, Baath loyalists, and Fedayeen from both Iraq and abroad. The United States Army 3rd Infantry Division defeated Iraqi forces entrenched in and around the airfield and bypassed the city to the west.On March 23, a convoy from the 3rd Infantry Division, including the female American soldiers Lynch and Piestewa, was ambushed after taking a wrong turn into the city. Eleven U.S. soldiers were killed, and seven, including Lynch and Piestewa, were captured.() Piestewa died of wounds shortly after capture, while the remaining five prisoners of war were later rescued. Piestewa, who was from City, Arizona, and an enrolled member of the Hopi Tribe, was believed to have been the first Native American woman killed in combat in a foreign war. On the same day, U.S Marines entered Nasiriyah in force, facing heavy resistance as they moved to secure two major bridges in the city. Several Marines were killed during a firefight with Fedayeen in the urban fighting. At the Saddam Canal, another 18 Marines were killed in heavy fighting with Iraqi soldiers. An Air Force A-10 was involved in a case of fire that resulted in the death of six Marines when it accidentally attacked an American amphibious vehicle. Two other vehicles were destroyed when a barrage of RPG and small arms fire killed most of the Marines inside.() A Marine from Air Control Group 28 was killed by enemy fire, and two Marine engineers drowned in the Saddam Canal.On the evening of March 24, a battalion of the 1st Marine Regiment pushed through Nasiriyah and established a perimeter 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) north of the city. Iraqi reinforcements from Kut launched several counterattacks. The Marines managed to repel them using indirect fire and close air support. The last Iraqi attack was beaten off at dawn. The battalion estimated that 200-300 Iraqi soldiers were killed, without a single U.S. casualty. Nasiriyah was declared secure, but attacks by Iraqi Fedayeen continued. These attacks were uncoordinated, and resulted in firefights in which large numbers of Fedayeen were killed. Because of Nasiriyahs strategic position as a road junction, a significant gridlock occurred as U.S. forces moving north converged on the citys surrounding highways.With the Nasiriyah and Talil Airfields secured, Coalition forces gained an important logistical center in southern Iraq and established FOB/EAF Jalibah, some  outside of Nasiriyah. Additional troops and supplies were soon brought through this forward operating base. The Airborne Division continued its attack north in support of the 3rd Infantry Division.By March 28, a severe sand storm slowed the Coalition advance as the 3rd Infantry Division halted its northward drive half way between Najaf and Karbala. As a result of heavy rains that occurred along with the sand storm, orange-colored mud fell on some parts of the invasion force in the area. Air operations by helicopters, poised to bring reinforcements from the 101st Airborne, were blocked for three days. There was particularly heavy fighting in and around the bridge near the town of Kufl.Battle of NajafFile:DestroyedT-72outsidenajaf.jpg|thumb|Destroyed Iraqi T-72 tank on Highway 9 outside NajafAnother fierce battle was at Najaf, where U.S. airborne and armored units with British air support fought a fierce battle with Iraqi Regulars, Republican Guard units, and paramilitary forces. It started with U.S. Apache helicopter gunships setting out on a mission to attack Republican Guard armored units, and while flying low, came under heavy anti-aircraft, small arms, and RPG fire which disrupted the attack and led to one of the gunships down and many heavily damaged.() They attacked again successfully on March 26, this time after a pre-mission artillery barrage and with support from Hornet jets, with no gunships lost.()The 1st Brigade Combat Teams air defense battery moved in and after heavy fighting with entrenched Iraqi Fedayeen seized a strategic bridge in Najaf, known as Objective Jenkins. They then came under fierce counter attacks by Iraqi forces and Fedayeen, but they failed to dislodge U.S. forces from their positions. After 36 hours of combat at the bridge at Najaf, the Iraqis were defeated, and the key bridge was secured, isolating Najaf from the north.()The Airborne Division on March 29, supported by a battalion from the 1st Armored Division attacked Iraqi forces in the southern part of the city, near the Ali Mosque and captured Najafs airfield.() However, four Americans were killed by a bomber. Then on March 31, the 101st launched an attack with a reconnaissance-in-force into Najaf and on April 1, elements of the 70th Armored Regiment launched a Thunder Run, a armored thrust through Najafs city center and after several days of heavy fighting and with air support was able to defeat the Iraqi forces, slowly securing the city by April 4.()(BasraThe Iraqi port city of Qasr was the first British obstacle. A joint Polish-British-American force ran into unexpectedly stiff resistance, and it took several days to clear the Iraqi forces out. Farther north, the 7 Armoured Brigade (The Desert Rats), fought their way into Iraqs second-largest city, Basra, on April 6, coming under constant attack by regulars and Fedayeen, while 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (the British Red Devils) cleared the old quarter of the city that was inaccessible to vehicles. Entering Basra was achieved after two weeks of fierce fighting, which included the biggest tank battle by British forces since War II when the Scots Dragoon Guards destroyed 14 Iraqi tanks on 27 March.Elements of (UK) Armoured Division began to advance north towards U.S. positions around Al Amarah on April 9. Pre-existing electrical and water shortages continued throughout the conflict and looting began as Iraqi forces collapsed. While Coalition forces began working with local Iraqi Police to enforce order, a joint team composed of Engineers and the Royal Logistics Corps of the British Army rapidly set up and repaired dockyard facilities to allow humanitarian aid to begin to arrive from ships arriving in the port city of Qasr.After a rapid initial advance, the first major pause occurred near Karbala. There, U.S. Army elements met resistance from Iraqi troops defending cities and key bridges along the Euphrates River. These forces threatened to interdict supply routes as American forces moved north. Eventually, troops from the 101st Airborne Division of the U.S Army secured the cities of Najaf and Karbala to prevent any Iraqi counterattacks on the 3rd Infantry Divisions lines of communication as the division pressed its advance toward Baghdad.A total of 11 British soldiers were killed, while 395-515 Iraqi soldiers, irregulars, and Fedayeen were killed.Battle of KarbalaThe Karbala Gap was a 20-25-mile wide strip of land with the Euphrates River to the east and Razazah to the west. This strip of land was recognized by Iraqi commanders as a key approach to Baghdad, and was defended by some of the best units of the Republican Guard. The Iraqi high command had originally positioned two Republican Guard divisions blocking the Karbala Gap.() Here these forces suffered heavy Coalition air attacks. However, the Coalition had since the beginning of March been conducting a strategic deception operation to convince the Iraqis that the U.S. 4th Infantry Division would be mounting a major assault into northern Iraq from Turkey.()This deception plan worked, and on April 2 Saddams son Hussein declared that the American invasion from the south was a feint and ordered troops to be re-deployed from the Karbala front to the north of Baghdad. Lt. Gen. Raad al-Hamdani, who was in command of the Karbala region, protested this and argued that unless reinforcements were rushed to the Karbala gap immediately to prevent a breach, U.S. forces would reach Baghdad within 48 hours, but his suggestions fell on deaf ears. American troops rushed through the gap and reached the Euphrates River at the town of Musayib. At Musayib, U.S. troops crossed the Euphrates in boats and seized the vital al-Kaed bridge across the Euphrates after Iraqi demolitions teams had failed to destroy it in time.The 10th Armored Brigade from the Medina Division and the 22nd Armored Brigade from the Nebuchadnezzar Division, supported by artillery, launched night attacks against the U.S. bridgehead at Musayib. The attack was repulsed using tank fire and massed artillery rockets, destroying or disabling every Iraqi tank in the assault. The next morning, Coalition aircraft and helicopters fired on the Republican Guard units, destroying many more vehicles as well as communications infrastructure. The Republican Guard units broke under the massed firepower and lost any sense of command and cohesion and the U.S. forces poured through gap on to Baghdad.Special operationsThe 2nd Battalion of the U.S. Special Forces Group, States Army Special Forces (Green Berets) conducted reconnaissance in the cities of Basra, Karbala and various other locations.In the North, the Special Forces Group (10th SFG) and CIA paramilitary officers from their Activities Division had the mission of aiding the Kurdish parties, the Union of Kurdistan and the Democratic Party, de facto rulers of Kurdistan since 1991, and employing them against the 13 Iraqi Divisions located near Kirkuk and Mosul. Turkey had officially prohibited any Coalition troops from using their bases or airspace, so lead elements of the 10th SFG had to make a detour infiltration; their flight was supposed to take four hours but instead took ten.Hours after the first of such flights, Turkey did allow the use of its air space and the rest of the 10th SFG infiltrated in. The preliminary mission was to destroy the base of the Kurdish terrorist group al-Islam, believed to be linked to al-Qaeda. Concurrent and follow-on missions involved attacking and fixing Iraqi forces in the north, thus preventing their deployment to the southern front and the main effort of the invasion.On March 26, 2003, the Airborne Brigade augmented the invasions northern front by parachuting into northern Iraq onto Bashur Airfield, controlled at the time by elements of 10th SFG and Kurdish peshmerga. The fall of Kirkuk on April 10, 2003 to the 10th SFG, CIA Paramilitary Teams and Kurdish peshmerga precipitated the 173rds planned assault, preventing the units involvement in combat against Iraqi forces during the invasion.The successful occupation of Kirkuk came as a result of approximately two weeks of fighting that included the Battle of the Green Line (the unofficial border of the Kurdish autonomous zone) and the subsequent Battle of Kani Domlan Ridge (the ridgeline running northwest to southeast of Kirkuk), the latter fought exclusively by 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and Kurdish peshmerga against the Iraqi I Corps. The 173rd Brigade would eventually take responsibility for Kirkuk days later, becoming involved in the counterinsurgency fight and remain there until redeploying a year later.Further reinforcing operations in Northern Iraq, the Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable), serving as Landing Force Sixth Fleet, deployed in April to Erbil and subsequently Mosul via Marine KC-130 flights. The 26 MEU (SOC) maintained security of the Mosul airfield and surrounding area until relief by the 101st Airborne Division.After Sargat was taken, Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and CIA paramilitary officers along with their Kurdish allies pushed south towards Tikrit and the surrounding towns of Northern Iraq. Previously, during the Battle of the Green Line, Bravo Company, 3/10 with their Kurdish allies pushed back, destroyed, or routed the 13th Iraqi Infantry Division. The same company took Tikrit. Iraq was the largest deployment of the U.S. Special Forces since Vietnam.Fall of Baghdad (April 2003)Three weeks into the invasion, US-led Coalition forces moved into Baghdad. Units of the Iraqi Special Republican Guard led the defence of the city. The rest of the defenders were a mixture of Republican Guard units, regular army units, Fedayeen Saddam, and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. Initial plans were for Coalition units to surround the city and gradually move in, forcing Iraqi armor and ground units to cluster into a central pocket in the city, and then attack with air and artillery forces.This plan soon became unnecessary, as an initial engagement of armored units south of the city saw most of the Republican Guards assets destroyed and routes in the southern outskirts of the city occupied. On April 5, Task Force 1-64 Armor of the U.S. Armys 3rd Infantry Division executed a raid, later called the Thunder Run, to test remaining Iraqi defenses, with 29 tanks and 14 Bradley armored fighting vehicles advancing to the airport. They met heavy resistance, but were successful in reaching the airport. U.S. troops faced heavy fighting in the airport, and were even temporarily pushed out, but eventually secured the airport.File:Marines in Saddams palace DM-SD-04-12222.jpg|left|altphotograph of three Marines entering a partially destroyed stone palace with a mural of Arabic script|thumb|Marines from Battalion 7th Marines enter a palace during the Battle of BaghdadThe next day, another brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division attacked into downtown Baghdad and occupied one of the palaces of Saddam Hussein in fierce fighting. U.S. Marines also faced heavy shelling from Iraqi artillery as they attempted to cross a river bridge, but the river crossing was successful. The Iraqis managed to inflict some casualties on the U.S. forces near the airport from defensive positions but suffered severe casualties from air bombardment. Within hours of the palace seizure and with television coverage of this spreading through Iraq, U.S. forces ordered Iraqi forces within Baghdad to surrender, or the city would face a full-scale assault. Iraqi government officials had either disappeared or had conceded defeat, and on April 9, 2003, Baghdad was formally occupied by Coalition forces. Much of Baghdad remained unsecured however, and fighting continued within the city and its outskirts well into the period of occupation. Saddam had vanished, and his whereabouts were unknown.On April 10, a rumor emerged that Saddam Hussein and his top aides were in a mosque complex in the Al AzAmiyah District of Baghdad. Three companies of Marines were sent to capture him and came under heavy fire from rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and assault rifles. One Marine was killed and 20 were wounded, but neither Saddam or any of his top aides were found. U.S. forces supported by mortars, artillery, and aircraft continued to attack Iraqi forces still loyal to Saddam Hussein and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. U.S. aircraft flying in support were met with Iraqi anti-aircraft fire. On April 12, by late afternoon, all fighting had ceased. A total of 34 American soldiers and 2,320 Iraqi fighters were killed.File:SaddamStatue.jpg|thumb|upright|The April 2003 toppling of Saddam Husseins statue in Square in Baghdad shortly after the capture of the cityMany Iraqis celebrated the downfall of Saddam by vandalizing the many portraits and statues of him together with other pieces of his of personality. One widely publicized event was the dramatic toppling of a large statue of Saddam in Baghdads Square. This attracted considerable media coverage at the time. As the British Mirror reported, For an oppressed people this final act in the fading daylight, the wrenching down of this ghastly symbol of the regime, is their Wall moment. Big Moustache has had his day.(Anton Antonowicz, Toppling Saddams Statue Is The Final Triumph For These Oppressed People in The Mirror, April 10, 2003.)As Staff Sergeant Brian Plesich reported in On Point: The United States Army in Operation Iraqi Freedom,The Marine Corps colonel in the area saw the Saddam statue as a target of opportunity and decided that the statue must come down. Since we were right there, we chimed in with some loudspeaker support to let the Iraqis know what it was we were attempting to do...Somehow along the way, somebody had gotten the idea to put a bunch of Iraqi kids onto the wrecker that was to pull the statue down. While the wrecker was pulling the statue down, there were Iraqi children crawling all over it. Finally they brought the statue down(Staff Sergeant Brian Plesich, team leader, Tactical Psychological Operations Team 1153, 305th Psychological Operations Company, interview by Lieutenant Colonel Dennis Cahill, May 31, 2003 in Col. Gregory Fontenot, Lt. Col. E.J. Degen, and Lt. Col. David Tohn: On Point: The United States Army in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Chapter 6 Regime Collapse)The fall of Baghdad saw the outbreak of regional, sectarian violence throughout the country, as Iraqi tribes and cities began to fight each other over old grudges. The Iraqi cities of Al-Kut and Nasiriyah launched attacks on each other immediately following the fall of Baghdad to establish dominance in the new country, and the U.S.-led Coalition quickly found themselves embroiled in a potential civil war. U.S.-led Coalition forces ordered the cities to cease hostilities immediately, explaining that Baghdad would remain the capital of the new Iraqi government. Nasiriyah responded favorably and quickly backed down; however, Al-Kut placed snipers on the main roadways into town, with orders that invading forces were not to enter the city. After several minor skirmishes, the snipers were removed, but tensions and violence between regional, city, tribal, and familial groups continued.U.S. General Franks assumed control of Iraq as the supreme commander of the coalition occupation forces. Shortly after the sudden collapse of the defense of Baghdad, rumors were circulating in Iraq and elsewhere that there had been a deal struck (a safqua) wherein the U.S.-led Coalition had bribed key members of the Iraqi military elite and/or the Baath party itself to stand down. In May 2003, General Franks retired, and confirmed in an interview with Defense Week that the U.S.-led Coalition had paid Iraqi military leaders to defect. The extent of the defections and their effect on the war are unclear.U.S.-led Coalition troops promptly began searching for the key members of Saddam Husseins government. These individuals were identified by a variety of means, most famously through sets of Iraqi playing cards. Later during the occupation period after the invasion, on July 22, 2003 during a raid by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and men from Force 20, Saddam Husseins sons Uday and Qusay, and one of his grandsons were killed in a massive fire-fight. Saddam Hussein himself was captured on December 13, 2003 by the U.S. Armys 4th Infantry Division and members of Force 121 during Red Dawn.Other areasFile:T-54s, T-55s, Type 59s or Type 69s at Diwaniyah, Iraq.jpg|thumb|The destroyed remains of Iraqi tanks and other armored vehicles litter an Iraqi military complex west of DiwaniyahIn the north, Kurdish forces opposed to Saddam Hussein had already occupied for years an autonomous area in northern Iraq. With the assistance of U.S. Special Forces and air strikes, they were able to rout the Iraqi units near them and to occupy oil-rich Kirkuk on April 10.U.S. special forces had also been involved in the extreme south of Iraq, attempting to occupy key roads to Syria and airbases. In one case two armored platoons were used to convince Iraqi leadership that an entire armored battalion was entrenched in the west of Iraq.On April 15, U.S. forces took control of Tikrit, the last major outpost in central Iraq, with an attack led by the Marines Force Tripoli. About a week later the Marines were relieved in place by the Armys 4th Infantry Division.Bush declares End of major combat operations (May 2003)Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) Mission Accomplished.jpg|thumb|left|The USS Abraham Lincoln returning to port carrying its Mission Accomplished bannerOn May 1, 2003, Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, in a Lockheed Viking, where he gave a speech announcing the end of major combat operations in the Iraq war. Bushs landing was criticized by opponents as an unnecessarily theatrical and expensive stunt. Clearly visible in the background was a banner stating Mission Accomplished. The banner, made by House staff and supplied by request of the United States Navy,() was criticized as premature. The White House subsequently released a statement that the sign and Bushs visit referred to the initial invasion of Iraq and disputing the charge of theatrics. The speech itself noted: We have difficult work to do in Iraq.

Aircraft include Stratotanker, Strike Eagle, Nighthawk, F-16CJ Falcon, British GR-4 Tornado, and Australian HornetThe U.S.-led Coalition forces toppled the government and captured the key cities of a large nation in only 21 days. The invasion did require a large army build-up like the 1991 Gulf War, but many did not see combat and many were withdrawn after the invasion ended. This proved to be short-sighted, however, due to the requirement for a much larger force to combat the irregular Iraqi forces in the aftermath of the war. General Shinseki, U.S. Army Chief of Staff, recommended several hundred thousand(Dave Moniz, USA TODAY, June 2, 2003) troops be used to maintain post-war order, but then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeldand especially his deputy, civilian Wolfowitzstrongly disagreed. Abizaid later said General Shinseki had been right.()The Iraqi army, armed mainly with Soviet-built equipment, was overall ill-equipped in comparison to the American and British forces. Attacks on U.S. supply routes by Fedayeen militiamen were repulsed. The Iraqis artillery proved largely ineffective, and they were unable to mobilize their air force to attempt a defense. The Iraqi T-72 tanks, the most powerful armored vehicles in the Iraqi army, were both outdated and ill-maintained, and when they were mobilized they were rapidly destroyed, thanks in part to the Coalition supremacy. The U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps and Naval Aviation, and British Air Force operated with impunity throughout the country, pinpointing heavily defended resistance targets and destroying them before ground troops arrived. The battle tanks of the U.S. and UK forces, the U.S. Abrams and British 2, proved worthy in the rapid advance across the country. With the large number of RPG attacks by irregular Iraqi forces, few U.S. and UK tanks were lost and no tank crew were killed by hostile fire. The only tank loss sustained by the British Army was a Challenger 2 of the Royal Lancers that was hit by another Challenger 2, killing two crew members.The Iraqi army suffered from poor morale, even amongst the elite Republican Guard. Entire units disbanded into the crowds upon the approach of invading troops, or actually sought out U.S. and UK forces out to surrender. Many Iraqi commanding officers were bribed by the CIA or coerced into surrendering. Worse, the Iraqi army had incompetent leadership  reports state that Hussein, charged with the defense of Baghdad, dramatically shifted the positions of the two main divisions protecting Baghdad several times in the days before the arrival of U.S. forces, and as a result the units within were both confused and further demoralized when U.S. forces attacked. The invasion force did not see the entire Iraqi military thrown against it; U.S. and UK units had orders to move to and seize objective target-points rather than seek engagements with Iraqi units. This resulted in most regular Iraqi military units emerging from the war fully intact and without ever having been engaged by U.S. forces, especially in southern Iraq. It is assumed that most units disintegrated to return to their homes.According to the declassified Pentagon report, The largest contributing factor to the complete defeat of Iraqs military forces was the continued interference by Saddam. The report, designed to help U.S. officials understand in hindsight how Saddam and his military commanders prepared for and fought the invasion, paints a picture of an Iraqi government blind to the threat it faced, hampered by Saddams inept military leadership and deceived by its own propaganda and inability to believe the United States would invade a sovereign country without provocation. According to the BBC, the report portrays Saddam Hussein as chronically out of touch with reality - preoccupied with the prevention of domestic unrest and with the threat posed by Iran.()CasualtiesDeath tollWhile estimates on the number of casualties during the invasion in Iraq vary widely, the majority of deaths and injuries have occurred after U.S. President Bush declared the end of major combat operations on May 1, 2003.(Reuters, Getting amputees back on their feet.Post. Oct. 25, 2005.) According to CNN, the U.S. government reported that 139 U.S. military personnel were killed before May 1, 2003, while over 4,000 have been killed since 2003.( Estimates on civilian casualties are more variable than those for military personnel. According to Iraq Body Count, a group that relies on press reports, NGO-based reports and official figures to measure civilian casualties, approximately 7,500 civilians were killed during the invasion phase, while more than 60,000 civilians have been killed as of April 2007.( ) At the other end of the scale, the Lancet Survey  estimated 654,965 excess deaths to June 2006; and the Opinion Research Business Survey estimated 1,033,000 deaths as a result of the conflict, to April 2009.War crimes and allegationsFedayeen Saddam militia, Republican Guard and Iraqi security forces were reported to have executed Iraqi soldiers who tried to surrender on multiple occasions, as well as threatening the families of those who refused to fight.()()() One such incident was directly observed during the of Debecka Pass.()Many incidents of Fedayeen fighters using shields were reported from various towns in Iraq.() Iraqi Republican Guard units were also reported to be using human shields.( Some reports indicate that the Fedayeen used ambulances to deliver messages and transport fighters into combat. On March 31, Fedayeen in a Crescent-marked ambulance attacked American soldiers outside of Nasiriyah, wounding three.(() During the Battle of Basra, British forces of the Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) reported that on March 28, Fedayeen forces opened fire on thousands of civilian refugees fleeing the city.()()After the ambush of the Maintenance Company during the of Nasiriyah on March 23, the bodies of several U.S. soldiers who had been killed in the ambush were shown on Iraqi television. Some of these soldiers had visible gunshot wounds to head, leading to speculation that they had been executed. Except for Sgt. Walters, no evidence has since surfaced to support this scenario and it is generally accepted that the soldiers were killed in action. Five live prisoners of war were also interviewed on the air, a violation of the Conventions.()() Sergean Walters was initially reported to have been killed in the ambush after killing several Fedayeen before running out of ammunition. However, an eyewitness later reported that he had seen Walters being guarded by several Fedayeen in front of a building. Forensics work later found Walters blood in front of the building and blood spatter suggesting he died from two gunshot wounds to the back at close range. This led the Army to conclude that Walters had been executed after being captured, and he was posthumously awarded the of War Medal in 2004.()() It was alleged in the authorized biography of Pfc. Lynch that she was raped by her captors after her capture, based on medical reports and the pattern of her injuries, though this is not supported by Ms Lynch.() Odeh al-Rehaief, who later helped American forces rescue Lynch, stated that he saw an Iraqi Colonel slap Lynch while she was in her hospital bed.() The staff at the hospital where Lynch was held later denied both stories, saying that Lynch was well cared for.() While Lynch suffers from amnesia due to her injuries, Lynch herself has denied any mistreatment whilst in captivity.Also on March 23, a British Army engineering unit made a wrong turn near the town of Zubayr, which was still held by Iraqi forces. The unit was ambushed and Sapper Luke Allsopp and Staff Sergeant Simon Cullingworth became separated from the rest. Both were captured and executed by Iraqi irregular forces. In 2006, a video of Allsopp lying on the ground surrounded by Iraqi irregular forces was discovered.()During the Battle of Nasiriyah, there was an incident where Iraqi irregulars feigned surrender to approach an American Marine unit securing a bridge. After getting close to the Marines, the Iraqis suddenly opened fire, killing 10 Marines and wounding 40.() In response, American forces reinforced security procedures for dealing with prisoners of war.()Marine Sergeant Fernando Padilla-Ramirez was reported missing from his supply unit after an ambush north of Nasiriyah on March 28. His body was later dragged through the streets of Ash-Shatrah and hung in the town square, and later taken down and buried by sympathetic locals. The corpse was discovered by U.S. forces on April 10.()()(Wright, Generation Kill, page 228. Berkley Publishing Group, 2004. ISBN 978-0-399-15193-4)Security, looting and war damageMassive looting took place in the days following the 2003 invasion. According to U.S. officials, the reality of the situation on the ground was that hospitals, water plants, and ministries with vital intelligence needed security more than other sites. There were only enough U.S. troops on the ground to guard a certain number of the many sites that ideally needed protection, and so, apparently, some hard choices were made.File:IraqNationalMuseum.jpg|thumb|A tank guarding the Museum of Iraq following the 2003 invasion of IraqIt was reported that the Museum of Iraq was among the looted sites. The FBI was soon called into Iraq to track down the stolen items. It was found that the initial allegations of looting of substantial portions of the collection were heavily exaggerated. Initial reports asserted a near-total looting of the museum, estimated at upwards of 170,000 inventory lots, or about 501,000 pieces. The more recent estimate places the number of stolen pieces at around 15,000, and about 10,000 of them probably were taken in an inside job before U.S. troops arrived, according to Bogdanos. Over 5,000 looted items have since been recovered.() An assertion that U.S. forces did not guard the museum because they were guarding the Ministry of Oil and Ministry of Interior is disputed by investigator Colonel Bogdanos in his 2005 book Thieves of Baghdad. Bogdanos notes that the Ministry of Oil building was bombed, but the museum complex, which took some fire, was not bombed. He also writes that Saddam Husseins troops set up snipers nests inside and on top of the museum, and nevertheless U.S. Marines and soldiers stayed close enough to prevent wholesale looting.More serious for the post-war state of Iraq was the looting of cached weaponry and ordnance which fueled the subsequent insurgency. As many as 250,000 tons of explosives were unaccounted for by October 2004.() Disputes within the US Defense Department led to delays in the post-invasion assessment and protection of Iraqi nuclear facilities. Tuwaitha, the Iraqi site most scrutinized by UN inspectors since 1991, was left unguarded and was looted.()()Bahrani, professor of Ancient Near Eastern Art History and Archaeology at University, reported that a helicopter landing pad was constructed in the heart of the ancient city of Babylon, and removed layers of archeological earth from the site. The daily flights of the helicopters rattle the ancient walls and the winds created by their rotors blast sand against the fragile bricks. When my colleague at the site, Maryam Moussa, and I asked military personnel in charge that the helipad be shut down, the response was that it had to remain open for security reasons, for the safety of the troops.() Bahrani also reported that in the summer of 2004, the wall of the Temple of Nabu and the roof of the Temple of Ninmah, both sixth century BC, collapsed as a result of the movement of helicopters.( Electrical power is scarce in post-war Iraq, Bahrani reported, and some fragile artifacts, including the Ottoman Archive, would not survive the loss of refrigeration.(Media coverageU.S. media coverageThe U.S. invasion of Iraq was the most widely and closely reported war in military history.() Television network coverage was largely pro-war and viewers were six times more likely to see a pro-war source as one who was anti-war.() New York Times ran a number of articles describing Saddam Husseins attempts to build weapons of mass destruction. The September 8, 2002 article titled U.S. Says Hussein Intensifies Quest for A-Bomb Parts would be discredited, leading The New York Times to issue a public statement admitting it was not as rigorous as it should have been.( )At the start of the war in March 2003, as many as 775 reporters and photographers were traveling as journalists.() These reporters signed contracts with the military that limited what they were allowed to report on.() When asked why the military decided to embed journalists with the troops, Lt. Col. Rick Long of the U.S. Marine Corps replied, Frankly, our job is to win the war. Part of that is warfare. So we are going to attempt to dominate the information environment.()In 2003, a study released by and Accuracy In Reporting stated the network news disproportionately focused on pro-war sources and left out many anti-war sources. According to the study, 64% of total sources were in favor of the Iraq War while total anti-war sources made up 10% of the media (only 3% of US sources were anti-war). The study stated that viewers were more than six times as likely to see a pro-war source as one who was anti-war; with U.S. guests alone, the ratio increases to 25 to 1.()A September 2003 poll revealed that seventy percent of Americans believed there was a link between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of 9/11.() 80% of News viewers were found to hold at least one such belief about the invasion, compared to 23% of PBS viewers.() Turner, founder of CNN, charged that Murdoch was using Fox News to advocate an invasion.() Critics have argued that this statistic is indicative of misleading coverage by the U.S. media since viewers in other countries were less likely to have these beliefs.() A post-2008 election poll by FactCheck.org found that 48% of Americans believe Hussein played a role in the 9/11 attacks, the group concluded that voters, once deceived, tend to stay that way despite all evidence.(Our Disinformed Electorate. By Kathleen Hall Jamieson and Brooks Jackson. FactCheck.org Published December 12, 2008.)Independent media coveragemedia also played a prominent role in covering the invasion. The Indymedia network, among many other independent networks including many journalists from the invading countries, provided reports in a way difficult to control by any government, corporation or political party. In the United States Now, hosted by Goodman has been critical of the reasons for the 2003 invasion and the alleged crimes committed by the U.S. authorities in Iraq.On the other side, among media not opposing to the invasion, Economist stated in an article on the matter that the normal diplomatic toolssanctions, persuasion, pressure, UN resolutionshave all been tried, during 12 deadly but failed years then giving a mild conditional support to the war stating that if Mr Hussein refuses to disarm, it would be right to go to war.()Australian artist Gittoes collected independent interviews with soldiers while producing his documentary To War. The war in Iraq provided the first time in history that military on the front lines were able to provide direct, uncensored reportage themselves, thanks to blogging software and the reach of the internet. Dozens of such reporting sites, known as soldier blogs or milblogs, were started during the war. These blogs were more often than not largely pro-war and stated various reasons why the soldiers and Marines felt they were doing the right thing.()International media coverageInternational coverage of the war differed from coverage in the U.S. in a number of ways.The Arab-language news channel Jazeera and the German satellite channel Welle featured almost twice as much information on the political background of the war.(International comparison of TV news coverage of Iraq.) Al Jazeera also showed scenes of civilian casualties which were rarely seen in the U.S. media.CriticismOpponents of military intervention in Iraq have attacked the decision to invade Iraq along a number of lines, including calling into question the evidence used to justify the war, arguing for continued diplomacy, challenging the wars legality, suggesting that the U.S. had other more pressing security priorities, (i.e. Afghanistan and Korea) and predicting that the war would destabilize the Middle East region. The breadth and depth of the criticism was particularly notable in comparison with the first Gulf War, which met with considerably less domestic and international opposition, although the geopolitical situation had evolved since the last decade.Rationale based on faulty evidenceThe central U.S. justification for launching the Iraq War was that Saddam Husseins alleged development of nuclear and biological weapons and purported ties to al-Qaeda made his regime a grave and growing() threat to the United States and the world community.() During the lead-up to the war and the aftermath of the invasion, critics cast doubt on the evidence supporting this rationale. Concerning Iraqs weapons programs, prominent critics included Ritter, a former U.N. weapons inspector who argued in 2002 that inspections had eliminated the nuclear and chemical weapons programs, and that evidence of their reconstitution would have been eminently detectable by intelligence services . Although it is popularly believed that Saddam Hussein had forced the IAEA weapons inspectors to leave Iraq, they were in fact withdrawn at the request of US Ambassador Peter Burleigh in advance of Desert Fox, the 1998 American bombing campaign.  After the build-up of U.S. troops in neighboring states, Hussein welcomed them back and promised complete cooperation with their demands. Experienced IAEA inspection teams were already back in Iraq and had made some interim reports on its search for various forms of WMD.()()()()() C. Wilson, an American diplomat investigated the contention that Iraq had sought uranium for nuclear weapons in Niger and reported that the contention had no substance.(Pitt, William R. War On Iraq: What Team Bush Doesnt Want You to Know. 2002, Context Books, New York. ISBN 978-1-893956-38-4.)()Similarly, alleged links between Iraq and al-Qaeda were called into question during the lead up to the war, and were discredited by an October 21, 2004 report from U.S. Senator Levin, which was later corroborated by an April 2006 report from the Defense Departments inspector general.(Jehl, Douglas. Pentagon official distorted intelligence, report says. International Herald Tribune, October 22, 2004. Retrieved on April 18, 2007.) These reports further alleged that Bush Administration officials, particularly former undersecretary of defense J. Feith, manipulated evidence to support links between al-Qaeda and Iraq.(Pincus, Walter and R. Jeffrey Smith. Officials Key Report on Iraq is Faulted. The Washington Post, Friday, February 9, 2007; Page A01)Lack of a U.N. mandateOne of the main questions in the lead-up to the war was whether the Nations Security Council would authorize military intervention in Iraq. When it became increasingly clear that U.N. authorization would require significant further weapons inspections, and that the U.S. and the UK planned to invade Iraq regardless, many criticized their effort as unwise, immoral, and illegal. Cook, then the leader of the United Kingdom House of Commons and a former foreign secretary, resigned from Tony Blairs cabinet in protest over the UKs decision to invade without the authorization of a U.N. resolution. Cook said at the time that: In principle I believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support. In practice I believe it is against Britains interests to create a precedent for unilateral military action.(Tempest, Matthew. Cook resigns from cabinet over Iraq. The Guardian, March 17, 2003. Retrieved on April 17, 2007.)In addition, senior government legal advisor Wilmshurst resigned, stating her legal opinion that an invasion would be illegal.Nations Secretary-General Annan said in an interview with the BBC in September 2004, From our point of view and from the Charter point of view war was illegal.() This drew immediate criticism from the United States and was immediately played down.() His annual report to the General Assembly for 2003 included no more than the statement: Following the end of major hostilities which resulted in the occupation of Iraq...() A similar report from the Security Council was similarly terse in its reference to the event: Following the cessation of hostilities in Iraq in April 2003...() However, some argue that Kofi Annan was simply picking sides and playing politics. The United Nations Security Council has passed nearly 60 resolutions on Iraq and Kuwait since Iraqs invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The most relevant to this issue is Resolution 678, passed on November 29, 1990. It authorizes member states co-operating with the Government of Kuwait...to use all necessary means to (1) implement Security Council Resolution 660 and other resolutions calling for the end of Iraqs occupation of Kuwait and withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti territory and (2) restore international peace and security in the area. However, the phrase restore international peace and security in the area was widely understood to refer to Iraqs invasion of Kuwait and was not a blank check for future military aggression against Iraq.Military intervention vs diplomatic solutions:fr:Discours prononc  lONU lors de la crise irakienne - 14 fvrier 2003Dominique de Villepins speech at the U.N. Security Council (February 14, 2003)Criticisms about the evidence used to justify the war notwithstanding, many opponents of military intervention objected, saying that a diplomatic solution would be preferable, and that war should be reserved as a truly last resort. This position was exemplified by French Foreign Minister de Villepin, who responded to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powells February 5, 2003 presentation to the U.N Security Council by saying that: Given the choice between military intervention and an inspections regime that is inadequate because of a failure to cooperate on Iraqs part, we must choose the decisive reinforcement of the means of inspections.(Nations take sides after Powells speech. CNN.com, February 6, 2003. Retrieved April 17, 2006. )The direct opposition between diplomatic solution and military intervention involving France and the United States which was impersonated by Chirac versus Bush and later Powell versus de Villepin, became a milestone in the relations. Anti-French propangada exploiting the classic Francophobic clichs immediately ensued in the United States and the United Kingdom. A call for a boycott on French wine was launched in the United States and the York Post covered on the 1944 Sacrifice of the GIs France would had forgotten. It was followed a week later, on February 20, by the British newspaper The Sun publishing a special issue entitled Chirac is a worm and including hominem attacks such as Jacques Chirac has become the shame of Europe.(20 heures le journal : mission du 20 fvrier 2003 (National Audiovisual Institute archives), French news national edition, France 2 French public channel, February 20, 2003) Actually both newspapers expressed the opinion of their owner, U.S. billionaire Murdoch, a military intervention supporter and a George W. Bush partisan as argued by Greenslade in Guardian published on February 17.(()Distraction from the war on terrorism and other prioritiesBoth supporters and opponents of the Iraq War widely viewed it within the context of a postSeptember 11 world, where the U.S. has sought to make terrorism the defining international security paradigm. Bush often describes the Iraq War as a central front in the on terror.(Office of the Press Secretary. President Addresses Nation, Discusses Iraq, War on Terror. White House Press Release, June 28, 2005. Retrieved on April 17, 2007.) Some critics of the war, particularly within the U.S. military community, argued pointedly against the conflation of Iraq and the war on terror, and criticized Bush for losing focus on the more important objective of fighting al-Qaeda. As Marine Lieut. General Newbold, the Pentagons former top operations officer, wrote in a 2006 TIME article, I now regret that I did not more openly challenge those who were determined to invade a country whose actions were peripheral to the real threatal-Qaeda.(Newbold, Greg. Why Iraq Was a Mistake. Time Magazine, April 9, 2006. Retrieved on April 16, 2007.)Critics within this vein have further argued that containment would have been an effective strategy for the Hussein government, and that the top U.S. priorities in the East should be encouraging a solution to the conflict, working for the moderation of Iran, and solidifying gains made in Afghanistan and Central Asia. In an October 2002 speech, Retired Marine Gen. Zinni, former head of Central Command for U.S. forces in the Middle East and State Departments envoy to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, called Iraq maybe six or seven, in terms of U.S. Middle East priorities, adding that the affordability line may be drawn around five.(Boehlert, Eric. Im not sure which planet they live on. Salon, October 17, 20002. Retrieved April 17, 2007.) However, while commander of CENTCOM, Zinni held a very different opinion concerning the threat posed by Iraq. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2000, Zinni said: Iraq remains the most significant near-term threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf region. This is primarily due to its large conventional military force, pursuit of WMD, oppressive treatment of Iraqi citizens, refusal to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR), persistent threats to enforcement of the No Fly Zones (NFZ), and continued efforts to violate UN Security Council sanctions through oil smuggling.()  However, it is important to note that Zinni specifically referred to the Persian Gulf region in his Senate testimony, which is a significantly smaller region of the world than the Middle East, which he referred to in 2007.Potential to destabilize the regionBesides arguing that Iraq was not the top strategic priority in the war on terrorism or in the Middle East, critics of the war also suggested that it could potentially destabilize the surrounding region. Prominent among such critics was Scowcroft, who served as National Security Advisor to H. W. Bush. In an August 15, 2002 Street Journal editorial entitled Dont attack Saddam, Scowcroft wrote that, Possibly the most dire consequences would be the effect in the region... there would be an explosion of outrage against us... the results could well destabilize Arab regimes, and, could even swell the ranks of the terrorists.(Scowcroft, Brent. Dont attack Saddam. The Wall Street Journal, August 15, 2002. Retrieved April 17, 2007.)Related phrasesThis campaign featured a variety of new terminology, much of it initially coined by the U.S. government or military. The military official name for the invasion was Operation Iraqi Liberation (White House Press Release). However this was quickly changed to Operation Iraqi Freedom. Also notable was the usage squads to refer to Fedayeen paramilitary forces. Members of the Saddam Hussein government were called by disparaging nicknames  e.g., Chemical Ali (Hassan al-Majid), Baghdad Bob or Comical Ali (Saeed al-Sahaf), and Mrs. Anthrax or Chemical Sally (Salih Mahdi Ammash).Terminology introduced or popularized during the war include:* of evil, originally used by Bush during a of the Union address on January 29, 2002 to describe the countries of Iraq, Iran and North Korea.()* of the willing, a term that originated in the Clinton era (e.g., interview, Clinton, ABC, June 8, 1994), and used by the Bush Administration to describe the countries contributing troops in the invasion, of which the U.S. and UK were the primary members.* Decapitating the regime, a euphemism for killing Saddam Hussein.* Embedding, United States practice of assigning civilian journalists to U.S. military units.* of all bombs, a bomb developed and produced to support Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Its name echoes Saddams phrase Mother of all battles to describe the first War.()* Europe, Rumsfelds term used to describe European governments not supporting the war: Youre thinking of Europe as Germany and France. I dont. I think thats old Europe.* change, a euphemism for overthrowing a government.* and Awe, the strategy of reducing an enemys will to fight through displays of overwhelming force.Many slogans and terms coined came to be used by Bushs political opponents, or those opposed to the war. For example, in April 2003 Kerry, the Democratic candidate in the presidential election, said at a campaign rally: What we need now is not just a regime change in Saddam Hussein and Iraq, but we need a regime change in the United States.() Other war critics use the name Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL) to subtly point out their opinion as to the cause of the war, such as the song Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL) by Rovics, a popular folk protest singer.See also* popular opinion of invasion of Iraq* contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq* pre-war positions on invasion of Iraq* of Iraq timeline* of Iraq* on the 2003 invasion of Iraq* of the 2003 invasion and occupation of IraqCriticism:* opposition to the 2003 Iraq War* against the 2003 Iraq warIntrigues:* disarmament crisis* UN Security Council and the Iraq war* of the 2003 invasion of IraqLists:* of people associated with the 2003 invasion of Iraq* of aviation accidents and incidents during the Iraq War* of wars and disasters by death tollGeneral:* Doctrine* in the Middle East* policy of the United States* ad bellum* warfare* Nations Charter* on TerrorismNotesReferences* Allen, Mike and Juliet Eilperin.

Perry and the younger brother of Hazard Perry. Matthew Perry received a midshipmans commission in the Navy in 1809, and was initially assigned to the USS Revenge, under the command of his elder brother. Under his brothers command, Matthew was a combatant in Battle of Lake Erie aboard the Flagship Lawrence and the replacement flagship, Niagara.Matthews early career saw him assigned to several ships, including the USS President, which had been in a victorious engagement over a British vessel, HMS Little Belt, shortly before the of 1812 was officially declared. Aboard the USS President he served as aide to Commodore John Rodgers. He transferred to the USS United States, and  saw little fighting in the war after that, since the ship was trapped in port at London, Connecticut. Following the signing of the of Ghent which ended the conflict, he served on various vessels in the Mediterranean. Perry served under Commodore Bainbridge during the Barbary War. He then served in African waters aboard USS Cyane during its patrol off Liberia from 1819-1820. After that cruise, Perry was sent to suppress piracy and the trade in the Indies. Later during this period, while in port in Russia, Perry was offered a commission in the Russian Navy, which he declined.Command assignments, 1820s-1840sOpening of Key WestImage:The Gokoku-ji Bell.jpg|thumb|left|An exact replica of the Gokoku-ji Bell which Commodore (Cdre.)

The original bell was returned to Japan in 1987.Perry commanded the USS Shark, a schooner with 12 guns, from 1821-1825.In 1763, when Britain possessed Florida, the Spanish contended that the Keys were part of Cuba and North Havana. Certain elements within the United States felt that West (which was then named Cayo Hueso, meaning Bone Key) could potentially be the Gibraltar of the West because it guarded the northern edge of the 90 mile (145 km) wide of Florida -- the deep water route between the Atlantic and the of Mexico.In 1815 the Spanish governor in Havana deeded the island of West to Juan Pablo Salas of Saint Augustine. After Florida was transferred to the United States, Salas sold Key West to U.S. businessman John W. Simonton for $2,000 in 1821. Simonton lobbied the Government to establish a naval base on Key West, both to take advantage of its strategic location and to bring law and order to the area.On March 25, 1822, Perry sailed the Shark to Key West and planted the U.S. flag, physically claiming the Keys as United States property.Perry renamed Cayo Hueso Thompsons Island for the Secretary of the Navy Thompson and the harbor Port Rodgers for the president of the Board of Navy Commissioners. Neither name stuck.From 1826-1827 Perry acted as fleet captain for Commodore Rodgers. Perry returned to South Carolina for shore duty in 1828, and in 1830 took command of a sloop-of-war, the USS Concord. He spent the years 1833-1837 as second officer of the New York Navy Yard (later the Navy Yard), gaining promotion to captain at the end of this tour.Father of the Steam NavyPerry had a considerable interest in naval education, supporting an apprentice system to train new seamen, and helped establish the curriculum for the States Naval Academy. He was a vocal proponent of modernizing the Navy. Once promoted to captain, he oversaw construction of the Navys second steam frigate the USS Fulton, which he commanded after its completion. He was called The Father of the Steam Navy,(Sewall, John S. (1905). The Logbook of the Captains Clerk: Adventures in the China Seas, p. xxxvi.) and he organized Americas first corps of naval engineers, and conducted the first U.S. naval gunnery school while commanding Fulton in 1839-1841 off Sandy Hook on the coast of Jersey.Promotion to CommodorePerry received the title of Commodore in June 1840, when the of the Navy appointed him commandant of New York Navy Yard.(Griffis, William Elliot. (1887).  Matthew Calbraith Perry: A Typical American Naval Officer, pp. 154-155.)  The United States Navy did not have ranks higher than captain until 1862, so the title of commodore carried considerable importance.()  Officially, an officer would revert to his permanent rank after the squadron command assignment had ended, although in practice officers who received the title of commodore retained the title for life, and Perry was no exception.During his tenure in Brooklyn, he lived in Quarters B at Row, a building which still stands today, but is threatened with demolition by the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation.  In 1843, Perry took command of the Squadron, whose duty was to interdict the trade under the Treaty, and continued in this endeavor through 1844.Mexican-American WarIn 1845, Commodore David Connors length of service in command of the Squadron had come to an end. However, the coming of the War persuaded the authorities not to change commanders in the face of the war. Perry, who would eventually succeed Connor, was made second-in-command and captained the USS Mississippi. Perry captured the Mexican city of Frontera, demonstrated against Tabasco and took part in the Expedition. He had to return to Virginia to make repairs and was still there when the amphibious landings at Veracruz took place. His return to the U.S. gave his superiors the chance to finally give him orders to succeed Commodore Connor in command of the Home Squadron. Perry returned to the fleet during the of Veracruz and his ship supported the siege from the sea. After the fall of Veracruz Scott moved inland and Perry moved against the remaining Mexican port cities. Perry assembled the Fleet and captured Tuxpan in April, 1847. In July 1847 he attacked Tabasco personally, leading a 1,173-man landing force ashore and attacking the city from land.(Sewell, p. xxxvi.)The Perry Expedition: Opening of Japan, 1852-1854suishi teitoku kjgaki (Oral statement by the American Navy admiral).png|thumb|Japanese woodblock print of Perry (center) and other high-ranking American seamenIn advance of his voyage to the Far East, Commodore Perry read widely amongst available books about Tokugawa Japan.  His research even included consultation with the increasingly well-known Japanologist Franz von Siebold, who had lived on the Dutch island of Dejima for eight years before retiring to Leiden in the Netherlands.(Sewall, p. xxxviii.)PrecedentsPerrys expedition to Japan was preceded by several naval expeditions by American ships:* From 1797 to 1809, several American ships traded in Nagasaki under the Dutch flag, upon the request of the Dutch, who were not able to send their own ships because of their conflict against Britain during the Wars. Japan limited foreign trade to the Dutch and Chinese at that time, under the policy of sakoku.* In 1837, an American businessman in Canton named W. King saw an opportunity to open trade by trying to return to Japan three Japanese sailors (among them, Otokichi) who had been shipwrecked a few years before on the coast of Washington. He went to Channel with Morrison, an unarmed American merchant ship. The ship was attacked several times, and sailed back without completing its mission.* In 1846, Commander Biddle, sent by the United States Government to open trade, anchored in Bay with two ships, including one warship armed with 72 cannons, but his requests for a trade agreement remained unsuccessful.(Sewell, pp. xxxiv-xxxv, xlix, lvi.)* In 1849, Captain Glynn sailed to Nagasaki, leading at last to the first successful negotiation by an American with Closed Country Japan. James Glynn recommended to the States Congress that negotiations to open Japan be backed up by a demonstration of force, thus paving the way for Perrys expedition.(English Wikipedia on Preble Logbook)First visit, 1852-1853Image:OdaibaView.jpg|thumb|Odaiba battery at the entrance of Tokyo, built in 1853-54 to prevent an American intrusionFile:Shinagawa Baidai cannon.jpg|thumb|One of the cannons of Odaiba, now at the Shrine. 80-pound bronze, bore: 250mm, length: 3830mm.In 1852, Perry embarked from Virginia for Japan, in command of the India Squadron in search of a Japanese trade treaty. Aboard a black-hulled steam frigate, he portedMississippi,Plymouth,Saratoga,andSusquehannaat Harbor near Edo (modern Tokyo) on July 8, 1853. His actions at this crucial juncture were informed by a careful study of Japans previous contacts with Western ships and what could be known about the Japanese hierarchical culture. He was met by representatives of the Shogunate who told him to proceed to Nagasaki, where there was limited trade with the Netherlands and which was the only Japanese port open to foreigners at that time (see Sakoku).Threat of force and negotiationFile:Japanese coastal wooden cannon 1853 1854.jpg|left|thumb|Japanese coastal cannon built by the Daimyos at the Bakufus order for Commodore Perrys arrival. 1853-54.As he arrived, Perry ordered his ships to steam past Japanese lines towards the capital of Edo, and position their guns towards the town of Uraga.(The Perry mission to Japan, 1853 - 1854 by William Gerald Beasley, Aaron Haight Palmer, Henry F. Graff, Yashi Shzan, Ernest Mason Satow, Shuziro Watanabe p.153ff) Perry refused to abide to demands to leave.( He then demanded permission to present a letter from President Fillmore, and threatened to use force if the Japanese boats around the American squadron did not disperse.(Perry attempted to intimidate the Japanese by presenting them a flag and a letter which told them that in case they chose to combat, the Americans would necessarily vanquish them.(Among the items presented to the Japanese were a white flag and a letter from Perry.

The agreement was made with the Shogun, the de facto ruler of Japan.thumb|left|Japanese 1854 print relating Perrys visit.On his way to Japan, Perry anchored off Keelung in Formosa (modern day Taiwan), for ten days. Perry and crew members landed on Formosa and investigated the potential of mining the coal deposits in that area. He emphasized in his reports that Formosa provided a convenient mid-way trade location. Formosa was also very defensible. It could serve as a base for exploration as Cuba had done for the Spanish in the Americas. Occupying Formosa could help the US to counter European monopolization of the major trade routes. President Pierce declined the suggestion, remarking such a remote possession would be an unnecessary drain of resources and that he would be unlikely to receive the consent of Congress.Image:PerryBustShimoda.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Matthew Perry in ShizuokaReturn to the United States, 1855When Perry returned to the United States in 1855, Congress voted to grant him a reward of $20,000 in appreciation of his work in Japan. Perry used part of this money to prepare and publish a report on the expedition in three volumes, titled Narrative of the Expedition of an American Squadron to the Seas and Japan. He was also advanced to the grade of rear-admiral on the retired list (when his health began to fail) as a reward for his services in the Far East.(Sewall, p. lxxxvii.)  Perry was known to have suffered severe arthritis that left him in frequent pain, that on occasion precluded him from his duties.()Last yearsImage:Formosa-map coal.jpg|thumb|left|A map of coal mining on Formosa Island in the Narrative of the Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perrys Expedition to Japan.Perry spent his last years preparing for publication his account of the Japan expedition, announcing its completion on December 28, 1857. Two days later he was detached from his last post, an assignment to the Naval Efficiency Board. He died awaiting further orders on March 4, 1858 in York City, of rheumatism that had spread to the heart, compounded by complications of gout.(Morison, Samuel Eliot. (1967).  Old Bruin Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry p. 431.)Initially interred in a vault on the grounds of Marks Church in-the-Bowery, in New York City, his remains were moved to the Cemetery in Rhode Island on March 21, 1866, along with those of his daughter, Anna, who died in 1839.A diplomatic noteAmong other mementos, Perry presented Queen Victoria with a breeding pair of Chin dogs, previously owned only by Japanese nobility.Perrys flag and legacyflag 1945.jpg|thumb|left|Commodore Perrys flag (upper left corner) was flown from Annapolis to Tokyo for display at the surrender ceremonies which officially ended World War IIA replica of Perrys US flag is on display on board the USS Missouri (BB-63) memorial in Harbor, Hawaii. It is attached to the bulkhead just inboard of the Japanese surrender signing site on the port side of the ship. The original flag was brought from the Naval Academy Museum to Japan for the Japan surrender ceremony and was displayed on that occasion at the request of MacArthur, who was himself a blood-relative of Perry. Some photographs of the signing ceremony show that this flag was actually displayed backwardreverse side showing (stars in the upper right corner). The cloth of the historic flag was so fragile that the conservator at the Museum directed that a protective backing be sewn on it, leaving its wrong side visible; and this was how Perrys 31-star flag was presented on this unique occasion.(Tsustsumi, Cheryl Lee.  Hawaiis Back Yard: Mighty Mo memorial re-creates a powerful history, Star-Bulletin (Honolulu). August 26, 2007.)  Today, the flag is preserved and on display at the Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Maryland.The pattern for the Union canton on this flag is different from the standard 31-star flag then in use. Perrys flag had columns of five stars save the last column which had six stars. Perrys US flag was unique when it was first flown in Tokyo Bay in 1853-1854.  A replica of this historic flag can be seen today on the Surrender Deck of the Battleship Missouri Memorial in Pearl Harbor.  This replica is also placed in the same location on the bulkhead of the veranda deck where it had been initially mounted on the morning of September 2, 1945( by Chief Carpenter Fred Miletich.(Broom, Jack.

Brooke_Westcott
Brooke Foss Westcott (12 January 1825 &ndash; 27 July 1901) was a British bishop, Biblical scholar and theologian, serving as of Durham from 1890 until his death.Early life and educationHe was born in Birmingham. His father, Brooke Westcott, was a botanist. Westcott was educated at King Edward VI School, Birmingham, under Prince Lee, where he became friends with Barber Lightfoot. The period of Westcotts childhood was one of political ferment in Birmingham and amongst his earliest recollections was one of Attwood leading a large procession of men to a meeting of the Political Union in 1831. A few years after this Chartism led to serious disturbances in Birmingham and many years later Westcott would refer to the deep impression the experiences of that time had made upon him.In 1844 Westcott entered College, Cambridge, where he was invited to join the Apostles. He became a scholar in 1846, took Sir Brownes medal for a Greek ode in 1846 and 1847, and the Members Prize for a Latin essay in 1847 and 1849. He took his BA degree in January 1848, obtaining double-first honours. In mathematics he was twenty-fourth wrangler, Todhunter being senior. In classics he was senior, being bracketed with C.B. Scott, afterwards headmaster of School.()Early teaching careerAfter obtaining his degree, Westcott remained in residence at Trinity. In 1849 he obtained his fellowship; and in the same year he was ordained deacon and priest by his old headmaster, Prince Lee, later of Manchester.As well as studying, Westcott took pupils at Cambridge; fellow readers included his school friend Lightfoot and two other men who became his attached and lifelong friends, E.W. Benson and F.J.A. Hort. The inspiring influence of Westcotts intense enthusiasm left its mark upon these three distinguished men; they regarded him not only as their friend and counsellor, but as in an especial degree their teacher and oracle.He devoted much attention to philosophical, patristic and historical studies, but his main interest was in Testament work. In 1851 he published his Norrisian prize essay with the title Elements of the Gospel Harmony.In 1852 he became an assistant master at School, and soon afterwards he married a Miss Whithard. He succeeded in combining with his school duties an enormous amount both of theological research and of literary activity. He worked at Harrow for nearly twenty years under Dr C.J. Vaughan and Dr Butler, but he was never good at maintaining discipline among large numbers.Early theological writingsThe writings which he produced at this period created a new epoch in the history of modern English theological scholarship. In 1855 he published the first edition of his History of the New Testament Canon, which, frequently revised and expanded, became the standard English work on the subject. In 1859 there appeared his Characteristics of the Gospel Miracles.In 1860 he expanded his Norrisian essay into an Introduction to the Study of the Gospels, a work remarkable for insight and minuteness of study, as well as for reverential treatment combined with considerable freedom from traditional lines. Westcotts work for Smiths Dictionary of the Bible, notably his articles on Canon, Maccabees, Vulgate, entailed most careful and thorough preparation, and led to the composition of his subsequent popular books, The Bible in the Church (1864) and a History of the English Bible (1869). To the same period belongs The Gospel of the Resurrection (1866). As a piece of consecutive reasoning upon a fundamental Christian doctrine it attracted great attention. Its width of view and its recognition of the claims of historical science and pure reason were thoroughly characteristic of Westcotts mode of discussing a theological question. At the time when the book appeared his method of apologetic showed both courage and originality, but the excellence of the work is impaired by the difficulty of the style.In 1865 he took his B.D., and in 1870 his D.D. Later he received honorary degrees of DC.L. from Oxford (1881) and of D.D. from Edinburgh (1883). In 1868 Westcott was appointed examining chaplain by Bishop Magee (of Peterborough); and in the following year he accepted a canonry at Peterborough, which forced him to leave Harrow.Regius Professorship of Divinity, CambridgeFor a time he was enthusiastic about a cathedral life, devoted to the pursuit of learning and to the development of opportunities for the religious and intellectual benefit of the diocese. But the Regius Professorship of Divinity at Cambridge fell vacant, and J. B. Lightfoot, who was then Hulsean professor, refused it in favour of Westcott. It was due to Lightfoots support almost as much as to his own great merits that Westcott was elected to the chair on 1 November 1870.He now occupied a position for which he was supremely fitted, at a point in the reform of university studies when a theologian of liberal views, but universally respected for his massive learning and his devout and single-minded character, had a unique opportunity to contribute. Supported by his friends Lightfoot and Hort, he threw himself into the new work with extraordinary energy, sacrificing many of the privileges of a university career in order that his studies might be more continuous and that he might see more of the younger men.LecturesHis lectures were generally on Biblical subjects. His Commentaries on St Johns Gospel (1881), on the Epistle to the Hebrews (1889) and the Epistles of St John (1883) resulted from his public lectures.One of his most valuable works, The Gospel of Life (1892), a study of Christian doctrine, incorporated the materials upon which he was delivered a series of more private and esoteric lectures on week-day evenings. Lecturing was an intense strain to him, but his influence was immense: to attend one of Westcotts lectures was an experience which encouraged those to whom the references to Origen or of Deutz were unintelligible.New Testament textual studiesBetween 1870 and 1881 Westcott was also continually engaged in text critical work for an edition of the New Testament, and, simultaneously, in the preparation of a new text in conjunction with Hort. The years in which Westcott, Lightfoot and Hort could thus meet frequently and naturally for the discussion of the work in which they were all three so deeply engrossed formed a happy and privileged period in their lives.In the year 1881 there appeared the famous Westcott and Hort text of the New Testament, upon which had been expended nearly thirty years of incessant labour.Educational reformerThe reforms in the regulations for degrees in divinity, the formation and first revision of the new theological tripos, the inauguration of the Cambridge Christian mission to Delhi and the subsequent founding of Stephens College, Delhi, the institution of the Church Society (for the discussion of theological and ecclesiastical questions by the younger men), the meetings for the divinity faculty, the organization of the new Divinity School and Library and, later, the institution of the Cambridge Clergy Training School (renamed Westcott House in 1901 in his honour), were all, in a very real degree, the result of Westcotts energy and influence as Regius professor.(http://ely.anglican.org/about/good_and_great/bfwestcott.html, Diocese of Ely Official Website. URL accessed 21 January 2007.) To this list should also be added the Oxford and Cambridge preliminary examination for candidates for holy orders, with which he was from the first most closely identified. The departure of Lightfoot to become Bishop of Durham in 1879 was a great blow to Westcott. Nevertheless, it resulted in bringing him into still greater prominence. He was compelled to take the lead in matters where Lightfoots more practical nature had previously been predominant.Canonry at WestminsterIn 1883 Westcott was elected to a professorial fellowship at Kings. Shortly afterwards, having previously resigned his canonry at Peterborough, he was appointed by the crown to a canonry at Westminster, and accepted the position of examining chaplain to Archbishop Benson.His little edition of the Paragraph Psalter (1879), arranged for the use of choirs, and his admirable lectures on the Apostles Creed, entitled Historic Faith (1883), are reminiscences of his vacations spent at Peterborough. He held his canonry at Westminster in conjunction with the regius professorship. The strain of the joint work was very heavy, and the intensity of the interest and study which he brought to bear upon his share in the labours of the Ecclesiastical Courts Commission, of which he had been appointed a member, added to his burden.Preaching at Abbey gave him a valued opportunity of dealing with social questions. His sermons were generally portions of a series; and to this period belong the volumes Christus Consummator (1886) and Social Aspects of Christianity (1887).Bishop of DurhamIn March 1890 he was nominated to follow in the steps of his beloved friend Lightfoot, who had died in December 1889. He was consecrated on 1 May at Westminster Abbey by Archbishop Thompson (of York), Hort being the preacher, and enthroned at Cathedral on 15 May. The change of work and surroundings could hardly have been greater. But the sudden immersion in the practical administration of a northern diocese gave him new strength. He surprised the world, which had supposed him to be a recluse and a mystic, by the practical interest he took in the mining population of Durham and in the great shipping and artisan industries of Sunderland and Gateshead. Upon one famous occasion in 1892 he succeeded in bringing to a peaceful solution a long and bitter strike which had divided the masters and men in the Durham collieries; and his success was due to the confidence which he inspired by the extraordinary moral energy of his strangely prophetic personality, at once thoughtful, vehement and affectionate. His constant endeavour to call the attention of the Church to the religious aspect of social questions was a special note in his public utterances. He was a staunch supporter of the co-operative movement. He was practically the founder of the Social Union. He continually insisted upon the necessity of promoting the cause of foreign missions, and he gladly gave four of his sons for the work of the Church in India. His energy was remarkable to the very end. But during the last two or three years of his life he aged considerably. His wife, who had been for some years an invalid, died rather suddenly on 28 May 1901, and he dedicated to her memory his last book, Lessons from Work (1901). He preached a farewell sermon to the miners in Durham cathedral at their annual festival on 20 July. Then came a short, sudden and fatal illness.Legacy and influenceWestcott was no narrow specialist. He had the keenest love of poetry, music and art. He was himself no mean draughtsman, and used often to say that if he had not taken orders he would have become an architect. His literary sympathies were wide. He would never tire of praising Euripides, and studied the writings of Browning. He followed with delight the development of science studies at Cambridge. He spared no pains to be accurate, or to widen the basis of his thought. Thus he devoted one summer vacation to the careful analysis of Comtes Politique positive. He studied assiduously The Sacred Books of the East, and earnestly contended that no systematic view of Christianity could afford to ignore the philosophy of other religions. The outside world was wont to regard him as a mystic; and the mystical, or sacramental, view of life enters, it is true, very largely into his teaching. He had in this respect many points of similarity with the Platonists of the 17th century, and with F.D. Maurice, for whom he had profound regard.  An amusing instance of his unworldliness was his observation that, I never went to Derby. Once, though, I nearly did: I happened to be passing through Derby, that very day.(J.A.Gere and John Sparrow (ed.), Geoffrey Madans Notebooks, Oxford University Press, 1981, at page 19)But in other respects he was very practical; and his strength of will, his learning and his force of character made him really masterful in influence wherever the subject under discussion was of serious moment. He was a strong supporter of Church reform, especially in the direction of obtaining larger powers for the laity.He kept himself aloof from all party strife. He describes himself when he says:The student of Christian doctrine, because he strives after exactness of phrase, because he is conscious of the inadequacy of any one human formula to exhaust the truth, will be filled with sympathy for every genuine endeavour towards the embodiment of right opinion. Partial views attract and exist in virtue of the fragment of truth--be it great or small--which they include; and it is the work of the theologian to seize this no less than to detect the first spring of error. It is easier and, in one sense, it is more impressive to make a peremptory and exclusive statement, and to refuse to allow any place beside it to divergent expositions; but this show of clearness and power is dearly purchased at the cost of the ennobling conviction that the whole truth is far greater than our individual minds. He who believes that every judgement on the highest matters different from his own is simply a heresy must have a mean idea of the faith; and while the qualifications, the reserve, the lingering sympathies of the real student make him in many cases a poor controversialist, it may be said that a mere controversialist cannot be a real theologian (Lessons from Work, pp. 84-85).His theological work was always distinguished by the place which he assigned to Divine Revelation in Holy Scripture and in the teaching of history. His own studies have largely contributed in England to their current understanding of the doctrines of the Resurrection and the Incarnation. His work in conjunction with Hort upon the Greek text of the New Testament will endure as what is thought to be one of the greatest achievements of English Biblical criticism. The principles which are explained in Horts introduction to the text had been arrived at after years of elaborate investigation and continual correspondence and discussion between the two friends.

Dominion_War
The Dominion War is an extended plot concept developed in a number of arcs of  Trek: Deep Space Nine, an American science-fiction television series produced by Pictures.  In the fictional Trek universe, the Dominion War is a conflict between the forces of the Dominion, Union and, later, the Breen Confederacy against the Quadrant alliance of the Federation of Planets, Empire and, later, the Star Empire.The primary setting of much of the series is aboard the fictional Starfleet controlled space station Deep Space Nine, located above the planet Bajor. In the series this space station is situated near a wormhole which provided instantaneous travel to the Quadrant, a region on the other side of the galaxy. During season two of Deep Space Nine, the Dominion is introduced. Over the course of season two and three more information is introduced, until the conflict escalated in season four, particularly in the episodes Homefront and Paradise Lost. The Dominion War arcs present themes that challenge the values of the characters in a manner not attempted in earlier series of Star Trek, and have received a mixed critical response. Developing the plot of the Dominion War also altered the manner in which the series was scripted, shifting the emphasis from an episodic to a serialized narrative format.SynopsisIn Emissary, the pilot episode, the Federation of Planets dispatches Commander Benjamin Sisko to take command of the space station Deep Space Nine.() The station is located near a stable wormhole located in the Quadrant, which leads to the Quadrant of the Milky Way Galaxy, nearly 70,000 light years away. Deep Space Nine is moved from the orbit of the planet Bajor to the Alpha Quadrant terminus of the wormhole to lay claim. Starships begin to enter the wormhole to explore, colonize and trade. The crews on the ships were unaware that they are entering a region of space controlled by the Dominion, a union of planets ordered by force and intimidation.(Deep Space Nines Ferengi bartender, Quark, makes contact with the Vorta, a Dominion member race. However, he and Sisko are captured by the JemHadar, the soldiers of the Dominion. The Alpha Quadrant group is rescued, but the Federation ship USS Odyssey is lost in the attempt to return home, and colonies are destroyed as a warning not to re-enter Dominion space. Later, it is revealed that a race of shapeshifters, known as Founders, are the rulers of the Dominion, and that Constable Odo is of this species. Members of the Cardassian Order and the Romulan Shiar intelligence factions plan to eradicate the Founders and their homeworld, but are themselves deceived by a shapeshifter and ambushed.The Founders initiate a campaign of sabotage and terror against the Alpha Quadrant, which leaves many governments fearful of infiltrators, who are able to assume any physical form. When Earth is attacked, a band of Starfleet officers illegally attempt to impose law at the heart of the Federation. The Empire invades Cardassia in the inaccurate assumption that the Dominion is influencing its government. Later, the Federation suspects the Klingon Chancellor, Gowron, of being a shapeshifter. This turned out to be a ploy by the Dominion so that the Federation would assassinate Gowron and further intensify the rift between the Federation and Klingons due to the Klingon invasion of Cardassia. During the assassination attempt, the Federation realized that Klingon Martok was the actual shapeshifter. It would turn out that Martok, Dr. Bashir and others have been held captive at a prison camp in the Gamma Quadrant while shapeshifters took their place in the Alpha Quadrant. Shortly before their escape, the Dominion succeeds in urging the Cardassians to enter an alliance during the confusion, establishing its presence in the Alpha Quadrant. Realizing the danger, the Federation and Klingons join forces to slow the Dominion build-up, co-operating to plant a minefield across the entrance to the Bajoran Wormhole as a rescued Martok is assigned as a permanent Klingon commander at Deep Space Nine.Nevertheless, the Dominion begins to advance, and seizes control of Deep Space Nine. After a brief retreat, Sisko executes a successful return to the space station, but the wider conflict continues. More setbacks hinder the Alpha Quadrant alliance as additional races, such as the Breen, offer their support to the Dominion. Questionable tactics are adopted in the search for victory, including the dissemination of an engineered virus among the Founders by a shadow Federation group called 31. A ruse involving a murder is used to enlist the help of the Romulans against the Dominion, and dissatisfactions lead the Cardassian leader, Damar, to launch a successful resistance movement against his former Dominion comrades. Eventually, the Dominion is forced back to the planet Cardassia Prime where it is cut off from reinforcements. The female shapeshifter in command informs Odo that they would fight to the end in order to prevent any counter-attack by the alliance into the Gamma Quadrant. Odo assures her that the Federation would not do that while the other parties would be too weak to. After linking together, Odo cures the female shapeshifter of the biological disease afflicting her and the other Founders with the antidote he received and the Dominion agrees to surrender.ConceptionIn 2002, Trek: Deep Space Nine producer Steven Behr stated that unlike some plots, which originated from a single small idea, the creation of the Dominion villain and arc was very much thought out.() Behr said that the earliest mention of the Dominion was purposely planted in the comic Season Two Ferengi episode, Rules of Acquisition, to leave the audience with an impression of how important could it be? It was decided that the Quadrant would need an ambiance that would distinguish it from the Alpha Quadrant. The producers wanted to portray the region as something other than uncharted space, and avoid imitating the adventures of Trek: The Next Generation with another series of plots focusing primarily on themes of exploration.() After 18 months of Deep Space Nine exposition, the producers decided to characterize The Dominion as anti-Federation. Writer and script editor Hewitt Wolfe has explained that this move also distinguished Deep Space Nine from its successor series, Trek: Voyager, which stars a lost Federation ship traversing the chaotic and divided Quadrant of the Way.(Instead of introducing one alien race, three were introduced simultaneously: the Changelings, the Vorta and the JemHadar. These three were intended to represent the front of an ancient civilization coupled together by fear, to contrast with the unity of the Federation enabled by bonds of friendship. Behr, Wolfe, writer Allan Fields and Jim Crocker attended meetings to develop the concepts of these species and found general inspiration in Asimovs Foundation Trilogy novels.() Executive producer Piller suggested the idea that the Founders of the Dominion be the race to which Odo belongs, toward the end of Season Two production, and discovered that Behr and Wolfe had also discussed this possibility.(() This character had been introduced with no knowledge of his true origins. Piller asserts the endeavor to create a new villain was one of the most difficult tasks he undertook in his work on Star Trek.( Wolfe perceives similarities between the fictional Founders and the Empire, in that the species first uses diplomacy, deception and cultural imperialism to achieve their aims before ultimately resorting to coercion.( Hewitt Wolfe: Founders, like the Roman Empire would rather take over someplace without firing a shot, but theyre going to take over ...)According to writer D. Moore, co-creator Berman originally intended the Dominion War to be the focus of three or four episodes, but Behr intended to expand the plotline all along. Moore has stated that Berman sometimes questioned the writing staff about the degree of violence included in some episodes. Berman also expressed concern about the portrayal of long-term consequences for the main characters, such as the loss of a characters leg in Season Seven. The writers argued in favor of the increased violence, asserting that it was justified in view of the plotlines detailing the progression of the Dominion War.() Piller supported the idea that the repercussions of past episodes should continue to be felt, and that characters should learn that actions have consequences, even if such consequences were to lead off in directions Piller had not originally imagined when Deep Space Nine remained in the conceptual stages.(Piller: A Bold New Beginning Featurette Trek: Deep Space Nine Season One DVD Special Features.)( Moore has stated that the filming of Star Trek: Voyager occupied more of Berman and Pillers time from Deep Space Nines third season, which allowed Behr to defend his creative decisions more successfully.() Following the completion of Star Trek: The Next Generation, the writing staff could dedicate more time to working on scripts for Deep Space Nine. The writers admired the scripting techniques used for Trek: The Original Series: Moore cites the 1967 episode of Mercy as a strong influence on his treatment of the Dominion War.()DevelopmentThe plot of the Dominion War is presented in a succession of shorter arcs which span Seasons Two to Seven of Trek: Deep Space Nine and are linked editorially by the decisions of the producers and writers.Season Two: introducing the DominionAfter conceptual meetings, the writers began to introduce allusions to the Dominion into episodes of Season Two. The intention was to gradually increase the audiences awareness that there was a large and pervasive polity at work behind apparently innocuous events in the Quadrant. The Dominion and its methods are revealed across three episodes of the season.()Rules of Acquisition marks the first mention of the Dominion,() when the Ferengi character Quark hears whispers of a powerful union of civilizations in the Gamma Quadrant with which he may be able to trade. Dialogue that seems inconsequential within the framework of a light-hearted episode was planned to ultimately create major change in the dynamics of Trek: Deep Space Nine.(As Alpha Quadrant races begin to colonize planets in the Gamma Quadrant and their presence becomes known, disturbing reports indicate that what the Dominion cannot attain through trade is forcibly seized. These reports are justified in Sanctuary, when a large fleet of Skrreea ships appears in the Alpha Quadrant, in search of a new homeworld in light of the conquest of their original planet by Dominion forces.() The actions of the Dominion are contrasted with the reactions of the regular characters to the Skrreea refugees. Executive producer Piller has suggested that the plot evoked real-world debate surrounding 187, a Californian law concerning the rights of illegal aliens.()The finale of Season Two, JemHadar, permitted writer Hewitt Wolfe to surprise the audience, and challenge their opinions concerning the safety of the Federation and Starfleet, when the USS Odyssey, a Galaxy-class starship similar to the USS Enterprise from Trek: The Next Generation, is outfought and destroyed.(( Hewitt Wolfe: We wanted to show the long-term fans how dangerous these guys were. And its my belief that if that had been the Enterprise and not the Odyssey, and Jean-Luc Picard rather than Keogh in command, it still wouldnt have survived.) The Dominion is revealed to be a ruthless empire, using and stick methods to control others, with three distinct races performing crucial roles.(Interview with Hewitt Wolfe: The Birth of the Dominion and Beyond Documentary Trek: Deep Space Nine Season Three DVD Special Features. Paramount, ASIN: B00008KA5A, June 3, 1993: The Gamma Quadrant isnt empty, it isnt just a bunch of planets. Its bound together by the Dominion, a very, very tough, very smart, very old civilization, run by the mysterious Founders, who are experts in genetic engineering, and who turn out to be Odos people, the shapeshifters. They then go and engineer these slave races that do their bidding. Essentially, the two main slave races were the carrot and the stick. The carrot being the Vorta, who would come to your planet and say, Hey, youre nice people, heres some M16s and some popcorn, and whatever else you want, baby: alcohol, fire-water? All you have to do is sign this little contract and well make you cool. Then theres the JemHadar. So the Vorta say, Oh, you dont want to play ball? Then meet these guys. Theyre gonna kick your asses.) The Dominions JemHadar troops capture Commander Sisko, Quark and an alien named Eris, who is later identified as a agent and one of the Vorta, the Dominions negotiators and administrators. The JemHadar send a JemHadar representative to Deep Space Nine with the message that no further intrusions into Dominion space will be tolerated, and to hand Major Kira Nerys a list of colonies and ships already eliminated for trespassing. The Federation dispatches a rescue team that returns Siskos group to the station, but while retreating back to the Alpha Quadrant a JemHadar ship launches a kamikaze run against the Odyssey, resulting in the destruction of both ships.()Season Three: introducing the FoundersWith the third season, D. Moore and others started to write regularly for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine following the completion of Trek: The Next Generation.( Hewitt Wolfe joined Steven Behr in scripting episodes developing the Dominion plotline, beginning with The Search. Behr became full executive producer at the midpoint of the season, after the departure of Piller.In the two-part season opener, The Search, Commander Sisko returns from Starfleet Headquarters on Earth with a Defiant-class prototype starship, the USS Defiant.( Executive producer Berman had to be convinced that the introduction of the Defiant would not distract the audience from the main starship of the latest Trek production, Trek: Voyager. The decision was made on the basis that a ship was needed to provide an avenue for stories set off the Deep Space Nine space station, and that such a vessel would need the potential to oppose the JemHadar, who had already been portrayed obliterating large ships. Audience research had also suggested that young male viewers were hoping for more action-oriented episodes with greater jeopardy.()Season Threes Dominion stories explore the connection between Odo and his people, and their conflicting attitudes toward solid sentient lifeforms. The Defiant enters the Quadrant on a peace mission to locate the Founders in The Search, and it is discovered that the Founders are of the same race as Odo. Despite a burning desire to return to his home, he finds his peoples philosophy  that which you can control cannot hurt you  abhorrent, and asks to return to the Alpha Quadrant.( Act 5, Scene 74. Writer: Steven Behr. Story: Hewitt Wolfe and Ira Steven Behr. July 18, 1994. Female Changeling: What you can control cant hurt you. Odo: How can you justify the deaths of so many people? Female Changeling: The solids have always been a threat to us, thats the only justification we need.) The Founders, led by a character identified only as the Changeling, acquiesce to Odos request in the hope that he will ultimately rejoin them.()()Another facet to the Dominion was evaluated more closely in Season Three  the JemHadar. In The Abandoned, a juvenile JemHadar is found alone and matures under Odos guidance. The crew of Deep Space Nine witnesses the JemHadars difficulty in adjusting to a society with rules different to those of his native culture. Brooks, directing this episode, has emphasised the story as a metaphor for African-American adolescents in the 20th century and their struggles with addiction and violence, their integration into American society, and the manner in which their upbringing might contribute to these problems.( Brooks: For me, it was very much a story about young brown men, and, to some extent, a story about a society that is responsible for the creation of a generation of young men who are feared, who are addicted, who are potential killers ...) Brooks ensured that Odo continues to support the maturing JemHadar despite the aliens regression to Dominion custom, as a commentary on how modern society should engage with young people.( Brooks: Odo knows that this is still a child, and for him to give up and just let the boy go  what kind of a statement would we be making? That these people are expendable, that we dont really care about them? Those are the hard questions to answer.)Cause initiates a two-part adventure concerning the search for the Founders homeworld which concludes in The Die is Cast.() Following first contact with the Founders, the Order  a covert Cardassian intelligence force  ally themselves with the Shiar, their Romulan counterpart, and launch a secret, pre-emptive strike to destroy the Founders homeworld, hoping that the Founders and the rest of the Dominion will collapse. The Dominion successfully lure the fleets of the Tal Shiar and the Obsidian Order into a trap, eliminating both organizations. The plot establishes an atmosphere of suspicion amongst the Alpha Quadrant powers, initiated by the shapeshifters abilities to assume other identities, which forms the basis of plots for Season Four.()The Season Three finale turned out to differ significantly from the production staffs conceptual vision. Paramount did not favor the idea of a season-end cliffhanger which would have revealed the presence of shapeshifters on Earth. To continue the theme of paranoia about shapeshifters and the Dominion, The Adversary was instead scripted to set up a hunt for a Founder aboard the Defiant, incorporating some narrative elements at first intended to commence Season Four, while offering a more self-contained plot and using existing sets to reduce production costs.()Season Four: Founder infiltration and political destabilizationBerman, Hewitt Wolfe and Steven Behr originally expected to open Season Four with the two-part adventure, postponed from the end of Season Three, that ultimately became Homefront and Paradise Lost. Paramount determined that the writers needed to come up with a much different opener to satisfy the audience, but without giving specific instructions. The production staff decided to begin a plotline based around suspicions between the Federation and the Klingons, finally leading to conflict between the former allies, which was inspired by a line from the Season Three episode The Die is Cast.( Steven Behr: A shapeshifter in that episode says something like, In the future, all we have to worry about is the Klingons and the Federation, and that wont be for much longer. Id said to Ron at the time, You know, we could do a whole show about that ... But the earth didnt move. Nothing shook.) With the Klingons set to reappear, Berman suggested the return of a character from Trek: The Next Generation  the Klingon Worf  as a permanent officer aboard Deep Space Nine.( Steven Behr: Rick Berman said, The Klingons  thats the way to go. Everyone loves the Klingons. And if we bring in the Klingons, why dont we bring back Worf?) While both the new plot and character offered interesting possibilities, the producers felt that their vision for Trek: Deep Space Nine was put off-course for almost one year.( Steven Behr: We only recovered our equilibrium in the middle of the fifth season, following another meeting with the studio in which we said, How about making the Klingons our friends again? Youll see them as much as you want, but we want to get back to the Dominion. While I like having brought Worf onto the show ... I think it had a fairly substantial impact ... It took us way off from where wed intended to go and it was slow going getting back.)Season Four begins with The Way of the Warrior, which marks the arrival of Worf. This episode is one of a few in this season to explore themes of suspicion and paranoia, and their effect upon societies and relationships, building up to Homefront and Paradise Lost. After the events of The Die is Cast, fear about the identities of the infiltrator shapeshifters leads the Klingons to suspect Dominion involvement in the new Cardassian civilian government. Their refusal to break off an invasion, even after Dominion involvement has been disproved, results in a military confrontation and diplomatic breakdown, and the Klingons attempt to seize Deep Space Nine. This seems to further the Founders goal of the destabilization of the Quadrant as a prelude to their own invasion.()In Hippocratic Oath, the characters of Dr. Bashir and Chief OBrien debate curing a group of JemHadar soldiers of an addiction in the hope that they will rebel against the Dominion. There is discussion about the identity of the true enemy, the limits of duty, and whether soldiers are responsible for the actions of their leaders.() To the Death further investigates the themes of soldier duty and loyalty, and contrasts the opposing rules of discipline that regulate Starfleet officers and JemHadar troops. In addition, this episode introduced the Vorta representative Weyoun, who would become the most prominent Vorta in the rest of the series.()In Homefront, the mistrust generated by the shapeshifters continues, with Commander Sisko suspecting his own father and recommending a of emergency be declared on Earth.() In Paradise Lost, some Starfleet officers go further and attempt to implement a dtat against the President of the Federation after it is revealed that shapeshifters have infiltrated Earth and committed a terrorist attack. This leads to an armed conflict between Starfleet vessels for the first time in a century, according to the Star Trek in-universe timeline.() Sisko is able to force Admiral Leyton to abandon his efforts to impose law by telling him, Youre fighting the wrong war!( Act 5, Scene 50. Writers: Steven Behr and Hewitt Wolfe. Story: D. Moore. Revised November 14, 1995. Leyton: Its not over! I have enough loyal officers to make a fight of it! Sisko: Who will you fight? Starfleet? The Federation? Dont you see, Admiral! Youre fighting the wrong war! And as for your loyal officers, Benteens already abandoned you. And she was closer to you than anyone. Youve lost! Dont make anyone else pay for your mistakes. Leyton: I hope ... youre not the one making the mistake.) Behrs favorite line from the episode is Paradise never seemed so well-armed, highlighting one of many occasions when Deep Space Nine would point out the practical issues revolving around maintaining the peaceful culture of the Federation, and the moral or immoral choices made to achieve this ideal.()Season Five: build-up to all-out warIn the fifth season, the Dominion invasion of the Quadrant gathers pace, appearing in episodes such as Rising, Purgatorys Shadow, Infernos Light, and Blaze of Glory. Hewitt Wolfe and Steven Behr were again responsible for the major Season Five episodes concerning the Dominion.()()()()In the Season Five opener, Apocalypse Rising, Odo discovers that his race are capable of deceiving their own kind as well as solids when he is led to believe that Klingon Chancellor Gowron is a Changeling instead of the General, Martok. This plot was planned to shift the focus of Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes back toward the struggle with the Dominion, which had been postponed in earlier production discussions with Paramount in favor of bringing Worf and a Klingon-based plotline into the series.( Steven Behr: Season Four threw us for a loop, with the whole Klingon thing, and bringing Worf into the show. So the seminal thing about our fifth season opener was that we wanted to get back on the track wed anticipated being on a year earlier. We were moving back toward making the shapeshifters and the Dominion our enemies. Not the Klingons. I didnt want to have the Klingons as our enemies ... We wanted to let people know that we didnt switch horse in midstream. So Apocalypse Rising was an important episode. By having that shapeshifter in there, we were saying, Season Four wasnt a mistake. It wasnt the Klingons turning against us. There was a shapeshifter behind it all along. And thats why we had to do that episode.)()In In Purgatorys Shadow, it is discovered that Dr. Bashir has been kidnapped, imprisoned for weeks and in the interim replaced by a Changeling. The shapeshifter double sabotages efforts to close the Wormhole, and attempts to destroy the Bajoran sun, leaving the path open for Dominion fleets to enter the Alpha Quadrant.( In the following episode, By Infernos Light, the Cardassians become a member of the Dominion, and the Federation and Klingon Empire resolve to cast aside their mutual distrust and unite against the common threat. A garrison of Klingon troops is stationed on Deep Space Nine, under the command of the real General Martok, rescued from Dominion incarceration with Bashir.( In Blaze of Glory, the characters confront the issue of cleansing when the Maquis  a resistance group of former Federation citizens now living in Cardassian space  are hunted down and ask for the assistance of Sisko, who used to criticize their methods.(The Season Five finale, Call to Arms, sets the scene for the commencement of full-scale war between the Dominion and the Federation during the final two seasons of Deep Space Nine. When the Dominion begins to send ships through the Wormhole, the Alpha Quadrant allies build a minefield at its mouth to cut off the supply line. The plot considers whether it is better for the planet Bajor to stand with their Federation friends or remain neutral in the coming war to protect themselves. Sisko persuades them that neutrality is the favorable course.(Season Six: the war ragesSeason Six, charting the turmoil of the Dominion War, faces themes of the moral dilemmas of conflict. New plot elements permitted Trek: Deep Space Nine to examine themes in a manner unlike preceding Trek productions, as characters are forced to re-evaluate their beliefs. The production staff resolved to start the season with a six-episode arc, the first attempted in the history of the Star Trek franchise.Berman originally pictured that the Dominion War would last for a limited number of episodes before a prompt resolution.(: The initial thinking was that we would end Season Five on a cliffhanger with the Federation plunged into war, and then we would come back and do a multi-episode arc, and the war would last that long.) Planning the arc, Steven Behr, D. Moore and the writers conceived a longer chain of first five, then six connected episodes, stretching from Time to Stand to Sacrifice of Angels, as themes increased demands for greater narrative development.()() No writer had previously contributed to a series involving arcs of such length, and Moore, Behr and novice scripting partner, supervising producer Hans Beimler, have all stated that the writing process changed as a result, with more production collaboration and interaction than for earlier seasons of Deep Space Nine.( D. Moore: We broke the six episodes together, but as everybody went off and worked on writing them, things would start to change or shift. It became a much more interactive process than it ever had been before. Because each detail had a domino effect. Wed had that happen before, to a certain extent, but wed never done this many episodes with this many continuing storylines as a single piece. We werent used to the rhythm. It was definitely challenging!)( Hans Beimler: It changed the dynamic of the way we work and it changed the kind of involvement that everybody had. Because Ren Echevarria or Ronald D. Moore would go away to work on an episode, and discover something in the writing process that was going to change everybody elses script. One of them would be coming back all the time saying, You know what guys? We need to re-think. And then wed call in all the troops and re-think the storyline.)( Steven Behr: The guys were coming in saying, What are you writing? Are we gonna do this? Wheres Kira at right now? Whats Odo doing? There were a lot of phone calls, a lot of running into each others offices, a lot of Should this go before this? and Wait a second  does this track? The fact is, the show isnt geared to work like that.) The potential for serialization that Berman had perceived from the start of Deep Space Nine came to fruition as a result of the multiple plotlines accumulating to form the Dominion War.(The return of Dukat as commander of the Dominion-controlled Deep Space Nine enabled the writers to contrast the space station of the audiences imagination to its incarnation as a former Cardassian mining facility. Former resistance fighter Kira is portrayed re-considering her ethical code as she sets out on the path to collaboration in Rocks and Shoals, but the suicide of a Bajoran monk reminds her of the reality of her situation. Through Rocks and Shoals, Deep Space Nine also revisits themes of the war conduct as Sisko considers the morality of ambushing soldiers whom superiors have forsaken, only for events to force his hand.() In Time to Stand and Behind the Lines, the character of Odo is torn between the trust placed in him by Kira and the Bajorans, and his status as a Founder, when he joins Deep Space Nines Dominion council and then neglects to help his comrades at a critical moment.Fortune is reversed again in Season Six as Starfleet re-captures Deep Space Nine in the closing episodes of the opening arc, the Bold and Sacrifice of Angels. The USS Defiant stands alone in an attempt to hold back thousands of Dominion ships entering through the Wormhole. An intervention from the Prophets, considered gods by the Bajorans, leads characters to ponder questions of faith and destiny.() Writer Hans Beimler wished to include mythological allusions, stating, Its tragic hero stuff. A hero Sisko takes on things for others, but doesnt necessarily find any peace himself in the result.() Steven Behr compares Sisko to the Biblical figure, Moses, who fails to reach the Land, and to the character of Ethan Edwards from the 1956 Western film, The Searchers, who neglects to return to his family once his task is complete.( It was determined that this facet to Siskos character justified the use of divine intervention to resolve the Dominion threat:( Steven Behr: ... They Prophets wouldnt have done this for just anyone. This was the man going out into the wilderness and demanding his god to interfere, to do something, for crying out loud. The corporeal characters had done so much in this episode; surely, theyd earned the help of the gods.) the fleet disappears and the Federation regains control of Deep Space Nine. The defeat costs Dukat his mental health, the life of his daughter, Ziyal, and his status as Cardassian leader. Dukat is the first but not the only character in Season Six to face the pain of loss in conflict. Later, in the season six finale of the Prophets, Worf loses his wife Dax when she is killed by Dukat.Although themes of death are apparent in Deep Space Nines previous seasons, Beyond the Stars details how Sisko copes with the loss of a friend on a deeper psychological level. Experiencing visions of himself confronting racial discrimination against Black Americans in the 1950s, Sisko interprets useful parallels connected to his life on Deep Space Nine.() Siskos response to the death toll of the Dominion War is re-examined in the Pale Moonlight.(Additionally, Season Six introduces 31, a secret organization dedicated to preserving the Federations principles regardless of the cost and legitimacy of its methods. In Inquisition, the character of Dr. Bashir refuses to join Section 31 and reports its actions, but still ponders its significance: But what would that say about us? That were no different than our enemies? That when push comes to shove, were willing to throw away our principles in order to survive? Sisko replies, I wish I had an answer for you.()( Act Five, Scene 43. Writers: Thompson and Weddle. January 14, 1998. Revised January 29, 1998. Bashir: I cant believe the Federation condones this kind of activity. Odo: Personally, I find it hard to believe they wouldnt. Every other great power has a unit like Section 31. The Romulans have the Tal Shiar, the Cardassians had the Obsidian Order ... Bashir: But what does that say about us? When push comes to shove, are we willing to sacrifice our principles in order to survive? Sisko: I wish I had an answer for you, Doctor.)In the Pale Moonlight considers a similar moral dilemma when the Dominion captures an important Federation planet, Betazed, in a surprise attack. The subjugation of a planet familiar to the audience was used to heighten the sense of danger and the stakes for the characters.( D. Moore: We wanted a moment that would really galvanize Sisko ... so we needed to have a familiar world fall the war ...) In this episode, Sisko fuels a conspiracy intended to improve the war situation that ultimately results in the character of Garak committing murder. In the context of the Dominion War, it is resolved to conceal the truth for the greater good.()( Act Five, Scene 45. Writer: Michael Taylor. Uncredited contribution: D. Moore. Story: Allan Fields. January 26, 1998. Revised February 11, 1998. Sisko: So ... I lied. I cheated. I bribed men to cover the crimes of other men. I am an accessory to murder. But the most damning thing of all ... I think I can live with it. And if I had to do it all over again, I would. Garak was right about one thing, a guilty conscience is a small price to pay for the safety of the Alpha Quadrant. So I will learn to live with it. Because I can live with it. I can live with it ...) Writer Michael Taylor has suggested, It showed how Deep Space Nine could really stretch the Star Trek formula. It pushes the boundaries in a realistic way, because the decisions Sisko makes are the kinds of decisions that have to be made in war. Theyre for the greater good.(Season Seven: end of the warSeason Seven charts further dilemmas of conflict. Following the example of Season Six, the writers considered using an arc to conclude the multiple Dominion War threads in satisfying fashion, deciding that Trek: Deep Space Nine could not be concluded in one or two episodes alone.(Interview with Hans Beimler, Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion, Pocket Books, 2000: It showed us the possibilities and the excitement that could be garnered, and in the end, we liked it so much that we decided to do the ten-episode arc at the end of the series.)( Berman: So rather than tie up every thread in the few hours, we thought, Why not look at the last third of the season as a continuing, building conclusion to the seven-year story?) A ten-episode arc was outlined to end Season Seven, the Dominion War, and all of Deep Space Nine, and more alterations were made as scripting progressed.( Steven Behr: The show wasnt geared to be what we kept turning it into ... We had to kind of do it and hope it was going to work out ... So we didnt lay it out at the beginning of the year. We planned then as we were doing them. That allowed us to find great stuff, but occasionally it put us into situations where we were saying to each other, Well, what do you want to do with ? I dunno, what do you want to do with them?)Characters face issues of genocide: in Treachery, Faith, and the Great River, Constable Odo learns of the engineered virus that the Federation has disseminated among the Founders,() and in It Rains... that 31 has infected him to communicate the disease.( While Dr. Bashir supports providing the Founders with a cure, others are unconvinced.Another opponent reveals itself in the Breen-Dominion pact enacted in Til Death Do Us Part. For Changing Face of Evil, writers Steven Behr and Hans Beimler scripted a second strike against the Federation through a Breen assault on Earth which sees the destruction of the USS Defiant. D. Moore has stated, We wanted to kill the Defiant as a statement on how tough the Breen were. We thought that would rock the characters and the audience. Behr explains that, ... the ship had become a character that had caught on in peoples hearts and minds ... when the Defiant went down, that hurt.()()The resurgence in the conflict provided opportunities to introduce problems such as post-conflict trauma in Siege of AR-558,() and injury when the character of Nog undergoes leg amputation in Its Only a Paper Moon.() Moore has said that the plot of this episode was agreed on after an extended argument between Behr and Deep Space Nine creator Berman, and that such discussions were a common occurrence when war casualties were considered.( Academic Michele Barrett perceives the allusions made to the traumas of War I.(The concept of resistance is re-opened in the context of Cardassia rather than Bajor. Damar becomes more and more frustrated with the deadlocked conflict and his situation as a Dominion puppet.( Act Five, Scenes 67-71. Writers: Hans Beimler and Steven Behr. February 3, 1999. Revised February 23, 1999. Damar: Seven million of our brave soldiers have given their lives to fulfill our part of the agreement, and what has the Dominion done in return? Nothing. Weve gained no new territories. In fact, our influence throughout the quadrant has diminished. And to make matters worse we are no longer masters in our own home. Travel anywhere on Cardassia and what do you find? JemHadar, Vorta, and now Breen. Instead of the invaders we have become the invaded. Our allies have conquered us without firing a single shot. Well, no longer.) As Cardassian military losses mount, and Dominion control of Cardassia deepens, he becomes alcoholic and criticizes the Dominions power. Damar was originally to be revealed as a agent for the Federation, but Moore then suggested the slave revolt of Spartacus as a model.() Damar establishes an underground movement, is branded a rebel and goes into hiding. Kira, Garak and Odo are sent as technical advisors to help him in When It Rains....()The relationship between Cardassians and Bajorans, former enemies turned allies, is charted in Into the Wind, in which Damar and Kiras group abandon prejudice and collaborate to seize a Breen weapon.() Continuing into The Dogs of War, Damar is forced to choose between his Cardassian comrades, stubborn in their beliefs, and the support of Kira and others whom he used to consider enemies.(Interview with Steven Behr, Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion, Pocket Books, 2000: We needed someone Rusot who would highlight Damars strength, by putting Damar in a position where hed have to hold this tiger by the tail and keep him in line.)() As the tide turns against the Dominion, cut off from the Quadrant and without technological advantage, a last stand is prepared.( The Female Changeling orders the destruction of a metropolis to coerce the Cardassians back into line, but instead the Cardassian fleet defects, passing the advantage to the Quadrant alliance.( Consequently, an attempted extermination results in the deaths of 800 million Cardassians in a Dominion bombardment.()Allusions to genocide contrast with ethical discussion concerning the engineered Founders disease and a potential cure. In Extreme Measures, the characters of Dr. Bashir and Chief OBrien locate a treatment inside the mind of Section 31 agent Luther Sloan. A moral debate ensues on what constitutes genocide. While Bashir supports offering a cure to the Founders, Sisko determines that the disease should be left to continue crippling the powerful opposition. However, in The Dogs of War, Odo declares that this amounts to genocide of his species and is handed a treatment by Bashir.( Act 1, Scenes 20-1. Writers: Echevarria and D. Moore. Story: Allan Fields. Revised April 9, 1998. Odo: Dont split hairs with me, doctor. They used me as an instrument to try to commit genocide. We may be at war with the Founders, but thats no excuse. Bashir: I completely agree. Sisko: I dont condone what Section 31 did, but the Founders started this war, not us. Giving them the cure would only strengthen their hand. And we cant do that  not when there are millions of men and women out there putting their lives on the line every day. Odo: Interesting, isnt it? The Federation claims to abhor Section 31s tactics, but when they need their dirty work done they look the other way. Its a tidy little arrangement, wouldnt you say?) In return for the Dominions peaceful surrender, and the arrest of the Female Changeling on charges of crimes, the Alpha Quadrant alliance permits Odo to heal the rest of his people.()The Treaty of Bajor is signed aboard Deep Space Nine in the Season Seven finale, What You Leave Behind, Part II. The conclusion to the Dominion War arc formed the resolution to Deep Space Nine as a series, and a moment for the production staff to settle the destinies of the main characters. Berman and Behr agreed with Paramount that the final episode of the series should concentrate on human drama rather than the endgame of the Dominion War.( Steven Behr: I could see their point. Deep Space Nine is bigger than just the Dominion War. So we split it. We had a two-hour episode, which allowed us to give the audience the big battle scenes and all that stuff, but then say, Hey, this is the final episode, and we have a lot of other stuff to take care of too! ... I wanted to tie up all the loose ends. I didnt want this show to end like so many TV shows do, with all this open-ended Whatever happened to these characters? I mean, obviously these characters go off and have some kind of life, but in terms of this series, I wanted to bring some closure, it was important to me.) Moore opines the production staff succeeded in ensuring the Dominion War acted as a means of deepening characterization.() Although further plots would have been scripted had Deep Space Nine continued into an eighth season, Behr accepted the resolution of the Dominion War at the end of Season Seven.()ReceptionFormer cast members and production staffIn a 2007 interview with iF magazine, Takei, who played Sulu in Trek: The Original Series and its films, described Trek: Deep Space Nine as representing the polar opposite of Roddenberrys vision and philosophy of the future.() Writer Fontana has stated in an interview that Roddenberry would have admired the later series for its dark themes, referring to Roddenberrys military service record in War II.() Roddenberry doubted that a series concentrating on themes of aside from exploration could endure, and voiced displeasure with initial concepts for Deep Space Nine presented to him in 1991. Berman has explained that Roddenberry, although terminally ill, had given him his blessing for its development, but that he had no opportunity to discuss any of the ideas with Roddenberry.()Critical receptionJohn J. OConnor, writing for New York Times in January 1993, noted that pre-release advertisements for Trek: Deep Space Nine offered a new Star Trek era and added, Welcome to the Dark Side. The determinedly optimistic Mr. Roddenberry was partial to plots that made uplifting moral points. The new creators and executive producers, Berman and Piller, are shooting, so to speak, for something more ambivalent, less perfect.() In September 1996, prior to the start of Season Four, OConnor was not sure the series was tackling contemporary themes adequately. He wrote, Inevitably, though, there is an element of exhaustion seeping through the concept. With the War over, perhaps the Roddenberry optimism seems merely naive as headlines bring news of murderous divisions between Serbs and Muslims, Kurds and Turks, Israelis and Palestinians, Catholics and Protestants, and so on across an increasingly depressing globe. Trek offered a vision that leapt 300 years into the future. For too many people today, three years would seem a stretch.()Cynthia Littleton, writing for Variety in 1998, summarized the ratings the series was receiving at the end of its sixth season: Deep Space Nine may not go out on as high a Nielsen note as Next Generation, which wrapped a hugely successful run in 1994, but DS9 is hardly floundering. The show, which bowed in January 1993, consistently ranks among the top three first-run syndication hours in household and demographic ratings.()In a 1999 edition of the Australian science-fiction magazine Frontier, Anthony Leong suggested that Deep Space Nine had not initially been envisaged to include a war arc from the beginning. He demonstrated a preference for the manner in which the plot of 5 had been devised, while acknowledging how the Deep Space Nine writers had developed a continuing plotline: ... it is rare for a series creator to envision how the series will develop over time. Furthermore, the creative process in dramatic television writing tends to be organic, as events in the series will unfold based on the events that preceded it. For example, were the wars with the Klingons and the Dominion on Deep Space Nine foreseen by its creators back in the first season? Of course not ... these events developed over time through the input of its writing staff.()In 2008, Nader Elhefnawy, contributor to Internet Review of Science Fiction, asserted that, while less appreciated than other science-fiction series of the 1990s, Deep Space Nine had developed an interesting cast of characters, thanks to the Dominion War, much of the richest and most exciting drama in the Star Trek franchises history.()Owen Williams, writing for Empire magazine, opines that Star Trek as a whole has been slow to adapt and develop to new trends, while singling out Deep Space Nine for special mention: ... arguably even the ace DS9 only got good in response to Babylon 5 ...() Adam Smith, chief features writer for Empire commented in a 2009 article that, Its hard to choose the best episodes of DS9 without mentioning the stories involving the Dominion War. He reported The Search, the Pale Moonlight and Beyond the Stars as the features staffs favorite episodes for their portrayal of darker themes and creating a change in direction.()Star Trek: Deep Space Nine was nominated at the of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films for a Award, from 1997 to 2000, in the field of Best Genre Cable or Syndicated Series. It was nominated in technical and artistic categories at the Emmys in each season. Cinescape columnist Andrew Hershberger remarked in 2003 on the lack of critical success for science-fiction television: Nobody cool would dare vote for a sci-fi show Outstanding Drama Series that didnt have Stanley Kubrick or Chris Carters name attached to it ... If Deep Space Nine was involved, youd hear some real complaining on this end.()Academic perspectivesAcademics have noted how the Dominion War plotlines have explored the human psyche as much as outer space. Lincoln Geraghty praises the ending to the arc and Trek: Deep Space Nine as a series, and believes this is indicative of how the series manipulates the Trek ethos, identifying a theme of ambiguity as part of its continuing narrative.() Karin Blair, writing in 1997 at the time of Season Five, felt that the series was reflecting trends for American culture to re-consider its place in the global community.() Social theorist Michele Barrett comments on the declining faith in rationalism that haunts Deep Space Nine in her book Star Trek: The Human Frontier.( Back cover.)In contrast, Robert Jewett and Shelton Lawrence, authors of Myth of the American Superhero, argue that the Dominion War plotlines in Deep Space Nine continue Star Treks portrayal of humanistic militarism, in that conflict is justified for the sake of humanity.() Criticism is levelled at Paramounts tie-in merchandising, in particular the slogan for the computer game Deep Space Nine: Dominion Wars, which is considered to emphasize the combat element at the expense of other themes.()While television commentators and fans have noted associations with the Wars in the 1990s, some academics have noted parallels between the portrayal of the Dominion War and other historical conflicts. Michele Barrett identifies a number of themes relating to War I in Star Trek, especially in the bleak and costly alliances and endless casualty sheets that characterize the protracted Dominion War in DS9.()Spin-off mediaA number of novels, novelizations and short-story collections have been written to chronicle events of the Dominion War outside of canon:* Behind Enemy Lines by Vornholt()* A Call to Arms by R.

West_Wycombe_Caves
West Wycombe Caves (also known as the Hell-Fire Caves) are a network of man-made chalk and flint caverns which extend one quarter of a mile underground, situated above the village of Wycombe, at the southern edge of the Hills near Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, England.They were excavated between 1748 and 1752 for the infamous Dashwood, 15th Baron le Despencer (2nd Baronet), founder of the Society and co-founder of the notorious Fire Club, whose meetings were held within the caves.(Hellfirecaves.co.uk)They have been operating as a tourist attraction since 1951 and have attracted over 2 million visitors since their re-opening. Location The caves run deep into the hillside above West Wycombe village and directly beneath Saint Lawrences Church and Mausoleum (which were also constructed by Sir Francis Dashwood around the same time the caves were excavated). Wycombe Park, ancestral seat of the Dashwood family and also a National Trust property, lies directly across the valley. The caves striking entrance, designed as the faade of a mock gothic church and built from flint and chalk mortar, which would have been erected at around 1752, can be viewed directly from West Wycombe House. Design and Layout The unusual and intriguing design of the caves were much inspired by Sir Francis Dashwoods visits to Italy, Greece, Turkey, Syria and other areas of the Empire during his Tour. The caves extend a quarter of a mile underground, with each individual cave or chamber connected by a series of long, narrow tunnels and passageways.The underground chambers are named, from the Entrance Hall, to the Stewards Chamber and Whiteheads Cave, through Lord Sandwichs Circle (named after Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich), Franklins Cave (named after Franklin, a friend of Dashwood who visited West Wycombe), the Banqueting Hall (allegedly the largest man-made chalk cavern in the world), the Triangle, to the Miners Cave; and finally, across a subterranean river named the Styx, lies the final cave, the Inner Temple (where the meetings of the Hell Fire Club were held), which is said to lie directly 300 feet beneath the church on top of West Wycombe hill. According to Greek mythology, the River Styx separated the mortal world from the immortal world, and the subterranean position of the Inner Temple directly beneath Saint Lawrences Church was supposed to signify Heaven and Hell.An alternative viewpoint was advanced by Daniel P. Mannix in his book about The Hell Fire Club. This theory suggests that the caves had been deliberately created by Dashwood according to a sexual design. The design begins at the womb of the Banqueting Hall, leading to rebirth through the female triangle, followed by baptism in the River Styx and the pleasures thereafter of the Inner Temple. This theory is not mentioned in National Trust literature and is allegedly refuted by the Dashwood family. The flint mining theory is also questionable because the Hills flint bed overlays the chalk escarpment and does not have to be mined except by means of small open flint dells, of which there are many in the area. History of the Caves  Alteration and extension of the Caves A chalk mine of supposedly ancient origin is believed to have existed above West Wycombe for centuries. During the late 1740s, and in an attempt to combat local poverty, Sir Francis Dashwood commissioned an ambitious project to supply chalk for a straight three-mile road between West Wycombe and High Wycombe (then part of the busy London - Oxford trade route, and now the A40 road). Local farm workers, impoverished due to a succession of droughts and failed harvests, were employed at the rate of a shilling per day (enough to sustain a family in the Georgian era) to tunnel beneath ground and mine chalk and flint. The chalk was used to construct the West Wycombe - High Wycombe road as well as being used for building material for the houses in the village and for the church and Mausoleum. Considering they were all dug by hand, the caves are often regarded as an incredible feat of engineering. The Hell-Fire Club File:West Wycombe House, nr. High Wycombe - geograph.org.uk - 193266.jpg|thumb|right|220px|18th century Italianate home of Sir Dashwood, founder of the notorious Club.The caves were used solely as a meeting place for Sir Francis Dashwoods notorious Club, whose members included various politically and socially important 18th century figures such as Hogarth, Wilkes, Thomas Potter and Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. Though not believed to be a member, Franklin was a close friend to Dashwood who visited the caves on more than one occasion. The Hell Fire Club had previously used Medmenham Abbey, eight miles away from West Wycombe and situated on the Thames, as a meeting place, but the caves at West Wycombe were later used for meetings in the 1750s and early 1760s.Sir Francis club was never actually known as a Hell Fire Club - this name was given much later. His club in fact used a number of other names, such as The Brotherhood of St. Francis of Wycombe, Order of Knights of West Wycombe, and The Order of the Friars of St. Francis of West Wycombe. According to Walpole, the members practice was rigorously pagan: Bacchus and Venus were the deities to whom they almost publicly sacrificed; and the nymphs and the hogsheads that were laid in against the festivals of this new church, sufficiently informed the neighbourhood of the complexion of those hermits. Dashwoods garden at West Wycombe contained numerous statues and shrines to different gods; Daphne and Flora, Priapus and the previously mentioned Venus and Dionysus.Meetings occurred twice a month, with an AGM lasting a week or more in June or September. The members addressed each other as Brothers and the leader, which changed regularly, as Abbot. During meetings members supposedly wore ritual clothing: white trousers, jacket and cap, while the Abbot wore a red ensemble of the same style. Many rumours of black magic, satanic rituals and orgies were in circulation when the club was around. Other clubs, especially in Ireland and Scotland, were rumoured to take part in far more dubious activities. Rumours saw female guests (a euphemism for prostitutes) referred to as Nuns. Dashwoods Club meetings often included mock rituals, items of a pornographic nature, much drinking, wenching and banqueting. Disbanding of the Hell-Fire Club The early years of the 1760s saw the downfall of Dashwoods exclusive club.In 1762 the Earl of Bute appointed Dashwood his Chancellor of the Exchequer, despite Dashwood being widely held to be incapable of understanding a bar bill of five figures. (Dashwood resigned the post the next year, having raised a tax on cider which caused near-riots). Dashwood now sat in the of Lords after taking up the title of Baron Le Despencer when the previous holder died. Then there was the attempted arrest of Wilkes for seditious libel against the King in the notorious issue No. 45 of his The North Briton in early 1763. During a search authorised by a General Warrant (possibly set up by Sandwich, who wanted to get rid of Wilkes), a version of The Essay on Woman was discovered set up on the press of a printer whom Wilkes had almost certainly used. The work was almost certainly principally written by Potter, and from internal evidence can be dated to around 1755. It was scurrilous, blasphemous, libellous, and pornographic, unquestionably illegal under the laws of the time, and the Government subsequently used it to drive Wilkes into exile. Between 1760 and 65 Chrysal, or the Adventures of a Guinea by Charles Johnstone was published. It contained stories easily identified with the doings of the Hellfire Club, one in which Lord Sandwich was ridiculed as having mistaken a monkey for the Devil. This book sparked the association between the Medmenham Monks and the Hellfire Club. By this time, many of the Friars were either dead or too far away for the Club to continue as it did before. The Hellfire Club was finished by 1766.Paul Whitehead had been the Secretary and Steward to the Hell Fire Club. When he died in 1774, as his will specified, his heart was placed in an urn at West Wycombe. It was sometimes taken out on display visitors, but was stolen in 1829. Disuse and re-use as a tourist attraction Following the demise of the Hell Fire Club in the 1760s and Sir Francis Dashwoods death in 1781, the caves no longer served a purpose locally and subsequently fell into disrepair, disused from a period between 1780 and the late 1940s.Following the outbreak of the World War and the threat of German aerial bombardment, the caverns had been planned to have been used as a large air-raid shelter if bombing had occurred in the local area, but Buckinghamshires rural geographical position meant that Wycombe and surrounding towns were not an enemy target, and therefore the caves were not in use during this time.During the late 1940s and early 1950s the caves were renovated and turned into a local visitor attraction by the late Sir Francis Dashwood (11th Baronet), who used the profit earned to refurbish the dilapidated West Wycombe Park.West Wycombe Caves have received over 2 million visitors since their re-opening in 1951 and continue to be a popular attraction today. Hauntings The caves have been the source of abundant paranormal interest and many ghost stories. The two most common ghost stories surrounding the West Wycombe Caves are the two listed below; Paul Whitehead Paul Whitehead, a steward and secretary of the Hell Fire Club and close friend to Sir Francis Dashwood, had his heart placed in an elegant marble urn (at the sum of 50) in the Mausoleum by Sir Francis Dashwood, as his will requested. It occasionally was put on display to visitors but was allegedly stolen in 1829 by an Australian soldier. Legend holds that the ghost of Whitehead haunts West Wycombe Caves and Hill, searching for his heart. Numerous visitors and staff have reported seeing a man in alarmingly old-fashioned clothing wandering the passageways. When faced he is said to vanish into thin air. The White Lady  Another well-attested local legend is the tale of Sukie, the White Lady. Legend holds that Sukie (an abbreviation of the name Susan) was a teenage maid at the local George and Dragon Inn during the late 18th century or early 19th century. The sixteen year-old girl was apparently by far the most appealing of the serving staff, and many local men vied for the girls affections. But Sukie had ambitions to marry into society and rejected the advances from all her local admirers. She began dating a local aristocrat, with whom she was very much taken with, and one day a message, purported from her lover, was sent to Sukie at the tavern instructing her to meet him in the caves one night wearing her best white dress as a wedding gown. She arrived, in candlelight and in her white dress as was asked, only to find it was a cruel hoax planted by three village boys. The girl threw stones and rocks in fury at her laughing tormentors, but when one of the boys threw one back, the joke went horribly awry. She was knocked unconscious, and shocked at what they had done, the boys carried her back to her bed in the inn, but she died during the night. The caves and inn are reputed to be haunted by her ghost, and many staff and visitors have reported sighting a girl in a wedding dress wandering the passageways. West Wycombe Caves on TV In 2004 and 2007 West Wycombe Caves were visited by British and American paranormal reality TV shows Haunted and Hunters.ReferencesExternal links* The Hellfire Caves* Aquiziam: The Hellfire Club and Caves* Subterranea of Great Britain: West Wycombe Caves* The Hellfire Club Caves at West Wycombe* The Hell-Fire Club by Daniel P Mannix

History_of_the_Jews_in_the_United_States
The history of the Jews in the States (United States of America), has been part of the American national fabric since colonial times.Until the 1830s the Jewish community of Charleston, South Carolina was the most numerous in North America.  With the large scale immigration of Jews from Germany in the 19th century, they established themselves in  many small towns and cities.  A much larger immigration of Eastern European Jews, 18801914, brought a large, poor, traditional element to York City.  Refugees arrived from Europe after War II, and many arrived from the Soviet Union after 1970.In the 1940s Jews comprised 3.7% of the national population. Today the population is about 5 millionunder 2% of the national totaland shrinking because of small family sizes and intermarriage.  The largest population centers are the metropolitan areas of New York (2.1 million in 2000), Los Angeles (668,000), Miami (331,000), Philadelphia (285,000), Chicago (265,000) and Boston (254,000).(Sarna (2004) 356-60) Jewish immigration The Jewish population of the US is the product of waves of immigration primarily from Europe; it was initially inspired by the pull of social and entrepreneurial opportunities, and later as a refuge from the push of continuing antisemitism there.  Few ever returned to Europe, although committed advocates of Zionism have emigrated to Israel.(Hasia Diner, The Jews of the United States (2004))America and its culture developed as an easy-to-enter Melting Pot for many cultures, creating a new commonality of culture and political values.  This open culture allowed many minority groups, including Jews, to flourish in Christian and predominantly Protestant America. in the United States has always been less common than in other historic areas of Jewish population, whether in Christian Europe or in the Muslim Middle East, where most nations developed around different majority ethnicities or languages.From a population of 1000-2000 Jewish residents in 1790, mostly Dutch Jews, Jews from England, and British subjects, the American Jewish community grew to about 15,000 by 1840,(Paul Johnson, A History of the Jews, p.366) and to about 250,000 by 1880. Most of the  mid-19th century Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants to the US came from German-speaking states, as part of the larger concurrent German migration.  They all initially spoke German, and settled across the nation, assimilating with their new countrymen; the Jews among them commonly engaged in trade, manufacturing, and operated dry goods (clothing) stores in many cities.Between  1880 and the start of War I in 1914, about two million Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews immigrated from Eastern Europe, where repeated pogroms made life unpredictable. They came from Jewish populations of Russia, the of Settlement (modern Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova), and the Russian-controlled portions of Poland. The latter group clustered in New York City, created the garment industry there, which supplied the dry goods stores across the country, and were heavily engaged in the trade unions.  This wave was also part of a larger migration of eastern and southern European immigrants, which was unlike the historically predominant American demographic from northern and western Europe; Records indicate between 1880 and 1920 that these new immigrants rose from less than five percent of all European immigrants to nearly 50%.  This feared change caused renewed nativist sentiment, the birth of the Restriction League, and  congressional studies by the Commission from 1907 to 1911. The Quota Act of 1921 established immigration restrictions specifically on these groups, and the Act of 1924 further tightened and codified these limits. With the ensuing Depression, and despite worsening conditions for European Jews, with the rise of Germany, these  quotas remained in place with minor alterations until the and Nationality Act of 1965.Jews quickly created support networks consisting of many small synagogues and Ashkenazi Jewish Landsmannschaften (German for Territorial Associations) for Jews from the same town or village.Leaders of the time urged assimilation and integration into the wider American culture, and Jews quickly became part of American life. During War II, 500,000 American Jews, about half of all Jewish males between 18 and 50, enlisted for service, and after the war, Jewish families joined the new trend of suburbanization, as they became wealthier and more mobile. The Jewish community expanded to other major cities, particularly around Angeles and Miami. Their young people attended secular high schools and colleges and met Christians, so that intermarriage rates soared to nearly 50%.  Synagogue membership however, grew considerably, from 20% of the Jewish population in 1930 to 60% in 1960.The earlier waves of immigration and immigration restriction were followed by Holocaust that destroyed most of the European Jewish community by 1945; these also made the United States the home for the largest Jewish population in the world.  In 1900 there were 1.5 million Americans Jews; in 2005 there were 4.9 million.  See Jewish population comparisonsOn a theological level, Jews are divided into a number of Jewish denominations, of which the most numerous are Judaism, Judaism and Judaism.  Conservative Judaism arose in America and Reform Judaism was popularized by American Jews.Colonial eraImage:Touro Synagogue, Newport, RI.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Synagogue, built in 1759 in Rhode Island, is Americas oldest surviving synagogueImage:Gomez Mill House.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The Mill House, built in 1714 near Marlboro, NY by a Sephardic Jew from Portugal. Earliest surviving Jewish residence in the U.S.The first Jew to set foot on American soil was Solomon Franco, a merchant who arrived in Boston in 1649; subsequently he was given a stipend from the Puritans there, on condition he leave on the next passage back to Holland.(See)  In September of 1654, shortly before the Jewish New Year, twenty-three Jews of Dutch ancestry from Recife, Brazil, arrived in New Amsterdam (New York City). Governor Stuyvesant, tried to enhance his Reformed Church by discriminating against other religions, but religious pluralism was already a tradition in the Netherlands and his superiors at the West India Company in Amsterdam overruled him.Religious tolerance was also established elsewhere in the colonies; the colony of South Carolina, for example, was originally governed under an elaborate charter drawn up in 1669 by the English philosopher Locke. This charter granted liberty of conscience to all settlers, expressly mentioning Jews, heathens, and dissenters.(Charleston, S.C.)  As a result, South Carolina has a particularly long history of Sephardic settlement,(http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/0103137.html http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2002/mar/southernjews/index.html and http://www.lib.unc.edu/apop/ and http://www.sc.edu/uscpress/2002/3445.html) which in 1816 numbered over 600, then the largest Jewish population of any city in the United States.(Charleston, S.C.)  Sephardic Dutch Jews were also among the early settlers of Newport (where the countrys oldest surviving synagogue building stands), Savannah, Philadelphia and Baltimore.(See 1, 2, etc.)  In New York City, Shearith Israel Congregation is the oldest continuous congregation started in 1687 having their first synagogue erected in 1728, and its current building still houses some of the original pieces of that first.()  By the time of American Revolution, the Jewish population in America was very small, with only 1,000-2000, in a colonial population of about 2.5 million.Revolutionary eraBy 1776 and the War of Independence, around 2,000 Jews lived in America, most of them Jews of Spanish and Portuguese origin. They played a significant role in the struggle for independence, including fighting the British, with Salvador being the first Jew to die,(A portion of the People, Nell Porter Brown, Magazine, JanuaryFebruary, 2003) and playing a key role in financing the revolution, with the most important of the financiers being Solomon.(David Salisbury Franks) Others, like David Salisbury Franksan, despite loyal service in both the Continental Army and the American diplomatic corps, suffered from his association as aide-de-camp for the traitorous general Arnold.President Washington remembered the Jewish contribution when he wrote to the Sephardic congregation of Rhode Island, in a letter dated August 17, 1790:May the children of the stock of Abraham who dwell in the land continue to merit and enjoy the goodwill of the other inhabitants. While everyone shall sit safely under his own vine and fig-tree and there shall be none to make him afraid.In 1790, the approximate 2,500 Jews in America faced a number of legal restrictions in various states that prevented non-Christians from holding public office and voting, but Delaware, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Georgia soon eliminated these barriers, as did the Bill of Rights in 1791 generally. Sephardic Jews became active in community affairs in the 1790s, after achieving political equality in the five states in which they were most numerous.(Alexander DeConde, Ethnicity, Race, and American Foreign Policy: A History, p.52) Other barriers did not officially fall for decades in the states of Rhode Island (1842), North Carolina (1868), and New Hampshire (1877). Despite these restrictions, which were often enforced unevenly, there were really too few Jews in 17th- and 18th-century America for anti-Jewish incidents to become a significant social or political phenomenon at the time. The evolution  for Jews from toleration to full civil and political equality that followed the American Revolution helped ensure that Antisemitism would never become as common as in Europe.(Jonathan Sarna, American Judaism (2004) ch. 2 and p. 374)19th centuryFollowing traditional religious and cultural teachings about improving the lot of their brethren, Jewish residents in the United States began to organize their communities in the early 19th century. Early examples include a Jewish orphanage set up in Charleston, South Carolina in 1801, and the first Jewish school, Polonies Talmud Torah, established in New York in 1806. In 1843, the first national secular Jewish organization in the United States, the Brith was established. See also of Jewish education in the United States (pre-20th century).Jewish Texans have been a part of Texas History since the first European explorers arrived in the 16th century.() Texas did not welcome easily identifiable Jews, but they came in any case. de la Porta was with Jean Laffite at Texas in 1816, and Henry was in Velasco in the late 1820s. Jews fought in the armies of the Revolution of 1836, some with Fannin at Goliad, others at San Jacinto. Dr. Albert Levy became a surgeon to revolutionary Texan forces in 1835, participated in the capture of Bxar, and joined the Texas Navy the next year.(By 1840, Jews constituted a tiny, but nonetheless stable, middle-class minority of about 15,000 out of the 17 million Americans counted by the U.S. Census. Jews intermarried rather freely with non-Jews, continuing a trend that had begun at least a century earlier. However, as immigration increased the Jewish population to 50,000 by 1848, negative stereotypes of Jews in newspapers, literature, drama, art, and popular culture grew more commonplace and physical attacks became more frequent.During the 19th century, (especially the 1840s and 1850s), Jewish immigration was primarily of Ashkenazi Jews from Germany, bringing a liberal, educated population that had experience with the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment. It was in the United States during the 19th century that two of the major branches of Judaism were established by these German immigrants: Judaism (out of German Reform Judaism) and Judaism, in reaction to the perceived liberalness of Reform Judaism.Civil WarImage:JewishConfederate.JPG|thumb|right|Grave of Jewish Confederate soldier near LouisianaDuring the Civil War, approximately 3,000 Jews (out of around 150,000 Jews in the United States) fought on the Confederate side and 7,000 fought on the Union side.(Jewish Americans Dir. David Grubin. PBS Home Video, 2008. Disc 1, Episode 1, Chapter 5, 0:30:40) Jews also played leadership roles on both sides, with nine Jewish generals and 21 Jewish colonels participating in the War. P. Benjamin, a non-observant Jew, served as Secretary of State and acting Secretary of War of the Confederacy.Several Jewish bankers played key roles in providing government financing for both side of the Civil war:  Speyer and Seligman family,  for the Union, and Erlanger and Company for the confederacy.(Baron, p 224)By the time of the Civil War, tensions over race and immigration, as well as economic competition between Jews and non-Jews, combined to produce the worst outbreak of antisemitism to that date. Americans on both sides of the slavery issue denounced Jews as disloyal war profiteers, and accused them of driving Christians out of business and of aiding and abetting the enemy.Major General S. Grant was influenced by these sentiments and issued General Order No. 11 expelling Jews from areas under his control in western Tennessee:The Jews, as a class violating every regulation of trade established by the Treasury Department and also department orders, are hereby expelled within twenty-four hours from the receipt of this order.This order was quickly rescinded by President Lincoln but not until it had been enforced in a number of towns.()Grant later issued an order that no Jews are to be permitted to travel on the road southward.   His aide, Colonel V. DuBois, ordered all cotton speculators, Jews, and all vagabonds with no honest means of support, to leave the district. The Israelites especially should be kept outthey are such an intolerable nuisance.Participation in politicsJews also began to organize as a political group in the United States, especially in response to the United States reaction to the 1840 Damascus Blood Libel.  The first Jewish member of the States House of Representatives, Charles Levin, and Senator, Levy Yulee, were elected in 1845 (although Yulee converted to Episcopalianism the following year). Official government antisemitism continued, however, with Hampshire only offering equality to Jews in 1877, the last state to do so.::For more information, see  of American Jews to the U.S. Federal Government (pre-20th century).BankingIn the middle of the nineteenth century, a number of German Jews founded investment banking firms which later became mainstays of the industry.  Most prominent Jewish banks in the United States were banks, rather than banks.(Krefetz p 54-55)  Important banking firms  included Sachs (founded by Sachs and Goldman), Loeb (Loeb and H. Schiff), Brothers (Lehman), Brothers, and & Co. (founded by Bache).(Krefetz, p 46)   The Seligman family moved from merchandising to banking in the late 1860s, with operations in New York, St. Louis, and Philadelphia as well as Frankfurt, Germany, London and Paris that gave European investors an opportunity to buy American government and railroad bonds.  By the 1880s the firm financed the French efforts to build a Panama Canal as well as the American effort after 1900. By the 1890s J.& W. Seligman & Co. Inc. underwrote the securities of newly formed trusts, participated in stock and bond issues in the railroad and steel and wire industries, and invested in Russia and Peru, and in American in shipbuilding, bridges, bicycles, mining, and other enterprises. In 1910 C. Durant  of the fledgling Motors Corporation gave control of his company to the Seligmans and Lee, Higginson & Co. in return for underwriting $15 million worth of corporate notes.(Birmingham, Our crowd pp. 231-8, 350)(Perry, p 148)(Jay P. Pederson, ed. International directory of company histories: Volume 61 (2004)  p 141)After the death of Jacob Schiff in 1921, many banks which had their roots in the German-Jewish immigrant community began to lose their Jewish character.  They no longer filled the ranks of management nor sought their capital needs from within the family or the crowd.  By the 1930s, Jewish presence in the private investment banking had diminished dramatically.()West Coast settlementsThe German Jews settled in small towns throughout the South and West, and became most prominent in the far west.  Following the California Gold Rush of 1849, German Jews established themselves on the West Coast, with important settlements in Portland, Oregon, Seattle, Washington, and especially San Francisco, which became the second-largest Jewish city in the nation.   Eisenberg, Kahn, and Toll (2009) emphasize the creative freedom Jews found in western society, unburdening them from past traditions and opening up new opportunities for entrepreneurship, philanthropy and civic leadership.  The most popular occupation was clothing merchant, followed by the small-scale manufacturing and general retailing.  Everyone was a newcomer, and the Jews were generally accepted with few signs of discrimination, according to Eisenberg, Kahn, and Toll (2009). Many Jewish activists became prominent in municipal and state politics, winning election to public office with little attention paid to their Jewish identity. They set up Reform congregations, and generally gave a little support to Zionism down to the 1940s.(Ellen Eisenberg, Ava F. Kahn, and William Toll, Jews of the Pacific Coast: Reinventing Community on Americas Edge (University of Washington Press, 2009) ISBN 978-0-295-98965-5)   In the 20th century, Metropolitan Los Angeles became the second-largest Jewish base in the United States.  The most dramatic cast of newcomers there were in Hollywood, where Jewish producers were highly visible if not dominant in the film industry after 1920.(Neal Gabler, An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood (1989))1880-1925Image:Happynewyearcard.jpg|thumb|225px|In this Hashanah greeting card from the early 1900s, Russian Jews, packs in hand, gaze at the American relatives beckoning them to the United States. Over two million Jews would flee the pogroms of the Empire to the safety of the US from 1881 to 1924.|leftImmigration of Eastern European JewsNone of the early migratory movements assumed the significance and volume of that from Russia and neighboring countries. This emigration, mainly from Russian Poland and other areas of the Empire, began as far back as 1821, but did not become especially noteworthy until after the German immigration fell off in 1870. Though nearly 50,000 Russian, Polish, Galician, and Romanian Jews went to the United States during the succeeding decade, it was not until the pogroms, anti-Jewish uprisings in Russia, of the early 1880s, that the immigration assumed extraordinary proportions. From Russia alone the emigration rose from an annual average of 4,100 in the decade 1871-80 to an annual average of 20,700 in the decade 1881-90. Anti-semitism and official measures of persecution over the past century combined with the desire for economic freedom and opportunity have motivated a continuing flow of Jewish immigrants from Russia and Eastern Europe over the past century.The Romanian persecutions, beginning in 1900, forced large numbers of Jews to seek refuge in the US. Though most of these immigrants arrived on the Eastern seaboard, many came as part of the Movement, through which Jewish immigrants settled in Texas as well as the western states and territories.(Hardwick (2002), pg. 13)By 1924, two million Jews had arrived from Eastern Europe.  Growing anti-immigration feelings in the United States at this time, resulted in the National Origins Quota of 1924 which severely restricted immigration from many regions including Eastern Europe. The Jewish community took the lead in opposing immigration restrictions, which remained in effect until 1965.Local developmentsClarksburg, West VirginiaIn 1900, five of seven clothing merchants in Clarksburg, West Virginia, were Jewish, and into the 1930s the Jews here were primarily merchants. Because of the need to expand their synagogue, the Orthodox Jewish congregation merged with a smaller Reform group to form a compromise Conservative congregation in 1939, and Jewish community life in Clarksburg centered around this synagogue. The community, which reached a population peak of about three hundred in the mid-1950s, is still represented by about thirty families.(Deborah R. Weiner, The Jews of Clarksburg: Community Adaptation and Survival, 1900-60. West Virginia History 1995 54: 59-77. 0043-325x)Wichita, KansasThe Jews of Wichita, Kansas, fashioned an ethnoreligious world that was distinct, vibrant, and tailored to their circumstances. They had migrated west with capital, credit, and know-how, and their family-based businesses were extensions of family businesses in the east. They distinguished themselves in educational, leadership, and civic positions. Predominantly German Jews through the 1880s, their remoteness and small numbers encouraged the practice of Reform Judaism, which in turn increased their interaction with non-Jews and hastened the erosion of their heritage. The arrival of conservative Jews from Eastern Europe after the 1880s brought tension into the Wichita Jewish community, but also stirred an ethnoreligious revival. The German Jews were well respected in the Wichita community, which facilitated the integration of the Eastern European newcomers. The Jewish community was characterized by a dynamic tension between tradition and modernization.(Hal Rothman, Same Horse, New Wagon: Tradition and Assimilation among the Jews of Wichita, 1865-1930. Great Plains Quarterly 1995 15(2): 83-104. 0275-7664)Oakland, CaliforniaThe Jewish community in Oakland, California, is representative of many cities. Jews played a prominent role, and were among the pioneers of Oakland in the 1850s. In the early years, the Oakland Hebrew Benevolent Society, founded in 1862, was the religious, social, and charitable center of the community. Later, the first synagogue, founded in 1875, took over the religious and burial functions. Jews from Poland predominated in the community, and most of them worked in some aspect of the clothing industry. David Solis-Cohen, the noted author, was a leader in the Oakland Jewish community in the 1870s. In 1879 Oaklands growing Jewish community organized a second congregation, a strictly orthodox group, Poel Zedek. Womens religious organizations flourished, their charitable services extending to needy gentiles as well as Jews. Oakland Jewry was part of the greater San Francisco community, yet maintained its own character. In 1881 the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland, elected Myer Solomon Levy as its rabbi. The London-born Levy practiced traditional Judaism. Oaklands Jews were pushed hard to excel in school, both secular and religious. Fannie Bernstein was the first Jew to graduate from the University of California at Berkeley, in 1883. First Hebrew Congregation sponsored a Sabbath school which had 75 children in 1887.Oakland Jewry was active in public affairs and charitable projects in the 1880s. Rabbi Myer S. Levy was chaplain to the state legislature in 1885. The Daughters of Israel Relief Society continued its good works both inside and outside the Jewish community. Beth Jacob, the traditional congregation of Old World Polish Jews, continued its separate religious practices while it maintained friendly relations with the members of the first Hebrew Congregation.  Able social and political leadership came from David Samuel Hirshberg. Until 1886 he was an officer in the Grand Lodge of Bnai Brith. He served as Under Sheriff of Alameda County in 1883 and was active in Democratic party affairs. In 1885 he was appointed Chief Clerk of the US Mint in San Francisco. As a politician, he had detractors who accused him of using his position in Bnai Brith to foster his political career. When refugees from the fire-stricken, poorer Jewish quarter of San Francisco came to Oakland, the synagogue provided immediate aid. Food and clothing were given to the needy and 350 people were given a place to sleep. For about a week the synagogue fed up to 500 people three times a day. A large part of the expenses were paid by the Jewish Ladies organization of the synagogue.(William M. Kramer, The Emergence of Oakland Jewry. Western States Jewish Historical Quarterly 1978 10 (2): 99-125, (3): 238-259, (4): 353-373; 11(1): 69-86; 1979 11(2): 173-186, (3): 265-278. 0043-4221)Progressive movementImage:Abolish child slavery.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Half-length portrait of two girls wearing banners with slogan ABOLISH CHILD SLAVERY!! in English and Yiddish. Probably taken during May 1, 1909 labor parade in York City.With the influx of Jews from Central and Eastern Europe many members of the Jewish community were attracted to labor and socialist movements and numerous Jewish newspapers such as Forwerts and Freiheit had a socialist orientation. Left wing organizations such as the Arbeter Ring and the Jewish Peoples Fraternal Order played an important part in Jewish community life until World War II.Jewish Americans were not just involved in nearly every important social movement but in the forefront of promoting such issues as workers rights, civil rights, womans rights, freedom of religion, peace movements, and various other progressive causes.AmericanizationSchiff played a major role as a leader of the American Jewish community in the late 19th century. As a wealthy German Jew, Schiff made important decisions regarding the arrival of Eastern European Jewish immigrants. At a time of increasing demand for immigration restriction, Schiff supported and worked for Jewish Americanization. A Reform Jew, he backed the creation of the Conservative Jewish Theological Seminary of America. He took a stand favoring a modified form of Zionism, reversing his earlier opposition. Above all, Schiff believed that American Jewry could live in both the Jewish and American worlds, creating a balance that made possible an enduring American Jewish community.(Evyatar Friesel, Jacob H. Schiff and the Leadership of the American Jewish Community. Jewish Social Studies 2002 8(2-3): 61-72. 0021-6704)The National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW), founded in Chicago in 1893, had the goals of philanthropy and the Americanization of Jewish immigrants. Responding to the plight of Jewish women and girls from Eastern Europe, the NCJW created its Department of Immigrant Aid to assist and protect female immigrants from the time of their arrival at Ellis Island until their settlement at their final destination. The NCJWs Americanization program included assisting immigrants with housing, health, and employment problems, leading them to organizations where women could begin to socialize, and conducting English classes while helping them maintain a strong Jewish identity. The council, pluralistic rather than conformist, continued its Americanization efforts and fought against restrictive immigration laws after World War I. At the forefront of its activities was the religious education of Jewish girls, who were ignored by the Orthodox community.(Seth Korelitz, A Magnificent Piece of Work: the Americanization Work of the National Council of Jewish Women. American Jewish History 1995 83(2): 177-203.)PhilanthropySince the 1820s organized philanthropy has been a core value of the American Jewish community. In most cities the philanthropic organizations are the center of the Jewish community and activism is highly valued. Much of the money now goes to Israel, as well as hospitals and higher education; previously it went to poor Jews. This meant in the 1880-1930 era wealth German Reform Jews were subsidizing poor Orthodox newcomers, and helping their process of  Americanization, thus helping bridge the cultural gap. This convergence brought Jews into the political debates in the 1900-1930 period over immigration restriction. Jews were the leading opponents of restrictions, but could not stop their passage in 1924 or their use to keep out most refugees from Hitler in the 1930s.(Diner, The Jews of the United States 135-40, 173-82)Rosenwald (18621932) moved to Chicago in the late 1880s. Purchasing a half-interest in 1895, he transformed a small mail order house Sears, Roebuck into the largest retailer in America. He used his wealth for philanthropy targeted especially at the plight of rural blacks in collaboration with T. Washington. From 1917 to 1932 the Julius Rosenwald Foundation set up 5,357 public schools for blacks. He funded numerous hospitals for blacks in the South as well as 24 YMCAs; he was a major contributor to the NAACP and the Urban League. His major contributions to the of Chicago and to various Jewish philanthropies were on a similar grand scale. He spent $11 million to fund the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry.(The Foundation gave away all its money and closed down in 1948. Lawrence P. Bachmann, Julius Rosenwald, American Jewish Historical Quarterly 1976 66(1): 89-105; Peter M. Ascoli, Julius Rosenwald (2006))Rise to affluence in the 20th centuryDuring the twentieth century, Jews in America joined the middle class, and towards the end of the century, became relatively wealthy.   In 1983, economist Sowell of Stanford University wrote  Jewish family incomes are the highest of any large ethnic group in the US - 72% above the national average.(*Sowell, Thomas, Ethnic America: a History, Basic Books, 1983, p 98.*See also Krefetz p 8)  Sowell points out that Episcopalians have also experienced similar prosperity - as a group  - as Jews, but it is the social and economic distance covered in a relatively short time that makes the Jewish experience in America unique.(Sowell, p 99)Gerald Krefetz discusses the prosperity that Jews earned in the United States following their emigration from Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and he attributes their success to their familiarity with trading and exchanging, commerce, city living, property rights, ... and accumulation of funds for future investment ... (Krefetz, p 41-44)Historian Edward Shapiro cites a magazine survey from the 1980s, which showed that, of the 400 richest Americans, over 100 were Jewish, which was nine times greater than would be expected based on the overall population.(Shapiro,  pp 117-118)  Shapiro also estimates that  over 30% of American billionaires are Jewish, and he cites a 1986 issue of World that listed the top 100 money makers in 1985, and half the people mentioned were Jewish, including Soros, Edelman, Milkin, and Boesky.(Shapiro,  pp 117-118)Gerald Krefetz writes whether it is called intestinal fortitude, operation bootstrap, moxie, social striving ,or upward mobility, American Jews have fought mightily for financial security... As a group Jews have attained a higher standard of living and earn more money than any other religious group in the United States... Jews are the richest of the rich(Krefetz, p 9)Lynching of Leo FrankIn 1913, a Jew in Atlanta named Frank was convicted for the rape and murder of Mary Phagan, a 13-year-old Christian girl in his employ.  Frank was sentenced to death but Governor Slaton, convinced by a review of the evidence that Frank was innocent, commuted the sentence to life imprisonment.  As a result of public outrage over this act, a Georgia mob kidnapped Frank from prison and lynched him.In response to the lynching of Frank, Livingston founded the League (ADL) under the sponsorship of Brith.  The ADL became the leading Jewish group fighting anti-Semitism in the United States.  The lynching of Frank coincided with and helped spark the revival of the Klux Klan. The Klan disseminated the view that anarchists, communists and Jews were subverting American values and ideals.World War IThe number of Jews who served in the American military during World War I was disproportionate to their representation in the American population at large.  The 250,000 Jews who served represented approximately 5% of the American armed forces whereas Jews only constituted 3% of the general population.()As early as 1914, the American Jewish community mobilized its resources to assist the victims of the European war.  Cooperating to a degree not previously seen, the various factions of the American Jewish communitynative-born and immigrant, Reform, Orthodox, secular, and socialistcoalesced to form what eventually became known as the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. All told, American Jews raised 63 million dollars in relief funds during the war years and became more immersed in European Jewish affairs than ever before.1930sDavid Gerber describes the middle and late 1930s as a period characterized by a quasi-fascist and anti-communist anti-Semitism which blamed Jews for the Great Depression and the international crises in Europe.()Refugees from Nazi GermanyIn the years before and during World War II the United States Congress, the Roosevelt Administration, and public opinion expressed concern about the fate of Jews in Europe but consistently refused to permit large-scale immigration of Jewish refugees.In a report issued by the State Department, Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat noted that the United States accepted only 21,000 refugees from Europe and did not significantly raise or even fill its restrictive quotas, accepting far fewer Jews per capita than many of the neutral European countries and fewer in absolute terms than Switzerland.According to David Wyman, The United States and its Allies were willing to attempt almost nothing to save the Jews.(David S. Wyman, The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust, 1941-1945 (New York, 1984), p. 5.)U.S. opposition to immigration in general in the late 1930s was motivated by the grave economic pressures, the high unemployment rate, and social frustration and disillusionment. The U.S. refusal to support specifically Jewish immigration, however, stemmed from something else, namely antisemitism, which had increased in the late 1930s and continued to rise in the 1940s. It was an important ingredient in Americas negative response to Jewish refugees.()About 100,000 German Jews did arrive in the 1930s, escaping Hitlers persecution.MS St. LouisThe SS St. Louis sailed from Germany in May 1939 carrying 936 (mainly German) Jewish refugees. On 4 June 1939, it was also refused permission to unload on orders of President Roosevelt as the ship waited in the Sea between Florida and Cuba. Initially, Roosevelt showed limited willingness to take in some of those on board. But the Act of 1924 made that illegal and public opinion was strongly opposed . The ship returned to Europe. 620 of the passengers were eventually accepted in continental Europe, of these only 365 survived the Holocaust.World War II and the HolocaustFile:Synagogue D-Day3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A synagogue on West Twenty-Third Street in York City remained open 24 hours on D-Day for special services and prayer.The United States tight immigration policies were not lifted during the Holocaust, news of which began to reach the United States in 1941 and 1942 and it has been estimated that 190,000200,000 Jews could have been saved during the Second World War had it not been for bureaucratic obstacles to immigration deliberately created by Long and others.()Rescue of the European Jewish population was not a priority for the US during the war, and the American Jewish community did not realize the severity of the Holocaust until late in the conflict.The HolocaustDuring the World War II period the American Jewish community was bitterly and deeply divided, and was unable to form a common front. Most Eastern Europeans favored Zionism, which saw a homeland as the only solution; this had the effect of diverting attention from the horrors in Nazi Germany. German Jews were alarmed at the Nazis but were disdainful of Zionism. Proponents of a Jewish state and Jewish army agitated, but many leaders were so fearful of an antisemitic backlash inside the U.S. that they demanded that all Jews keep a low public profile. One important development was the sudden conversion of most (but not all) Jewish leaders to Zionism late in the war.(Henry L. Feingold, A Time for Searching: Entering the Mainstream, 19201945 (1992), pp 22565)The Holocaust was largely ignored by America media as it was happening.(Deborah Lipstadt, Beyond Belief: The American Press and the Coming of the Holocaust (1993),) Why that was is illuminated by the anti-Zionist position taken by Hays Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times, during World War II.(Laurel Leff, Buried by The Times: The Holocaust and Americas Most Important Newspaper (Cambridge University Press, 2005)) Committed to classical Reform Judaism, which defined Judaism as a religious faith and not as a people, Sulzberger insisted that as an American he saw European Jews as part of a refugee problem, not separate from it. As publisher of the nations most influential newspaper, The New York Times, he permitted only a handful of editorials during the war on the extermination of the Jews. He supported the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism. Even after it became known that the Nazis had singled out the Jews for destruction, Sulzberger held that all refugees had suffered. He opposed the creation of Israel. In effect, he muted the enormous potential influence of the Times by keeping issues of concern regarding Jews off the editorial page and burying stories about Nazi atrocities against Jews in short items deep inside the paper. In time he grew increasingly out of step with the American Jewish community by his persistent refusal to recognize Jews as a people and despite obvious flaws in his view of American democracy.(Laurel Leff, A Tragic Fight In The Family: The New York Times, Reform Judaism and the Holocaust. American Jewish History 2000 88(1): 3-51. 0164-0178)While Jews owned few prestigious newspapers other than the New York Times, they had a major presence in Hollywood and in network radio. Hollywood films and radio with few exceptions avoided questioning Nazi persecution of Europes Jews prior to Pearl Harbor. Jewish studio executives did not want to be accused of advocating Jewish propaganda by making films with overtly antifascist themes. Indeed, they were pressured by such organizations as the League and by national Jewish leaders to avoid such themes lest American Jews suffer an antisemitic backlash.(Felicia Herman, Hollywood, Nazism, and the Jews, 193341. American Jewish History 2001 89(1): 6189; Joyce Fine, American Radio Coverage of the Holocaust, Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual 1988 5: 145165. 0741-8450.)RescueDespite strong public and political sentiment to the contrary, however, there were some who encouraged the US government to help victims of Nazi genocide. In 1943, just before Kippur, 400 rabbis marched in Washington to draw attention to the plight of Holocaust victims (see The Day the Rabbis Marched.) A week later, Senator Warren Barbour (R; New Jersey), one of a handful of politicians who met with the rabbis on the steps of the US Capitol, proposed legislation that would have allowed as many as 100,000 victims of the Holocaust to emigrate temporarily to the United States. Barbour died six weeks after introducing the bill, and it was not passed. A parallel bill was introduced in the  House of Representatives by Rep.  Samuel Dickstein (D; New York). This also failed to pass.(Davis S. Wyman Institute; The New York Times)During Holocaust, fewer than 30,000 Jews a year reached the United States, and some were turned away due to immigration policies. The US did not change its immigration policies until 1948.ImpactThe Holocaust had a profound impact on the community in the United States, especially after 1960, as Jews tried to comprehend what had happened, and especially to commemorate and grapple with it when looking to the future.(Peter Novick, The Holocaust in American Life (2000)) Joshua Heschel summarized this dilemma when he attempted to understand Auschwitz: To try to answer is to commit a supreme blasphemy. Israel enables us to bear the agony of Auschwitz without radical despair, to sense a ray of Gods radiance in the jungles of history.(Staub (2004) p.80)Postwar500,000 American Jews (or half of the eligible men) fought in War II, and after the war younger families joined the new trend of suburbanization. There, Jews became increasingly assimilated and demonstrated rising intermarriage. The suburbs facilitated the formation of new centers, as Jewish school enrollment more than doubled between the end of World War II and the mid-1950s, and synagogue affiliation jumped from 20% in 1930 to 60% in 1960; the fastest growth came in Reform and, especially, Conservative congregations.(Sarna, American Judaism (2004) p 284-5)Having never been subjected to the Holocaust, the United States stood after the Second World War as the largest, richest, and healthiest center of Judaism in the world. Smaller Jewish communities turned increasingly to American Jewry for guidance and support.()Immediately after the Second World War, some Jewish refugees resettled in the United States, and another wave of Jewish refugees from Arab nations settled in the US after expulsion from their home countries.Liberal politicsWhile earlier Jewish elements from Germany were business oriented and voted as conservative Republicans, the wave of Eastern European Jews starting in the 1880s, were more liberal or left wing and became the political majority.(Diner, The Jews of the United States. 1654 to 2000 (2004), ch 5) Many came to America with experience in the socialist and anarchist movements as well as the Labor Bund, based in Eastern Europe. Many Jews rose to leadership positions in the early 20th century American labor movement and helped to found unions in the needle trades (clothing industry) that played a major role in the CIO and in Democratic Party politics. Hillman of the CIO was especially powerful in the early 1940s at the national level.((Steve Fraser, Labor Will Rule: Sidney Hillman and the Rise of American Labor (1993))By the 1930s Jews were a major political factor in New York City, with strong support for the most liberal programs of the Deal. Since most East European Jews were excluded from the Irish-controlled Democratic Party in New York City they worked through third parties, the Labor Party and the Party of New York.(Ronald H. Bayor, Neighbors in Conflict: The Irish, Germans, Jews and Italians of New York City, 1929-1941, (1978)) By the 1940s they were inside the Democratic Party, and helped overthrow Tammany Hall. They continued as a major element of the Deal coalition, giving special support to the Civil Rights Movement. By the mid 1960s, however, the Black Power movement caused a growing separation between blacks and Jews, though both groups remained solidly in the Democratic camp.(See Murray Friedman, What Went Wrong? The Creation and Collapse of the Black-Jewish Alliance. (1995))(Joshua M. Zeitz, White Ethnic New York: Jews, Catholics, and the Shaping of Postwar Politics (2007).)Although German Jews generally leaned Republican in the second half of the 19th century, the East European elements voted Democratic or for left parties since at least 1916, when they voted 55% for Wilson.() American Jews voted 90% against the Republicans and supported Democrats D. Roosevelt and S. Truman in the elections of 1940, 1944 and 1948,( despite both party platforms supporting the creation of a Jewish state in the latter two elections.(Abba Hillel Silver) During the 1952 and 1956 elections, they voted 60% or more for Democrat Adlai Stevenson, while General Eisenhower garnered 40% for his reelection; the best showing to date for the Republicans since Hardings 43% in 1920.( In 1960, 83% voted for Democrat F. Kennedy, a Catholic, against Nixon, and in 1964, 90% of American Jews voted for Lyndon Johnson; his Republican opponent, arch-conservative Goldwater, was Protestant but his paternal grandparents were Jewish.(Mark R. Levy and Michael S. Kramer, The Ethnic Factor (1973) p. 103) Humphrey garnered 81% of the Jewish vote in the 1968 elections, in his losing bid for president against Nixon, a high level of Jewish support not seen since.((Sandy Maisel and Ira Forman, eds. Jews in American Politics (2001))During the Nixon re-election campaign of 1972, Jewish voters were apprehensive about McGovern and only favored the Democrat by 65%, while Nixon more than doubled Republican Jewish support to 35%. In the election of 1976, Jewish voters supported Democrat Carter by 71% over incumbent president Fords 27%, but in 1980 they abandoned Carter, leaving him with only 45% support, while Republican winner, Reagan, garnered 39%, and 14% went to independent John Anderson.(During the Reagan re-election campaign of 1984, the Jews returned home to the Democratic Party, giving Reagan only 31% compared to 67% for Democrat Mondale. The same 2-1 pattern reappeared in 1988 as Democrat Dukakis had 64%, while victorious George Bush polled 35%. Bushs Jewish support collapsed during his re-election in 1992, to just 11%, with 80% voting for Clinton and 9% going to independent Perot. Clintons re-election campaign in 1996 maintained high Jewish support at 78%, with 16% supporting Dole and 3% for Perot.(ExceptionalismHistorians believe American Jewish history has been characterized by an unparalleled degree of freedom, acceptance, and prosperity that has made it possible for Jews to bring together their ethnic identities with the demands of national citizenship far more effortlessly than Jews in Europe.(See American Jewish Historical Society 2010 Scholars Conference)  American Jewish exceptionalism differentiates Jews from other American ethnic groups by means of educational and economic attainments and, indeed, by virtue of Jewish values, including a devotion to political liberalism.  As Dollinger (2002) has found, for the last century the most secular Jews have tended toward the most liberal or even leftist political views, while more religious Jews are politically more conservative. Modern Orthodox Jews have been less active in political movements than Reform Jews. They vote Republican more often than less traditional Jews. In contemporary political debate, strong Orthodox support for various school voucher initiatives undermines the exceptionalist belief that the Jewish community seeks a high and impenetrable barrier between church and state.(Marc Dollinger, American Jewish Liberalism Revisited: Two Perspectives Exceptionalism and Jewish Liberalism. American Jewish History v 30#2 2002. pp 161+. online at Questia)Creation of the State of IsraelWith its establishment in 1948, the State of Israel became the focal point of American Jewish life and philanthropy, as well as the symbol around which American Jews united.(Six-Day WarThe Six-Day War of June 1967 marked a turning point in the lives of many 1960s-era Jews. The paralyzing fear of a second Holocaust followed by tiny Israels seemingly miraculous victory over the combined Arab armies arrayed to destroy it struck deep emotional chords among American Jews. Their financial support for Israel rose sharply in the wars wake, and more of them than ever before chose in those years to make Israel their permanent home.(A lively internal debate commenced, following the War. The American Jewish community was divided over whether they agreed with the Israeli response; the great majority came to accept the war as necessary. A tension existed especially for leftist Jews, between their liberal ideology and Zionist backing in the midst of this conflict. This deliberation about the Six-Day War showed the depth and complexity of Jewish responses to the varied events of the 1960s.(Staub (2004))Civil rightsJews were highly visible as leaders of movements for civil rights for all Americans, including themselves and African Americans. Seymour Siegel argues the historic struggle against prejudice faced by Jewish people led to a natural sympathy for any people confronting discrimination. This further led Jews to discuss the relationship they had with African Americans. Jewish leaders spoke at the two iconic marches of the era. Joachim Prinz, president of the American Jewish Congress, appeared at the March on Washington on 28 August 1963, noting that As Jews we bring to this great demonstration, in which thousands of us proudly participate, a twofold experience--one of the spirit and one of our history(Staub (2004) p. 90) Two years later Joshua Heschel of the Jewish Theological Seminary marched in the front row of the Selma-to-Montgomery march.Within Judaism, increasing involvement in the civil rights movement caused some tension. Rabbi Bernard Wienberger exemplified this point of view, warning that northern liberal Jews put at risk southern Jews who faced hostility from white southerners because of their northern counterparts. However, most known Jewish responses to the civil rights movement and black relations lean toward acceptance and against prejudice, as the disproportionate involvement of Jews in the movement would indicate.( Despite this history of participation, relations between African Americans and Jews have sometimes been strained by their close proximity and class differences, especially in New York and other urban areas.Jewish feminismIn its modern form, the Jewish feminist movement can be traced to the early 1970s in the States. According to Plaskow, who has focused on feminism in Judaism, the main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or minyan, the exemption from positive time-bound mitzvot, and womens inability to function as witnesses and to initiate divorce.(Plaskow, Judith. Jewish Feminist Thought in Frank, Daniel H. & Leaman, Oliver. History of Jewish Philosophy, Routledge, first published 1997; this edition 2003.)Immigration from the Soviet UnionThe last large wave of immigration came from the Soviet Union after 1988, in response to heavy political pressure from the U.S. government.  After the 1967 Six-Day War and the liberalization tide in Eastern Europe in 1968, Soviet policy became more restrictive. Jews were denied educational and vocational opportunities. These restrictive policies led to the emergence of a new political group - the refuseniks - whose main goal was emigrating. The refuseniks (Jews who were refused exit visas) attracted the attention of the West, particularly the United States, and became an important factor influencing economic and trade relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.  The 1975 Jackson Amendment to the Trade Reform Act linked granting the USSR most favored nation status to liberalization of Soviet emigration laws.(Henry L. Feingold, Silent No More: Saving the Jews of Russia, the American Jewish Effort, 1967-1989 (2007))Beginning in 1967 the Soviet Union allowed some Jewish citizens to leave for family reunification in Israel. Due to the break in diplomatic relations between Israel and the USSR, most migrs traveled to Vienna, Austria, or Budapest, Hungary, from where they were then flown to Israel. After 1976 the majority of migrs who left on visas for Israel dropped out in Vienna and chose to resettle in the West. Several American Jewish organizations helped them obtain visas and aided their resettlement in the United States and other countries. However Israel wanted them and tried to prevent Soviet Jewish migrs from resettling in the United States after having committed to immigrating to Israel. Israeli officials pressured American Jewish organizations to desist from aiding Russian Jews who wanted to resettle in the United States. Initially, American Jews resisted Israeli efforts. Following Gorbachevs decision in the late 1980s to allow free emigration for Soviet Jews, the American Jewish community agreed to a quota on Soviet Jewish refugees in the U.S., which resulted in most Soviet Jewish migrs settling in Israel.(Fred A. Lazin, Freedom of Choice: Israeli Efforts to Prevent Soviet Jewish Emigres to Resettle in the United States, Review of Policy Research 2006 23(2): 387-411 in EBSCO)The Russian Jewish population in the United States is the second only to the population of Russian Jews in Israel. According to RINA, there is a core Russian-Jewish population of 350,000 in the U.S. The enlarged Russian Jewish population in the U.S. is estimated to be 700,000.(http://www.ajcrussian.org/atf/cf/%7B66BD09D8-5251-4553-8C19-5FC7BEAF0E76%7D/russian_jews_in_america.pdf) Some 100,000 Ashkenazi and Bukharian Jews immigrate to the United States.(Annelise Orleck, The Soviet Jewish Americans (1999))   Large pockets of Russian-Jewish Communities include New York, specifically Beach and Bay, and in the Isles Beach neighborhood of Florida.  Another large pocket of Russian Jewish residence is Northeast Philadelphia and surrounding Bucks and Montgomery Counties, as well as Northern New Jersey.Local DevelopmentsNashville TennesseeReform Jews, predominantly German, became Nashvilles largest and most influential Jewish community in the first half of the 20th century; they enjoyed good relations with the Orthodox and Conservative congregations. Some German Jewish refugees resettled in Nashville from 1935 to 1939, helped by prominent Nashville families. Both the Orthodox and Conservative congregations had relocated their synagogues to the suburbs by 1949, and the entire Jewish community had shifted southwest by about five miles. Although subtle social discrimination existed, Nashvilles Jews enjoyed the respect of the larger community. Public acceptance, however, required complicity in racial segregation. The Observer, Nashvilles weekly Jewish newspaper, tried to find a middle ground between assimilation and particularism, but after years of calling for group solidarity, accepted that the Jewish community was pluralistic.(Rob Spinney, The Jewish Community in Nashville, 1939-1949. Tennessee Historical Quarterly 1993 52(4): 225-241. 0040-3261)Palm Springs, CaliforniaAbout 32,000 Jews reside in the Palm Springs area, reports the United Jewish Congress of the Desert. The world-famous desert resort community has been widely known for its Hollywood celebrities. Philadelphia publisher Annenberg opened the Tamarisk Country Club in 1946, after being refused membership in the Los Angeles Lakeside country club. But his connections with Hollywood and corporations alike made his country club a success, and made it a policy to allow Jews and all people, regardless of race and religion, to have access to his facility.Many elderly American Jews from the East coast and the Los Angeles metropolitan area, come to retire in the warm climates such as the Coachella Valley, favoring in golf course and mobile home communities. By the 1990s they were a large component of demography in the desert resort. There are 12 Jewish places of worship, including a Jewish community center in Palm Desert. Palm Springs has the annual Winter Festival of Lights parade, which began as a separate parade to celebrate Chanukah in the 1960s. Over time, that and the Christmas-themed parade merged into the one celebrating the seasons lights of menorahs, Christmas trees and the calendar new year.(Christopher Ogden, Legacy: A Biography of Moses and Walter Annenberg (1999))(Amy Klein, Seniors Opting to Go West, Build New Jewish Life, JewishJournal.com May 20, 2009)MiamiAfter 1945 many northeastern Jews moved to Florida, especially to Miami, Miami Beach, and nearby cities. They found familiar foods and better weather, and founded more open, less tradition-bound communities, where greater materialism and more leisure-oriented, less disciplined Judaism developed. Many relaxed their religiosity and attended services only during Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. In South Florida synagogue affiliation, Jewish community center membership, and per capita contributions to the United Jewish Appeal and the Jewish Federation are among the lowest of any Jewish community in the United States.(Deborah Dash Moore, To the Golden Cities: Pursuing the American Jewish Dream in Miami and L.A. (1994); Stephen J. Whitfield, Blood and Sand: the Jewish Community of South Florida. American Jewish History 1994 82(1-4): 73-96. 0164-0178)PrincetonThe development of Jewish (particularly Orthodox) student life at University improved rapidly since the end of World War II, when Jewish students were few and isolated. In 1958 Jewish students were more numerous; they protested against the Bicker system of eating club member selection. In 1961 Yavneh House was established as Princetons first kosher kitchen. In 1971 Stevenson Hall opened as a university-managed kosher eating facility in the midst of the older private eating clubs. Jewish student initiative and Princeton administration openness deserve credit for this progress.(Marianne Sanua, Stages in the Development of Jewish Life at Princeton University, American Jewish History 1987 76(4): 391-415. 0164-0178)Current situationthumb|500px|Jewish population today tends to be concentrated in larger cities, Florida, and the states of the Northeast.American Jews continued to prosper throughout the early 21st century. American Jews  are disproportionately represented in business, academia and politics. Forty-five percent of the top 40 of the Forbes 400 richest Americans are Jewish. Twenty percent of professors at leading universities are Jewish. Forty percent of partners in the leading law firms in New York and Washington are Jewish.  Thirty percent of American Nobel prize winners in science and 37 percent of all American Nobel winners are Jewish. An estimated thirty percent of Ivy League students are Jewish.(David Brooks, The Tel Aviv Cluster, New York Times January 11, 2010)Demographically, the population is not increasing. With their success, American Jews have become increasingly assimilated into American culture, with high intermarriage rates resulting in either a falling or steady population rate at a time when the country was booming. It has not grown appreciably since 1960, comprises a smaller percentage of Americas total population than it had in 1920, and seems likely to witness an actual decline in numbers in the decades ahead.(Jews also began to move to the suburbs, with major population shifts from New York and the Northeast to Florida and California.  New Jewish organizations were founded to accommodate an increasing range of Jewish worship and community activities, as well as geographic dispersal.Politically, the Jewish population remained strongly liberal. The heavily Democratic pattern continued into the 21st century. Since 1936 the great majority of Jews have been Democrats. In 2004 74% of Jews voted for Democrat Kerry, a Catholic of partial Jewish descent, and in 2006 87% voted for Democratic candidates for the House.(From national exit polls, http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html and http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/states/US/H/00/epolls.0.html)  By the 1990s Jews were becoming prominent in Congress and state governments throughout the country.  Jews proved to be strong supporters of the American Civil Rights Movement.Self identitySocial historians analyze the American population in terms of class, race, ethnicity, religion, gender, region and urbanism. Jewish scholars generally emphasize ethnicity.(For a dissenting opinion, see Jonathan D. Sarna, American Judaism: A History (2004), who sees American Jewish history primarily in religious terms: a story of people who lose their faith and a story of people who regain their faith, (p. xiv))  First, it reflects the suppression of the term Jewish race, a contested but fairly common usage right into the 1930s and its replacement by the more acceptable ethnic usage.  Second, it reflects a post-religious evaluation of American Jewish identity, in which Jewishness (rather than Judaism) is taken to be more inclusive, embracing the secularized as well as the religious experiences of Jews.(Eli Lederhendler, The New Filiopietism, or toward a New History of Jewish Immigration to America, American Jewish History Volume: 93#1 2007. pp 1+. online edition)Korelitz (1996) shows how American Jews during the late 19th and early 20th centuries abandoned a racial definition of Jewishness in favor of one that embraced ethnicity. The key to understanding this transition from a racial self-definition to a cultural or ethnic one can be found in the Menorah Journal between 1915 and 1925. During this time contributors to the Menorah promoted a cultural, rather than a racial, religious, or other view of Jewishness as a means to define Jews in a world that threatened to overwhelm and absorb Jewish uniqueness. The journal represented the ideals of the menorah movement established by Kallen and others to promote a revival in Jewish cultural identity and combat the idea of race as a means to define or identify peoples.(Seth Korelitz, The Menorah Idea: From Religion to Culture, From Race to Ethnicity, American Jewish History 1997 85(1): 75100. 0164-0178)Siporin (1990) uses the family folklore of ethnic Jews to their collective history and its transformation into an historical art form. They tell us how Jews have survived being uprooted and transformed. Many immigrant narratives bear a theme of the arbitrary nature of fate and the reduced state of immigrants in a new culture. By contrast, ethnic family narratives tend to show the ethnic more in charge of his life, and perhaps in danger of losing his Jewishness altogether. Some stories show how a family member successfully negotiated the conflict between ethnic and American identities.(Steve Siporin, Immigrant and Ethnic Family Folklore, Western States Jewish History 1990 22(3): 230242. 0749-5471)After 1960 memories of the Holocaust, together with the War in 1967 that resulted in the survival of Israel had major impacts on fashioning Jewish ethnic identity. The Shoah provided Jews with a rationale for their ethnic distinction at a time when other minorities were asserting their own.(Peter Novick, The Holocaust in American Life (1999); Hilene Flanzbaum, ed. The Americanization of the Holocaust (1999); Monty Noam Penkower, Shaping Holocaust Memory, American Jewish History 2000 88(1): 127132. 0164-0178)Antisemitism in the United StatesAnti-Jewish sentiment started around the time of the Civil War, when General S. Grant issued an order (quickly rescinded by President Lincoln) of expulsion against Jews from the portions of Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi under his control.  (See General Order No. 11)Antisemitism continued into the first half of 20th century. Jews were discriminated against in some employment, not allowed into some social clubs and resort areas, given a quota on enrollment at colleges, and not allowed to buy certain properties.Antisemitism in America reached its peak during the interwar period. The rise of the Klux Klan in the 1920s, the antisemitic works of Ford, and the radio speeches of Father Coughlin in the late 1930s indicated the strength of attacks on the Jewish community.Antisemitism in the United States has rarely turned into physical violence against Jews. Some more notable cases of such violence include the attack of Irish workers and police on the funeral procession of Rabbi Jacob Joseph in York City in 1902, the lynching of Frank in 1915, the murder of Berg in 1984, and the Heights riots of 1991.Following the Second World War and the American Civil Rights Movement, anti-Jewish sentiment waned.  Some members of the Black Nationalist of Islam claimed that Jews were responsible for the exploitation of black labor, bringing alcohol and drugs into their communities, and unfair domination of the economy. Furthermore, according to surveys begun in 1964 by the League, a Jewish organization, Americans are significantly more likely than white Americans to hold antisemitic beliefs, although there is a strong correlation between education level and the rejection of antisemitic stereotypes for all races. However, black Americans of all education levels are nevertheless significantly more likely than whites of the same education level to be antisemitic. In the 1998 survey, blacks (34%) were nearly four times as likely as whites (9%) to fall into the most antisemitic category (those agreeing with at least 6 of 11 statements that were potentially or clearly antisemitic). Among blacks with no college education, 43% fell into the most antisemitic group (vs. 18% for the general population), which fell to 27% among blacks with some college education, and 18% among blacks with a four-year college degree (vs. 5% for the general population).(Anti-Defamation League Survey http://www.adl.org/antisemitism_survey/survey_print.asp.)The 2005 Anti-Defamation League survey includes data on Hispanic attitudes, with 29% being most antisemitic (vs. 9% for whites and 36% for blacks); being born in the United States helped alleviate this attitude: 35% of foreign-born Hispanics, but only 19% of those born in the US.(Anti-Defamation League Survey http://www.adl.org/PresRele/ASUS_12/4680_12.htm.)Religious tensions continued to exist in the United States, but numerous polls indicated that Jews were no longer the focus of hostility, and indeed that antisemitism is at a low point in the U.S.  As an example of religious tension, in 2010 widespread debate erupted over building an Islamic cultural center and mosque in New York City near the Trade Center site.  The city of New York has officially endorsed the project, but public opinion nationwide has been hostile.  A (magazine) poll in August 2010 of 1000 individuals indicated that 13 percent hold unfavorable views of Jews, compared with 43 percent who had unfavorable views of Muslims, 17 percent who felt unfavorably toward Catholics and 29 percent who viewed Mormons unfavorably.()() By contrast, antisemitic attitudes are much higher in Europe and are growing.()See also*Movement*of the Jews in the American West*of American Jews*American Heritage Month*States military chaplain symbols, includes information on history of insignia for Jewish chaplain in U.S. militaryNotes and referencesFurther readingSurveys* The Jewish People in America  5 vol 1992** Faber, Eli.

Richard_Sorge
laterworkRichard Sorge  (October 4, 1895 &ndash; November 7, 1944) was a German communist and spy who worked for the Union. He has gained great fame among espionage enthusiasts for his intelligence gathering during War II.  He worked as a journalist in both Germany and Japan, where he was imprisoned for spying and eventually hanged. His GRU codename was Ramsay (). He is widely regarded as one of the best-known Soviet intelligence officers of the Second World War, according to Phillip Knightley, the author of The Second Oldest Profession (1986). Early life thumb|200px|Richard Sorge in the 1940s.Sorge was born in the settlement of Sabunchi,(Hero of the Soviet Union Richard Sorge)(Khrono.ru. Richard Sorge) suburb of Baku, Azerbaijan, which was part of Russia at the time. He was the youngest of the nine children of Wilhelm Richard Sorge (d. 1907) a German mining engineer and his Russian wife Nina Semionovna Kobieleva.(Deakin and Storry, p. 23)  His fathers lucrative contract with the Caucasian Oil Company having expired, Richard Sorges family moved back to Germany: in Sorges own words,The one thing that made my life a little different from the average was a strong awareness of the fact that I had been born in the southern Caucasus and that we had moved to Berlin when I was very small.(Partial Memoirs of Richard Sorge, Part 2, p. 30; quoted in part by Prange according to whom Sorge was 11 when the family moved (Prange, p. 8 and Appendix Chronology) and in full by Whymant according to whom Sorge was two years old at the time of the move (Whymant, p. 11); Whymant refers to a glimmering memory of this ambiance the southern Caucasus as staying with Sorge for the rest of his life which rather suggests that two years old is a somewhat low estimate of Sorges age at the time of the move)  The cosmopolitan Sorge household was very different from the average bourgeois home in Berlin.(quoted by Whymant, p. 12)Although Sorge considered Adolf Sorge, an associate of Marx and Engels, to be his grandfather, he was in fact his great-uncle.(Deakin and Storry, pp. 23-24; quoted by Prange)In October 1914 Sorge volunteered to serve during War I. He joined a student battalion of the 3rd Guards, Artillery. During his service in the Western Front he was severely wounded in March 1916 when shrapnel cut off three of his fingers and broke both his legs, causing a lifelong limp. He was promoted to corporal, received an Cross and later medically discharged. During his convalescence he read Marx and adopted communist ideology, mainly due to the influence of the father of a nurse with whom he had developed a relationship. He spent the rest of the war studying economics at the universities of Berlin, Kiel and Hamburg.  Sorge received a Ph.D. in science at the of Hamburg in August 1919.(Prange, Appendix Chronology)  He also joined the Party of Germany. His political views, however, got him fired from both a teaching job and mining work. He fled to Moscow where he became a junior agent for Comintern. Red Army spy Sorge was recruited as a spy for the Union and using the cover of being a journalist he was sent to various European countries to assess the possibility of communist uprisings taking place. From 1920 to 1922, Sorge lived in Solingen, in present-day Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. He was joined there by Christiane Gerlach who had been the wife of Dr Albert Gerlach, a wealthy communist who had also been Sorges professor of political science in Kiel. Sorge and Christiane married in May 1921.  In 1922, he was relocated to Frankfurt, where he gathered intelligence about the business community. In the summer of 1923, he took part in the Erste Marxistische Arbeitswoche (First Marxist Work Week) in Ilmenau, Thuringia, an event subsidized by Weil. After an attempted communist coup in October 1923, Sorge continued his work as a journalist. At the same time, he helped with organizing the library of the for Social Research, of which Kurt Albert Gerlach was meant to be the first director. In 1924, he and Christiane moved to Moscow where he officially joined the International Liaison Department of the Comintern, also an OGPU intelligence gathering body.  Apparently, his dedication to duty led to his divorce. In 1929, Sorge became part of the Armys Fourth Department (the GRU, or military intelligence)(ibid.)  He remained with the Department for the rest of his life.In 1929 Sorge arrived in England to study the movements then prevalent in the region, the status of the Party of Great Britain, and the countrys political and economic conditions. He was instructed to remain undercover and not to become involved in politics while living in England. In November 1929 Sorge returned to Germany where he was instructed to join the Party and not to associate with left-wing activists. To help develop a cover for his spying activities he obtained a post working for the agricultural newspaper, Getreide-Zeitung.(Deakin, p. 63) China 1930 Sorge moved to Shanghai in 1930 to gather intelligence and foment revolution. Officially, he worked as the editor of a German news service and for the Zeitung. He contacted another spy, Clausen. Sorge also met German Soviet spy Kuczynski(Richard C.S. Trahair. Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies and Secret Operations. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004. ISBN 0313319553) and American journalist Smedley, both his lovers.(Focus.pl) Smedley, a well-known left-wing journalist, worked for the Zeitung. She introduced Sorge to Ozaki, who was employed by the Japanese newspaper, Shimbun. Later Ozaki agreed to join Sorges spy network, as well as Ishii,  Sorges next lover.(Former Soviet spy Sorges girlfriend Ishii dies)As a journalist, Sorge established himself as an expert on agriculture. This gave him the freedom to travel around the country making contacts with members of the Communist Party. In January 1932, Sorge reported on fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops in the streets of Shanghai. In December he was recalled to Moscow. Japan 1933 Image:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1976, MiNr Block 044.jpg|thumb|GDR postage stamp commemorating Richard SorgeIn May 1933, the Soviet Union decided to have Sorge organize a spy network in Japan. As a cover, he was sent to Berlin with the code name Ramsay ( (Ramzai, Ramzay)), to renew contacts in Germany so he could pass as a German journalist in Japan. In Berlin, he insinuated himself into Nazi ranks, read much Nazi propaganda, in particular Hitlers Mein Kampf, and attended so many beer halls with his new acquaintances that he gave up drinking lest his tongue be loosened by alcohol. His total abstinence does not appear to have made his Nazi companions suspicious and was an example of his devotion to and absorption in his mission.  He later explained to Massing, That was the bravest thing I ever did.   Never will I be able to drink enough to make up for this time.(Massing, This Deception (New York, 1951), p. 71; quoted by Prange)  Sorge was a heavy drinker and, later, his drinking came to undermine his work.  While in Germany, he was able to get commissions from two newspapers, the Zeitung and the Rundschau. He also got support from the Nazi theoretical journal, Geopolitik. Later he was to get work from the Frankfurter Zeitung.Sorge arrived in Yokohama on September 6, 1933. He was warned by his spymaster not to have contact with the underground Japanese Communist Party or with the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo. His spy network in Japan included Red Army officer and radio operator Gottfried Friedrich Clausen,(His name is often spelt with an initial K but Clausen appears on his driving licence and as his signature - Charles A. Willoughby, Shanghai Conspiracy (New York, 1952), photograph at p.75; referred to by Prange) Ozaki, and two other Comintern agents, Branko Vukelic, a journalist working for the French magazine, Vu and a Japanese journalist, Yotoku, who was employed by the English-language newspaper, the Japan Advertiser. Max Clausens wife Anna acted as ring courier from time to time.  From summer 1937, Clausen the spy operated under cover of his firm set up with Soviet funds but which in time became a commercial success, M Clausen Shokai suppliers of blueprint machinery and reproduction services.Sorge built a network in 1933 and 1934 to collect intelligence for the GRU in Japan. His agents had contacts with senior politicians and through that, to information of Japans policy. He also recontacted Ozaki who developed a close contact with the prime minister Konoe. Ozaki copied secret documents for Sorge. Collecting intelligence from inside Germany was more dangerous and difficult at the time, so Sorge was sent to Japan to collect information on Germanys plans. This was a similar tactic with the other soviet rings spying on Germany. The evidence of his communist past in German security files was overlooked, or hidden, according to Prange.Officially, Sorge joined the Nazi party and became a German journalist in Tokyo, where he came to work closely with the German embassy and ambassador Eugen Ott. He used the embassy for double-checking his information, having access to telegrams in Otts office. He even had an affair with Otts wife, proof that he was entirely trusted at the embassy, but the stress also increased his drinking.Wartime intelligence supplied by the Sorge RingSorge supplied the Soviet Red Army with information about the Pact, the Pact and warned of the Pearl Harbor attack. In 1941, Sorge is said to have informed them of the exact launch date of Barbarossa. Moscow answered with thanks but Stalin largely ignored it,(http://hnn.us/roundup/comments/11994.html) as was  also the case with information supplied by the other networks, including Dombs Red Orchestra spy network on the German Borders.  Stalin was reportedly so angry with Dombs information that he ordered that Domb be punished for spreading such lies. (The order was not followed). Gordon Pranges analysis (1984) was that the closest Sorge came to predicting the launch date of Barbarossa was 20 June 1941 and Prange comments that Sorge himself never claimed to have discovered the correct date (22 June) in advance.(Prange, p. 347)  The date of 20 June had been given to Sorge by Lt-Col Friedrich von Schol who was assistant military attache at the German embassy in Tokyo.(Obi Toshito, ed., Gendai-shi Shiryo, Zoruge Jiken (Materials on Modern History, The Sorge Incident) (Tokyo, 1962), Vol. I, p.274; quoted by Prange) As Sorge took pride in and sought the credit for the spy rings work, Professor Prange may have taken Sorges failure to claim that he had discovered the correct date as conclusive evidence that Sorge in fact did fail to discover it. Kim Philbys recruiter A. Deutsch was also the spymaster of Gestapo officer Lehmann, who on June 19 cabled the Barbarossa launch date to NKVD in Moscow. Stalin considered this as disinformation, too.The Soviet press reported in 1964 that on June 15, 1941, Sorge had broadcast a dispatch saying that, The war will begin on June 22.(I. Dementieva and N. Agayantz, Richard Sorge, Soviet Intelligence Agent, Sovietskaya Rossiya, 6 September 1964; quoted by Prange) Writing before previously-embargoed material was released by the Russian authorities in the 1990s, Prange and those writing with him appear not to have accepted the veracity of this report.  More recently, Stalin was quoted as having ridiculed Sorge and his intelligence prior to the launch of Barbarossa:Theres this bastard whos set up factories and brothels in Japan and even deigned to report the date of the German attack as 22 June. Are you suggesting I should believe him too?  (Sebag Montefiore Stalin The Court of the Red Tsar (London, 2003), p. 360; referred to in the Notes below as Sebag Montefiore)Sorge advised the Red Army on September 14, 1941, that the Japanese were not going to attack the Soviet Union until:# Moscow was captured# the size of the Army was three times that of the Soviet Unions Far Eastern forces# a civil war had started in Siberia.(Prange, p. 407)Sorge transmitted information toward the end of September 1941 that Japan was not going to attack the Soviet Union in the East.This information made possible the transfer of Soviet divisions from the Far East, although the presence of the Army in Manchuria necessitated the Soviet Unions keeping a large number of troops on the eastern borders...(Mayevsky, Viktor, Comrade Richard Sorge, Pravda, 4 September 1964; quoted by Prange)  Various writers have speculated that this information allowed the release of Siberian divisions for the of Moscow, where the German army suffered its first tactical defeat in the war. To this end, Sorges information might have been the most important spy work in World War II. At Khimki, a place at the Moscow city border en route to International Airport, there is still a memorial plaque reminding visitors of this defining point of modern history.The second most important piece of information he allegedly passed along concerned the of Stalingrad - the turning point in the war which is considered one of the bloodiest and largest battles in history. Richard Sorge alerted Moscow that Japan would attack the Soviet Union from the East as soon as the German army captured any city on the Volga, thus effectively disrupting oil supplies from Baku and also ammunition and food supplies sent by the allies from the Gulf through Iran, Soviet Azerbaijan and up the Volga river.(Whymant, p. 206) However, by mid-1941 the Japanese had made their strategic decision to go south and east, instead of north, so the information (if given) seems to have been speculative at best.Arrests and trialsAs the war progressed, it was becoming increasingly dangerous for Sorge to continue his spying work. Nevertheless, in view of the critical juncture of the war, he continued spying. However, due to the increasing volume of radio traffic from pads (used by the Soviets), the Japanese began to suspect a spy ring operating. The secret service had already intercepted many of his messages and begun to close in. Ozaki was arrested on October 14, 1941, and interrogated. Sorge was arrested on October 18, 1941, in Tokyo. German ambassador Eugen Ott heard of Sorges arrest the next day from a brief memo notifying him that Sorge had been arrested on suspicion of espionage together with another German, Max Clausen. Ott was both surprised and outraged, and assumed it was a case of Japanese espionage hysteria. He thought that Sorge had been discovered passing secret information on the Japan-US negotiations to the German embassy, and also that the arrest could be due to anti-German elements in the Japanese government. It was not until a few months later that Japanese authorities announced that Sorge had in fact been indicted as a Soviet spy.(Whymant, p. 283)Initially, the  Japanese believed that, due to his Nazi party membership and German ties, Sorge was an Abwehr agent. However, the Abwehr denied that he was one of their agents. Even under torture, he denied all ties with the Soviets. The Japanese made three overtures to the Soviets, offering to trade Sorge for one of their own spies. However, the Soviets declined all the offers, maintaining that Sorge was unknown to them.( He was incarcerated in Prison.ExecutionRichard Sorge was hanged on November 7, 1944, at 10:20 a.m. Tokyo time in Prison; Hotsumi Ozaki was hanged earlier in the same day. The Soviet Union did not officially acknowledge Sorge until 1964. It was argued that Sorges biggest coup led to his undoing, because Stalin could not afford to let it become known that he had rejected his intelligence data about the German attack in 1941. However, it should also be mentioned that nations seldom officially recognize their own spies.(Corkill, Edan, Sorges spy is brought in from the cold, Times, 31 January 2010, p. 7.)Sorge was survived by his mother, then living in Germany, and he left his estate to Anna Clausen.(Interview with Sorges defence lawyer Sumitsugu Asanuma conducted on Pranges behalf by Ms. Chi Harada; quoted by Prange) He was buried in the Sugamo Prison (Zhogaya) graveyard,(ibid.) but his remains were later relocated to Cemetery in Tokyo. His lover Ishii continued to visit his grave until her death in 2000.Posthumous recognitionthumb|190px|right|Sorge monument in Baku with bullet-like holes.In 1954 the German film director Harlan wrote and directed the film Betrayal of Germany (Verrat an Deutschland) about Sorges espionage in Japan. In Nazi Germany Harlan was the favourite filmmaker of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and director of numerous propaganda films, including the antisemitic reel Sss. Harlans film about Sorge is a romantic drama, with Harlans wife Sderbaum, also known for numerous propaganda pieces in Nazi Germany, as the main protagonist of Sorge. The film was prohibited in Germany only two days after its release in 1955 and only released again after re-editing.(http://www.ikdb.de/filme/film_verrat_an_deutschland.html) In 1961 a movie called Qui tes-vous, Monsieur Sorge? (Who Are You, Mr. Sorge?) was produced in France in collaboration with Germany, Italy and Japan.  This movie was very popular in the Union as well. The part of Sorge was played by Holtzmann. In 1964, Soviet premier Khrushchev saw the film and asked the KGB whether the story was true. When it was confirmed that it was indeed true, Khrushchev posthumously awarded Sorge with the title of of the Soviet Union on 5 November 1964. Sorges widow Hanako Ishii received a Soviet pension. She eventually died in July 2000 in Tokyo.()Three East German journalists wrote Dr. Sorge funkt aus Tokyo in 1965 in celebration of the half-Russian, half-German hero who had acted against fascism (Germany and the Soviet Union were then allied in the Pact). In the lead up to the award, Sorges claim that Adolf Sorge was his grandfather was gladly repeated in the Soviet press.(Mayevsky, Viktor, Comrade Richard Sorge, Pravda, 4 September 1964, p. 4; quoted by Prange) In a strange cold war oddity, these authors stirred up a free speech scandal with patriotic letters to former Nazis in West Germany, causing the Verfassungsschutz to issue a stern warning in early 1967: If you receive mail from a certain Mader, do not reply to him and pass on the letter to the respective security authorities.(Industrie-Warndienst, Bonn/Frankfurt/Main, Nr. 12 vom 21. April 1967, cit. nach Julius Mader: Hitlers Spionagegenerale sagen aus, 5. Aufl. 1973, S.9f)A comic book based on Sorges life, titled Wywiadowca XX wieku (20th Century Spy), was published in 1971 in Poland to familiarize younger readers with Sorge.Sorge also appears in Tezukas Adolf manga.Author Pincher, in his 1981 book Their Trade is Treachery, asserted that Sorge, a GRU spy himself, recruited Englishman Hollis in China in the early 1930s to spy for the GRU. Hollis later returned to England, joined MI5 just before War II began, and eventually became Director-General of MI5 from 1956 to 1965. As detailed by former MI5 staffer Wright in his 1988 book Spycatcher, Hollis was accused of being a Soviet spy, but despite several lengthy and seemingly thorough investigations, no conclusive proof of this was ever obtained.  One of Hemons first stories in English is The Sorge Spy Ring (Triquarterly, 1997).  The 2003 Japanese film Sorge, directed by Masahiro Shinoda, details his exploits in Shanghai and Japan. In the film he is portrayed by Scottish actor Glen.(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316665/)Quotes*A devastating example of a brilliant success of espionage. - MacArthur, General of the Army*His work was impeccable. - Philby*In my whole life, I have never met anyone as great as he was. - Mitsusada Yoshikawa, Chief Prosecutor in the Sorge trials who obtained Sorges death sentence.*Sorge was the man whom I regard as the most formidable spy in history. - Fleming*Richard Sorge was the best spy of all time. - Clancy*The spy who changed the world. - Morrow*Somehow, amidst the Bonds and People, we have ignored the greatest of 20th century spy stories - that of Stalins Sorge, whose exploits helped change history. - Bernstein*Richard Sorges brilliant espionage work saved Stalin and the Soviet Union from defeat in the fall of 1941, probably prevented a Nazi victory in World War Two and thereby assured the dimensions of the world we live in today. - Larry Collins*The spies in history who can say from their graves, the information I supplied to my masters, for better or worse, altered the history of our planet, can be counted on the fingers of one hand.

Bill_Withers
 website           billwithersmusic.com William Harrison Bill Withers, Jr. (born July 4, 1938) is an American singer-songwriter and musician who performed and recorded from 1970 until 1985. Some of his best-known songs are Lean on Me, No Sunshine, Use Me, Just the Two of Us, Lovely Day, and Hands.  His life was recently the subject of the documentary film Still Bill.Early lifeWithers was born the youngest of  thirteen children in the small coal-mining town of Fork, West Virginia. Raised in nearby West Virginia, Withers was thirteen years old when his father died. He enlisted with the States Navy at age eighteen and served for nine years, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs.  Soon after his discharge from the Navy in 1970, he relocated to Los Angeles for a musical career.()Withers worked as an assembler for several different companies, including Aircraft Corporation, while recording demo tapes with his own money, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he debuted with the song No Sunshine he refused to resign his job because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other acts.CareerSussex RecordsDuring early 1970, Withers demonstration tape was audited favorably by Avant of Records. Avant signed Withers to a record deal and assigned T. Jones to produce Withers first album. Four three-hour studio sessions were planned to record the album, but funding caused the album to be recorded in three sessions with a six-month break between the second and final sessions. Just as I Am was released in 1971 with the tracks Aint No Sunshine and Hands as singles. The album features Stills playing lead guitar.()The album was a success and Withers began touring with a band assembled from members of The Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band: drummer Gadson, guitarist Benorce Blackmon, keyboardist Ray Jackson, and bassist Melvin Dunlap.At the 14th annual Awards on Tuesday, March 14, 1972, Withers won a Award for Best R&B Song for No Sunshine. The track had already sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in September 1971.()During a hiatus from touring, Withers recorded his second album, Still Bill. The single Lean on Me went to number one the week of July 8, 1972. It was Withers second gold disc awarded track with confirmed sales in excess of three million.( His single Use Me released in August 1972, became his third million seller, with the R.I.A.A. gold disc award taking place on October 12, 1972.( A Friday, October 6, 1972 performance on a rainy night was recorded for the live album Bill Withers, Live at Carnegie Hall released November 30, 1972.  In 1974 Withers recorded the album +Justments. But he became involved in a legal dispute with the Sussex company and was unable to record thereafter.During this time, he wrote and produced two songs on the Knight & the Pips record Feel a Song, and in October 1974 performed in concert together with Brown, James, and B. King at the historic Rumble in the Jungle fight between Foreman and Ali in Zaire.() Footage of his performance was included in the 1996 film, We Were Kings, and he is heard on the accompanying soundtrack.Columbia RecordsWithers signed with Records in 1975. His first release with the label, Making Music, Making Friends, included the single Shes Lonely which was featured in the film for Mr. Goodbar. During the next three years he released an album each year with Naked & Warm (1976), Menagerie (1977, containing the successful Lovely Day) and Love (1978) and On Down, the latter song was also on for Mr. Goodbar soundtrack.Due to problems with Columbia, he concentrated on joint projects between 1977 and 1985, including the successful Just the Two of Us, with jazz saxophonist Washington, Jr., which was released during June 1980. It won a Grammy on February 24, 1982. Withers next did Soul Shadows with Crusaders, and In the Name of Love with MacDonald, the latter being nominated for a Grammy for vocal performance.In 1985 came Watching You, Watching Me, which featured the 40 rated Rhythm&Blues single Oh Yeah. Withers ended his business association with Columbia Records after this release, which as of 2010 is his last studio album.In 1988, a new version of Lovely Day from the 1977 Menagerie album, titled Lovely Day (Sunshine Mix) and remixed by Liebrand, reached the Top 10 in the Kingdom, leading to Withers  performance on the long-running of the Pops that year. The original release had scored #2 in the UK in 1973, and the re-release scored to #1.In 1987, he received his ninth Grammy award nomination and on March 2, 1988 his third Grammy for Best Rhythm and Blues Song as songwriter for the re-recording of Lean On Me by Nouveau on their debut album Life, Love and Pain, released in 1986 on Bros. Records.In 1996, a portion of his song Grandmas Hands was sampled in the song Diggity by BLACKstreet, featuring Dr. Dre. The single went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and sold 1.6 million copies and won a Grammy in 1999 for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.Withers contributed two songs to Jimmy Buffetts July 13, 2004 release License To Chill.  Following the reissues of Still Bill on 28, 2003 and Just As I Am on March 8, 2005, there was speculation of previously unreleased material being issued as a new album.(Mitchell, Gail (2005-10-14). Withers In No Hurry To Make New Album. Billboard.) In 2006, Sony gave back to Withers his previously unreleased tapes.In 2007, Lean On Me was inducted into the Hall of Fame.Personal lifeWithers married actress Nicholas in 1973, during her stint as the main actress of the popular sitcom, 222. The couple did not have any children and divorced the next year.During the professional semi-hiatus which began in the late 1970s, Withers concentrated more on personal matters than professional recording. In 1976, he married Marcia Johnson and they had two children, Todd and Kori.
