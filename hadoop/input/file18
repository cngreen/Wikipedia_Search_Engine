Gold_Commissioner
Gold Commissioner was an important regional administrative post in the of British Columbia.  In the 1860s, Governor Douglas had three priorities to protect the two colonies he governed:(The of Vancouver Island and the Colony of British Columbia) to protect the boundaries, to uphold law and order and to provide access to the gold fields.  In 1859, the War together with War the previous year, underlined concerns that American settlers might challenge the British jurisdictions.  After the native population in the Territory was crushed and the area was opened to settlement, its non-native population grew rapidly to more than 11,000.    General William Harney, after meeting with Douglas, reported to Washington that the population of the colony was largely American with few British and that it would soon be a commercial necessity for the colonists to yield Vancouver Island to the U.S. government.  In these circumstances, Douglas enhanced the limited military capability of the Royal Engineers and developed the office of Gold Commissioner buttressed by the periodic visits of a traveling judge.The ten Commissioners were appointed to specific geographic jurisdictions. Their primary role was to issue mining licences and register gold claims.  The commissioners also acted as agents of everyday authority.  They settled mining disputes, collected government revenues, oversaw land claims, served as electoral officers and dealt with the natives.  They displayed the British flag.()  They acted as a receiver-cashier for gold, which was held until the Escort could deliver it to the capital.  A Gold Commissioners powers and duties also encompassed the duties of Government Agent, Indian Agent, magistrate, Commissioner, surveyor, sheriff, coroner and other duties.  The powers of a Gold Commissioner within his designated jurisdiction were second only to the Governor.  The position remained as a fixture in the new province when the colony joined Canada in 1871 although by the end of War I nearly all Gold Commissioner positions had been devolved to separate offices, with the bulk of the offices power and legacy inherited by the  Government Agent, who typically was also Indian Agent as well as Mines Commissioner, which was a post associated with each of the mining districts.ReferencesOther sources*McGowans War, Donald J.

Breaker_boy
Image:Breaker boys, Eagle Hill colliery, eastern PA 1.jpg|Breaker boys|thumb|right|Breaker boys at the Eagle Hill colliery near Pennsylvania. George Bretz photo, 1884.A breaker boy was a coal-mining worker in the States(Hindman, Hugh D. Child Labor: An American History. Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 2002. ISBN 0765609363) and Kingdom whose job was to separate impurities from coal by hand in a breaker. Although breaker boys were primarily children, elderly coal miners who could no longer work in the mines because of age, disease, or accident were also sometimes employed as breaker boys.(This gave rise to a saying among coal miners: Once an adult, twice a boy. See: Miller, Donald L. and Sharpless, Richard E. The Kingdom of Coal: Work, Enterprise, and Ethnic Communities in the Mine Fields. State College, Pa.: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1985. ISBN 0812279913; McDowell, John. The Life of a Coal Miner. In The Worlds Work...: A History of Our Time. Vol. 4. Walter Hines Page and Arthur Wilson Page, eds. New York: Doubleday, Page & Company, 1902; Richards, John Stuart. Early Coal Mining in the Anthracite Region. Mount Pleasant, S.C.: Arcadia Publishing, 2002. ISBN 0738509787) The use of breaker boys began in the mid-1860s.(( Although public disapproval of the employment of children as breaker boys existed by the mid-1880s, the practice did not end until the 1920s.((Coal breakingFile:Charles Green06.jpg|thumb|Breaker boyby GreenThe first function of a coal breaker is to break coal into pieces and sort these pieces into categories of nearly uniform size, a process known as breaking.(Ketchum, Milo Smith. The Design of Mine Structures. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1912.) But coal is often mixed with impurities such as rock, slate, sulphur, ash (or bone), clay, or soil.((Ash are impurities such as alumina, iron, silica, and other noncombustible materials. See: Ash. Dictionary of Energy. June 30, 2007. Accessed 2009-10-31.) Thus, the second function of a coal breaker is to remove as many impurities as economically desirable and technologically feasible, and then grade the coal based on the percent of impurities remaining.(In the U.S. prior to 1830, bituminous and anthracite coal underwent little processing before being sent to market. The miner himself would use a sledgehammer to break up large lumps of coal, then use a rake whose teeth were set two inches apart to collect the larger pieces of coal for shipment to the surface.(Korson, George Gershon. Black Rock: Mining Folklore of the Pennsylvania Dutch. Manchester, N.H.: Ayer Publishing, 1950. ISBN 0405106076) The smaller lumps of coal were considered nonmarketable and left in the mine.( Beginning about 1830, surface processing of coal began. Lumps of coal were placed on plates of perforated iron and breakers would hammer on the coal until it was in pieces small enough to fall through the holes.( A second screen caught the coal, and was shaken (by hand, animal, steam, or water power) to remove the unmarketable smaller lumps.( This broken and screened coal was worth much more than broken coal or lump coal.(Use of breaker boysImage:Boys picking slate from coal. packer -5 breaker.jpg|Breaker boys|thumb|right|Breaker boys in the 1880s picking slate from coal at a coal breaker in Pennsylvania. Photo by George Bretz, 1880sUntil about 1900, nearly all coal breaking facilities in the United States were labor-intensive. The removal of impurities was done by hand, usually by breaker boys between the ages of eight and 12 years old.(Freedman, Russell. Kids at Work: Lewis Hine and the Crusade Against Child Labor.

International Library of Technology: A Series of Textbooks for Persons Engaged in the Engineering Professions and Trades. Vol. 38. Scranton, Pa.: International Textbook Co., 1903.) For 10 hours a day, six days a week, breaker boys would sit on wooden seats, perched over the chutes and conveyor belts, picking slate and other impurities out of the coal.(((((Miller, Randall M. and Pencak, William. Pennsylvania: A History of the Commonwealth. State College, Pa.: Penn State Press, 2003. ISBN 0271022140)(Novak, Michael. The Guns of Lattimer. Reprint ed. New York: Transaction Publishers, 1996.

ISBN 0791420876) Breaker boys working on top of chutes or conveyor belts would stop the coal by pushing their boots into the stream of fuel flowing beneath them, briefly pick out the impurities, and then let the coal pass on to the next breaker boy for further processing.((Bartoletti, Susan Campbell. Growing Up in Coal Country. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1999. ISBN 0395979145) Others would divert coal into a horizontal chute at which they sat, then pick the coal clean before allowing the fuel to flow into clean coal bins.(The work performed by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys were forced to work without gloves so that they could better handle the slick coal.((( The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding.((( Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts.(((( Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears.(((( Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only at the end of the working day.(((( Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered.(((( Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common.((((( Coal was often washed(When coal is mixed with water, a chemical reaction occurs that generates acid on the surface of the coal.) or treated with acid to remove impurities,(Daniels, F.E. Acid Pollution of Streams. Journal of the American Water Works Association. 1921; Stimulation of Free Settling by Electrolysis. Mining and Metallurgy.

ISBN 0812971302)Public condemnationFile:Pennsylvania breaker boys 1911.jpg|thumb|Breaker boys sort coal in at an anthracite coal breaker near South Pennsylvania, 1911.Public condemnation of the use of breaker boys was so widespread that in 1885 Pennsylvania enacted a law forbidding the employment of anyone under the age of 12 from working in a coal breaker,(( but the law was poorly enforced; many employers forged proof-of-age documentation, and many families forged birth certificates or other documents so their children could support the family.(( Estimates of the number of breaker boys at work in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania vary widely, and official statistics are generally considered by historians to undercount the numbers significantly.( One estimate had 20,000 breaker boys working in the state in 1880,( 18,000 working in 1900,( 13,133 working in 1902,( and 24,000 working in 1907.(Install Mechanical Slate Pickers. Technical World Magazine. September 1906-February 1907.) Technological innovations in the 1890s and 1900s (such as mechanical and water separators designed to remove impurities from coal) dramatically lowered the need for breaker boys,((A Great and Efficient Coal Breaker. New York Times. January 6, 1895.) but adoption of the new technology was slow.(By the 1910s, the use of breaker boys was dropping because of improvements in technology, stricter child labor laws, and the enactment of education laws.(( The practice of employing children in coal breakers largely ended by 1920 because of the efforts of the Child Labor Committee, sociologist and photographer Hine, and the Consumers League, all of whom educated the public about the practice and succeeded in obtaining passage of national child labor laws.(((Cohen, David and Wels, Susan. America Then & Now: Great Old Photographs of Americas Life and Times, and How Those Same Scenes Look Today. New York: HarperCollins, 1992.

Heiligenblut
Heiligenblut (meaning holy blood) is a municipality in the district of Spittal an der Drau in the Austrian state of Carinthia. Situated in the high-Alpine region of the Tauern range at 1,288 meters, Heiligenblut is located at the foot of the Groglockner, the highest mountain in Austria, and the Glacier. It is also the southern starting point of the scenic Hochalpenstrae to Bruck in Salzburg, the continuation of the highway B107 from Lienz in Tyrol. The municipality of Heiligenblut includes the Katastralgemeinden of Apriach, Hof, Rojach and Zlapp.thumb|260px|left|Heiligenblut and GroglocknerThe Gothic pilgrimage church of Saint Vinzenz, with its needle spire, was built between 1460-1491 and contains a relic of Christs Holy Blood. According to legend the relic, which is kept in a sacrament house, was brought here in 914 from Constantinople by the Danish knight Briccius. On his way home he was buried by an avalanche and his corpse was found where three ears of wheat broke through the snow (see the of arms). The church also houses a late-Gothic winged altarpiece from 1520, and a crypt and tomb containing the remains of Briccius.Once a mining area from history to the Ages, Heiligenblut nowadays chiefly is a tourism and mountaineering resort. Nearby attractions include the Heiligenblut-Robach-Schareck cable car (2,606 m), an open-air museum, the Stockmhlen mills in Apriach with nine flume mills, Lake Kachelsee to the west, the Mll waterfalls, the Gnitz waterfalls, the Leiter waterfalls, the Margaritzen reservoir, and Lake Sandersee.The construction of the nearby railway tunnel to the Fleialm mountain area (1,798 m) is unique in Europe. The 1.6-kilometer long tunnel is filled with water during the summer but serves as a railway tunnel leading to the Fleialm winter sports region in winter.thumb|Heiligenblut viewed from the northwest (from the trail heading to Studlhutte refuge and towards Grossglockner)Twin towns* Sodankyl, Finland* California, StatesLiteratureKaufmann, J.: rtliche Entwicklung und Ortsbild der Gemeinde Heiligenblut am Groglockner (masters thesis), Vienna, 1984.cs:Heiligenblutda:Heiligenblutam Groglockner(Carinthie)fur:Heiligenblutit:Heiligenblutnl:Heiligenblut(Carntia)()sk:Heiligenblutsl:Heiligenblutsv:Heiligenblutvo:Heiligenblutwar:Heiligenblut

Beacon_Heights,_Edmonton
Beacon Heights is a residential neighbourhood in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada that was part of the Town of Beverly before Beverly amalgamated with Edmonton in 1961.The earliest development in the neighbourhood occurred around 1910, several years before Beverly was incorporated as a town.(Herzog, p. 97)  According to the City of Edmontons neighborhood profile for Beacon Heights, one in ten of the residences in the neighbourhood were built by the end of War II, with half the dwellings being built before Beverlys amalgamation.Three out of four residences are single family dwellings, with most of the remainder being split almost equally between apartments in low rise buildings of under five stories and duplexes.  Roughly 85% of the single family dwellings are owner occupied, as are one in four of the duplexes.  The remainder are rented.The neighbourhood is bounded on the south by 118 Avenue, on the west by 50 Street, on the north by 122 Avenue, and on the east by 34 Street.Jubilee Park is located in Beacon Heights.  Jubilee Park is located on the site of the Beverly Coal Mine entrance, and was developed in 1955 as an Alberta Jubilee project.(The province of Alberta was 50 years old and celebrated its Jubilee in 1955.)Surrounding NeighbourhoodsBeverly Coal Mines in the Beacon Heights AreaThe Town of Beverly was a coal mining town with over twenty mines operating in the area during the towns history.

North_Warwickshire_and_Hinckley_College
North Warwickshire and Hinckley College is a Further Education College with campuses in Leicestershire, Nuneaton & Bedworth and North Warwickshire. It teaches a wide variety of learning programmes to students ranging from school students and Further Education students to adult and Higher Education learners.HistoryNorth Warwickshire College began in 1910 as the Nuneaton Technical College and the Nuneaton School of Art respectively, with the Technical College catering mainly to mining students. In 1913 the college moved to a larger building containing a laboratory, lecture room, drawing room and handicraft room only for the college to  close between 1914 and 1919 due to the World War. When the college reopened after the war it changed its structure to include general education courses, the college grew further and relocated again in 1923 and became the County Mining and Technical School in 1932. The size and scope of the education provided continued to grow over the next two decades and in 1952 the Art School was amalgamated with the college to form the Nuneaton Technical College and School of Art and in 1958 the main campus was relocated to Hinckley Road where it remains.The college was subsequently renamed to North Warwickshire College of Technology and Art until the merger with Hinckley College to become North Warwickshire and Hinckley College in 1996. On 2 December 2007 a fire broke out on the North Warwickshire site, starting in the first floor of the gymnasium and rapidly spreading to the outbuildings. The fire had destroyed around ten percent of the college building by the time it was extinguished.(College Fire: Arson Suspected) On 23 January 2009 a fire broke out in the roof on the Nuneaton site of the college. Water required to extinguish the fire has caused flooding, and officials have warned about potential problems that this could cause for certain courses.(Damage In College Fire)CompetitionsNorth Warwickshire & Hinckley College actively promotes a competitive spirit.Last year over 80 North Warwickshire & Hinckley Students registered and competed in competitions regionally and nationally.

The_Cornish_Times
The Cornish Times is a weekly newspaper, published every Friday from offices in Liskeard, Cornwall, United Kingdom. The offices are currently based in the former  Webbs  Hotel building (now called Webbs House). It covers all of East Cornwall, including Callington, Fowey, Liskeard, Looe, Saltash and Torpoint. It has the image of a chough as an emblem on its front page. It is owned by the Newspaper Group.HistoryThe Cornish Times was first published on Saturday 3 January 1857. A complete set of microfilm copies of The Cornish Times can be examined at the Studies Centre in Redruth.  Cover price of the first edition was one penny. Unlike today, it covered local and national as well as international news. Articles in the first edition included:*Petersburg, Russia, on a convention of Russia and Persia.*Copper ores for sale in Redruth*Mining information and activity around all of Cornwall*The address of the of USA*Crime in and Wear, England*The state of Nicaragua*Details of the execution of child murderer William Jackson, of Chester, England.The first publishers were E. Philp of Callington and J. Philp of Liskeard.(Facsimile of first edition, published free with The Cornish Times in 2007.)Webbs HotelThe current office building was built in 1833 as a hotel. The hotel was used for meetings of Caradon Mine. Under Cornish Laws cost book system, two monthly meetings were held at which the purser presented the accounts. The result of the meeting was the owners sharing the profits or meeting any debts, the calls. The owners names were held in cost books, from which their entry could be deleted after settling outstanding calls. The system existed until 1883. The hotel has featured in royal visits, parliamentary declarations and much more but was recently converted into flats and offices.The hotel is a Grade II listed building. It was abandoned and derelict in 1989, but a property developer purchased it in 2001 with plans to return it to its original state. It was reopened in 2005 to great local acclaim. As it is no longer a hotel, the building was renamed Webbs House. The area in front of the building has also been re-landscaped with granite seating, flower borders and a cross.References(External links*Cornish Times website

Manitou_Island_(Lake_Superior)
 additional info  Manitou Island is a small island in Superior, off the northeastern tip of the Peninsula in the state of Michigan. Located approximately three miles from the mainland, it encompasses around . Manitou has seen limited impact from human activity, due to its remote location and the often-treacherous waters caused by a strong current at the peninsulas tip. It is mostly forested, with scattered bogs and an inland lake known as Perch Lake. Dense underbrush can make travel around the island rather difficult, though a few unimproved trails do exist.The Land Trust protects  of the island as the Manitou Island Light Station Preserve.HistoryTest pits have been found on the island, hinting at a short-lived past as a possible mining site. Though trees abound, Manitous remoteness and its lack of quality timber make logging economically unfeasible. Commercial fisherman have used the island as a camping site in the past, staying overnight on the south beaches while setting their nets in the area. Today public access is facilitated by a timber and rock crib dock near the old lighthouse.Beginning in 2002, Manitou Island became the focus of an effort by local birdwatchers to explore and document the various avian species there. Approximately 203 separate species have been recorded, including large numbers of migratory raptors and waterbirds.  On the 24th of April 2006 we recorded over 1300 raptors in the air at one time!  Observers have also compiled a list of over 80 species as at least possible breeders.   Organized orservations by the Keweenaw Society are now happening regularly.(Manitou Island Bird Survey.) Efforts to investigate this unique habitat and its feathered residents are ongoing, in conjunction with the conservation activities of the Land Trust.The large number of avian visitors should be understood in the larger context of other sites around Michigan and the Great Lakes.  This would include Point Light, Point State Park and Point Light/Point Bird Observatory (which contains a lighthouse configured like this one).  Bird Areas are fond in many parts of Michigan.LighthousesManitou Island Light StationManitou Islands most important use to date has been the Manitou Island Light Station on its eastern tip. First built in 1849, this lighthouse is still in use, although it is unmanned and solar powered.

Scotch_Cattle
thumb|right|The name of the Scotch Cattle may have been inspired by the huge size, strength and toughness of certain Scottish breeds.Scotch Cattle was the name taken by bands of coal miners in 19th century Wales, analogous to the Maguires in Pennsylvania, who, in disguise, would visit the homes of other local miners who were working during a strike or cooperating with employers against the local mining community in other ways and punish them by ransacking their property or attacking them physically. They feature in Cordells book, set in this era, of the Fair Country against a backdrop of the Rising of 1839, Chartism and militancy in the Wales Valleys of the mid 19th century. Some members of these bands were probably idealists, but some also were merely looking for a chance to loot property from the groups targetsor even, in some cases, from bystanders.  Such groups may have been active as early as 1808, although their activity cannot be confirmed before 1822; the last confirmable reference to a Scotch Cattle raid dates from 1850. As late as 1926, however, pickets in the great strike of that year dressed themselves as Scotch Cattle, evoking the memory of the terroristic enforcement of solidarity that the Cattle had carried out in the past.(Francis, South Wales, 251)NameThe origins of the groups name have been lost, but several possible interpretations have been offered.  Some of the disguises worn by Scotch Cattle were actual cowskins, and this alone may have provided the name.  Alternatively, it may have been meant to evoke the fierceness of certain breeds of actual Scottish cattle such as cattle http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/258864, or may have referred ironically to a herd of Scottish cattle owned by a local mineowner in the early 19th century.MethodsThe central aim of the Cattle was to enforce solidarity among the mining community.  Men who worked during a strike might be warned by a posted notice that they were at risk of an attack; if the target did not comply, a Herd would visit his house in the night.  Composed of as many as 300 men and led by a Bull, the Herd would in most cases have been called in from a neighbouring town, to eliminate the possibility that the target might identify and report one of its members.  The members of the Herd would all wear disguises, although these varied widely in quality, ranging from elaborate cowhide costumes on the one hand to womens clothing and simple reversed jackets on the other.  After announcing their presence by blowing on horns and rattling chains, the Herd members would smash the houses doors, windows, and furniture and burn fabric items in a bonfire.  If the homeowner resisted, he would be beaten severely.  Firearms were used on occasion, but usually without serious effect; in one incident in 1834, however, a miners wife was killed by a visiting Herd, a crime for which one man was later executed and two imprisoned. Herds also on occasion looted truck shops, which were always a target of miners ire for their allegedly unfair price levels and monopoly on local business.  Less idealistically, the Herd might also raid and attack the homes of uninvolved families that happened to be located near the target home or businessand even some official raids were probably motivated more by the desire to plunder the targets house than the need to enforce solidarity.See also*Blackleg*Miner (song)References*Evans, E.W., The Miners of South Wales.

Montagu_Slater
Charles Montagu Slater (23 September 1902 &ndash; 19 December 1956) was an English poet, novelist, playwright and librettist.Slater, born in Millom, Cumberland, was selected by Britten as librettist for his opera Grimes, which was based on Letter XXII: Peter Grimes in Crabbes poem The Borough. For the libretto, Slater eschewed the traditional five-stress line form of English rhyming or blank verse in favour of a more modern and conversational four stress line with rhyming couplets.  He argued that contemporary listeners were accustomed to assonance and consonantal rhyme but it could also be argued that this form of rough rhyme was common in early English drama and that Slater was restoring it to the stage, rather than inventing something new.  Slaters original libretto, which he published himself (to the annoyance of Britten and Pears, who had made a number of amendments to it before the opera was staged), is cast in three acts.  It omits the repetitions necessary in the actual opera.  Slater was involved, with Britten and H. Auden, in many of the Grierson documentaries, such as Coal Face. He wrote the scripts for several films, including Brave Dont Cry (1952), about a mining disaster.(screenonline: Brave Dont Cry, The (1952))  Britten dedicated his Temporal Variations for oboe and piano to Slater, and his Ballad of Heroes to Slater and his wife Enid.Montagu Slater was known for his left wing political writings and communist sympathies in addition to his creative works. He wrote the miners strike drama Stay Down, Miner (1937).  He died in London. The literary papers and correspondence of Montagu Slater are held at The of Nottingham.ReferencesExternal links*Manuscript pages of Peter Grimes*FilmographySlaterSlater

Clearfield_Coalfield
The Clearfield Coalfield is a coal mining area in County, Pennsylvania, USA.  The coal seams are found in most parts of Clearfield County, with the notable exception of the northern part of the county. Mining historyThe entrance of the Railroads extension from Tyrone, northwest to Philipsburg and Clearfield opened much of the field to coal mining. Later the York Central (NYC) built their Beech Creek Extension from Shore up Creek and entered Clearfield from the northeast. This line bypassed Clearfield and extended south to Mahaffey and eventually into County. Other rail lines included the Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroads extension down Creek to Clearfield, NYCs extension to Clearfield and down the River to Keating, and the Gap Railroad, which ran through the southern part of the county through Mahaffey. Each railroad opened numerous coal company towns such as Surveyor, Croft, Karthus and Bald Hill on NYCs Susquehanna River line. Numerous other towns were built such as Gaazam, Glen Richey, Peale, Winburne (Summerville), Hawk Run, Morrisdale and Irvona. The active mining of these fields has been greatly reduced since the 1970s. Some coal is obtained via strip-mining for the power plant at Shawville and other private enterprises.  There are no active underground mines in Clearfield County as of 2007.

Cornish_folklore
thumb|The Merry Maidens at St BuryanImage:Stpiraninpenwith.JPG|thumb|right|Celebrating Pirans Day in PenzanceCornish folklore is the folk tradition which has developed in Cornwall. There is much traditional folklore in Cornwall, often tales of giants, mermaids, Bucca, piskies or the pobel vean (little people.) These are still surprisingly popular today, with many events hosting a droll teller(Cornish Folk Tales, Mike OConnor (Kernow)) to tell the stories: such myths and stories have found much publishing success, particularly in childrens books. The fairy tale the Giant Killer takes place in Cornwall. Many early British legends associate Arthur with Cornwall putting his birthplace at Tintagel, the court of his uncle King of Cornwall, father of Tristan & Iseult the most famous Cornish lovers.OverviewCornwall shares its ancient cultural heritage with its Brythonic cousins Brittany and Wales, as well as Ireland and parts of England such as neighbouring Devon. Many ancient tales of the Bards, whether the Cycle, and Iseult or Mabinogion take place in the ancient kingdom of Cerniw between Greater and Lesser Britains with a foot on either side of the British Sea Mor Brettanek/Mor Breizh.Part of Cornish folklore is derived from tales of sea-faring pirates and smugglers who thrived in and around Cornwall from the early modern period through to the 19th century. Cornish pirates exploited both their knowledge of the Cornish coastline as well as its sheltered creeks and hidden anchorages. For many villages, loot and contraband provided by pirates supported a strong and secretive economy in Cornwall.()creatures that appear in Cornish folklore include buccas, knockers and piskies.() Tales of these creatures are thought to have developed as supernatural explanations for the frequent and deadly cave-ins that occurred during 18th century Cornish tin mining, or else a creation of the oxygen-starved minds of exhausted miners who returned from the underground.The knocker or bucca (Cornish) is the Welsh and Cornish equivalent of Irish leprechauns and English and Scottish brownies. About two feet tall and grizzled, but not misshapen, they live beneath the ground. Here they wear tiny versions of standard miners garb and commit random mischief, such as stealing a miners unattended tools and food - they were often cast a small offering of food - usually the crust of a pasty to appease their malevolence.;Weather loreMist from the hill / Brings water for the mill; / Mist from the sea /Brings fine weather for me.(Holloway, John, ed. (1987) The Oxford Book of Local Verses. Oxford U. P.; p. 104) Lundy plain, Sign of rain (current in north Cornwall where Lundy Island is normally visible).Enys TregarthenNellie Sloggett of Padstow devoted much of her attention to Cornish folklore and legend. She collected and recorded many stories about the Piskey folk, fairies of Cornish myth and legend. She published most of her works in this category under her better-known pen-name of Tregarthen.();Books* The Doll Who Came Alive (1973) ISBN 0-381-99683-2* Pixie Folklore & Legends  (reprinted 1995) ISBN 0-517-14903-6 * Padstows Faery Folk (Paperback) * North Cornwall Fairies and Legends (1906)* The House of the Sleeping Winds and Other Stories (1911)* The White Ring (1949)North CornwallPool is identified by some people with the lake in which, according to Arthurian legend, Sir Bedivere threw Excalibur to Lady of the Lake.(Cornish Archaeology; No 34 1995) Another legend relating to the pool concerns Jan Tregeagle.The of Bodmin has been reported many times but never identified with certainty.;BarAccording to legend, the Mermaid of Padstow created the Doom Bar as a dying curse, after being shot by a sailor. However, there are many different versions of the story and the precise details are unclear. Some versions start by stating that she used to guide ships up the estuary and others that she would visit and spy upon ships in harbour, yet more tell of how she used to sit upon a rock at Cove. She then met a man, and one fell in love with the other. One version explains that she was love sick, and tried to lure him beneath the waves, however he escaped by shooting her.()  Another version suggested the man, Tristram Bird, fell in love with her and asked her to marry him, though she refused. In his rage he shot her.( ) Another suggestion is that a fisherman, Tom Yeo, shot her because he thought she was a seal. The ending of the legend is generally similar. With her dying breath, she leveled a curse at Padstow, or at the harbour itself, stating that the harbour will be desolate or unsafe. With that, a great storm came, wrecking many boats and creating the great sand bank known as the Doom Bar.Penwiththumb|16th century Zennor mermaid bench endthumb|The lantern Parade on Tom Bawcocks EveWithin the bounds of Gulval parish lies the disused Dong mine, reputedly one of the oldest in Cornwall. Popular local legend claims that of Arimathea, a tin trader, visited the mine and brought a young Jesus to address the miners, although there is no evidence to support this ( Matthews, John (ed.) (1991) A Glastonbury Reader: Selections From the Myths, Legends and Stories of Ancient Avalon. London: HarperCollins (reissued by The Aquarian Press))()At Zennor there is a legend of the Mermaid of Zennor and at Mousehole, Bawcock is  a legendary fisherman from the village who according to legend risked his life to go out and fish and managed to come back with enough fish to feed the village until the storm was over. All the fish was put into a big pie, and the pie called pie.The Merry Maidens stone circle at Buryan: the local myth about the creation of the stones suggests that nineteen maidens were turned into stone as punishment for dancing on a Sunday. (Dans Maen translates as Stone Dance.) The pipers, two megaliths some distance north-east of the circle, are said to be the petrified remains of the musicians who played for the dancers. A more detailed story explains why the Pipers are so far from the Maidens - apparently the two pipers heard the church clock in St Buryan strike midnight, realised they were breaking the sabbath, and started to run up the hill away from the maidens who carried on dancing without accompaniment. These petrifaction legends are often associated with stone circles, and is reflected in the folk names of some of the nearby sites, for example, the Tregeseal Dancing Stones, the Nine Maidens of Boskednan, as well as the more distant Hurlers and Pipers on Bodmin Moor.See also*and the Piskies: Cornish Folk and Fairy Tales*of Cornwall*of Cornish saints*Tregeagle*Henry Paynter*of Britain*Corineus - mythical founder of Cornwall*Cormoran - the Giant and his wife of Michaels Mount*of Twrch Trwyth - the Cornish Boar of Welsh legend*Blunderbore*festivals*of Brittany - the brother nation over the sea*Mythology*Arthur & Celliwig*and Iseult - a Cornish love story*Lyonesse & Ys - the Cornish & Breton AtlantisReferencesFurther reading*Addicoat, Ian & Buswell, Geoff Mysteries of the Cornish Coast: legends, ghosts and extraordinary events from Cornwalls south-west peninsula.

James_Smith_(miner)
James (Philosopher) Smith (1 July 1827  15 June 1897)(Ronald E. Smith, Smith, James (Philosopher) (1827 - 1897), Dictionary of Biography, Vol. 6, MUP, 1976, pp 146-147. Retrieved 22 January 2010) was a politician, goldminer, explorer and discoverer of tin reserves in Tasmania, Australia including the Bischoff mine.  Smith was born at Georgetown, Diemens Land (now Tasmania), second of three children of John Smith and his wife Ann, ne Grant.( When James Smith was five years old, his father was shot dead and his mother later re-married.( Smith was educated at Launceston, and after working for some time managing a flour-mill there,  he went to the Victorian gold diggings in 1852.( Returning in 1853 Smith took up one square mile (2.6 km) of forested land at Westwood between the Forth River and Leven River.( After making this his headquarters Smith began exploring and prospecting. There was barren and mountainous country to the south of his home, and Smith had to endure many privations. He discovered gold on the Forth River, copper on the west side of the Leven River, and silver and ore at Penguin. On 4 December 1871 Smith discovered a large deposit of tin oxide near the summit of Bischoff.( His specimens when smelted yielded the first tin found in Tasmania, but it took some time for the importance of the find to be realised. In August 1872 Smith took a small party with him to the field and in 1873 several tons of ore were sent to Melbourne. In that year the mine was visited by William Ritchie, a solicitor at Launceston, and with his help the Mount Bischoff Tin-mining Company was floated with 12,000 shares of 5 each. Of these 4400 were reserved for Smith who also received 1500 in cash. One expert who visited the mine at this time pronounced it to be the richest tin-mine in the world. The company, however, had many difficulties, one being that the bush track to the coast for many months of the year was almost impassable. Eventually a tramway was constructed, the mine became extremely successful, much employment resulted, and an enormous sum was paid in dividends. In February 1878 Smith was publicly presented with a silver salver and a purse of 250 sovereigns; the Tasmanian parliament voted him a pension of 200 a year. The address which accompanied the gifts stated that as a result of his discovery commerce had developed, property had increased in value, and all classes of the community had been benefited. In 1886 he was elected to the Legislative Council but he resigned his seat in 1888. Smith, who was an excellent assayer and a close student of geology, continued his prospecting for the remainder of his life. Smith died at Launceston of heart disease on 15 June 1897 leaving a widow, three sons and three daughters.( A quiet, somewhat reserved man, benevolent and charitable, Smith was a natural explorer of much determination, who was not daunted by hardship. His work was of the greatest use to Tasmania not only for its own sake, but for the encouragement it gave to others who made further discoveries.References*Further reading*Binks, C.J.

Buyat_Bay
Buyat Bay is  small bay on the south coast of Peninsula on the north of Sulawesi island of Indonesia. Since 1996, Newmont Mining Corporation under its subsidiary company, PT Newmont Minahasa Raya, has been using the bay as the tailing (mine waste) dumping ground for its gold mining activities. In 2004, local people in the area complained several unusual health problems which further suspected Newmonts for breaching the mining waste level regulation to had contaminated the area with hazardous materials.( The Indonesian activist group on environment, WALHI, claimed that Newmont has been dumping 2,000 tonnes of mine waste into the bay daily.() A legal case between the government of Indonesia versus one of the companys top executive is still ongoing. History The bay is located at the southeast side of the northern peninsula arm of Sulawesi island, facing to the Sea.  Buyat is a small bay where local fisherman villages are located. Since 1996 until August 2004, the bay had been used as tailing area for the Mesel Gold Mine, operated by PT Newmont Minahasa Raya, 80%-owned subsidiary company of Mining Corporation.() Tailings from the gold mine are finely ground rock which gold has been recovered.A pipeline was constructed to transfer the tailings from the gold mine area to the bay extended 900 m to the sea and dumping the material at depth 82 m.( In July 2004, several organizations started a campaign accusing PT Newmont Minahasa Raya deliberately polluted Buyat Bay, which resulted in adverse health effect of the local residents. Pollution In the mid 2004, local fishing community appealed the Indonesian government for independent research to investigate the level of Newmonts mining waste to Buyat Bay. Local fishermen witnessed of sudden increase in fish deaths, unusual swelling in the fish body, the loss of young milkfish and several fish species in the bay area. They also complained for unusual health problem including unexplained skin diseases, tremors, headaches, and unusual swellings on the neck, calves, wrist, buttocks and head. The research then found several heavy metals including arsenic, antimony, mercury and manganese distributions in the area with the peak density around the tailing ground.(In November 2004, WALHI (the Indonesian NGO for environmental issues) together with several non-profit groups (the Indonesian Mining Advocacy Network, the Earth Indonesia, and the Indonesian Center for Environmental Law) compiled a more comprehensive report on Buyat Bay condition, concluding that the bay is polluted by hazardous level of arsenic and mercury, and thus highly risk to the community.() Arsenic pollution from the Buyat Bay seabed sediment samples revealed as high as 666 mg/kg arsenic level (hundred times than the ASEAN Marine Water Quality Criteria of only 50 mg/kg) and on average over 1000 g/kg mercury level (the same standard defines 400 g/kg level). Compared to natural control samples from sites not affected by mine waste dumping, the study also concluded that the arsenic and mercury levels were not natural and the only possible source comes from the Newmonts mine waste dumping. Mercury and arsenic accumulated in different living organisms in Buyat Bay including fish, consumed daily by the local people. Human health was at risk and the report recommended the fish consumption should be significantly reduced and the possibility of relocation of local people to other areas.In 1994, Newmonts Environmental Impact Assessment stated a thermocline layer at 50&ndash;70 meters depth as a barrier to keep tailings from mixing and spreading in Buyat Bay. Despite of Newmonts claim, WALHI did not find the thermocline ocean layer.( Legal Case In August 2004, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment filed a US$133.6 million civil lawsuit against Newmont, claiming tailings from the companys Minahasa Raya mine polluted Buyat Bay in the North Sulawesi province, causing nearby villagers to become seriously ill and contaminating local fish stocks. Newmont denied the allegations, arguing that the illnesses had more to do with poor hygiene and poverty. On November 15, 2005, a Jakarta court dismissed the suit on technical grounds, saying the government had breached the terms of its contract with Newmont when it took legal action before seeking arbitration. Environmentalists urged for the suit to be appealed, but on December 1, 2005, Environment Minister Witoelar said the government expected to reach an out-of-court settlement with Newmonts local subsidiary. By negotiating a settlement, we hope to be able to quickly compensate people living near the mine, he said. The government negotiating team was led by chief Economics Minister Bakrie. On February 16, 2006, the Indonesian government announced it would settle the civil suit for US$30 million to be paid over the next 10 years. The agreement also includes increased scientific monitoring and enhanced community development programs for the North Sulawesi province. Newmont, with a value of US$25 billion, is expected to make US$5 billion in revenues for 2006.Though the civil suit was dismissed, there is still pending a criminal suit against Newmonts top U.S. executive in Indonesia, Ness, on charges stemming from the same allegations. His trial began in August 2005 if convicted, Ness faces up to 10 years in prison. Prosecutors have recommended financial penalties of US$110,000 for Newmont and US$55,000 for Ness.()On April 24, 2007, Ness was cleared of all charges relating to the alleged pollution in Buyat Bay.( ) Furthermore, the Indonesian court held that Buyat Bay was not polluted and that Newmonts local subsidiary was in compliance with all environmental regulations and permits for the entirety of its operation from 1996 to 2004. Media depiction A documentary film entitled Bye Buyat was made in 2006 and it won the Indonesias top film award, Film Festival in the same year. Newmont Mining Corp. objected to the documentary saying that the film interferes with the controversial Richard Ness pollution trial.() See also * issues in Indonesia* disasters References  External links * * Buyat

George Johnston (1855-1945) was a Scottish engineer, who spent the early part of his career in engineering before designing and constructing Scotlands first automobile, the Mo-Car, which led to the formation of the Arrol-Johnston Car Company Ltd.BiographyBorn the son of the Reverend James Johnston, of Springburns Presbyterian Church, Johnston worked as a locomotive engineer for the Hyde Park Locomotive Company Limited of Springburn, Glasgow.()In 1894 Johnston was commissioned by the City of Glasgow to build an experimental steam tram-car to replace the trams. When it was having a final test before a Corporation committee it took fire and it was abandoned.Johnstons attention was then turned to a detailed examination of continental makes of motor car. He came to the conclusion that he could design and make a better vehicle than any of them and in particular a better engine. The first British-built motor car was thus conceived and by the end of 1895 was ready for financial backing. In the autumn of that year Johnston was joined by his cousin Norman Osborne Fulton and T. Blackwood Murray, former Works Manager with Mavor and Coulson, makers of mining machinery in Bridgeton.() and Johnston formed a joint venture with William Arrol, an engineer of the Forth Bridge to form the Mo-Car Syndicate Limited, which was to produce his car. Sir William was Chairman and Johnston was Managing Director, and the Syndicate included a Mr. Archibald Coats, and a Mr. Millar of Paisley, while his cousin Norman Fulton was Works Manager. Sir Williams main interest in the business was as the financial backer.  Fulton and Murray later parted company with Johnston in 1899 to set up Motors.Johnston departed the Arrol-Johnston company in 1903 after it had been restructured financially, as a result of a disagreement, to join the All British Car Company.(Notes

Jessie_Aspinall
relations               AspinallJessie Strahorn Aspinall (10 December 1880  25 August 1953) was the first female junior medical resident at the Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, Sydney. Her four brothers were also doctors.Professional careerIn 1906 Aspinall applied for residency at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPA), but her application was initially rejected by the board. Her father took up her cause and had a long letter published in the Morning Herald early in February. This drew the attention of the public and of many different groups to the rejection of Jessies application by the hospital, with one commentator concluding that: Miss Aspinall will pass into history as a noble martyr, while the men who threw her out will be bracketed with Bloody Jeffreys, Torquemada and Judas Iscariot.() Amid protests from Womens Rights Groups and intense media scrutiny, the board reversed its decision on 2 May. She practiced at RPA until June 1907, when she was appointed the junior house surgeon at the General Hospital, Hobart. In 1908 Jessie was appointed Resident Medical Officer of the Crown Street Womens Hospital, Sydney, and would progress to become Medical Superintendent of the institution. Eventually Jessie moved into private practice, and had consulting rooms at Lyons Terrace and Macquarie Street, both in central Sydney. Aspinall also served as the school doctor for Scots College.Family background and educationJessie Aspinall was born in Forbes, South Wales, the third daughter of the Rev. Arthur Aspinall and his wife Helen, the only one to survive to adulthood. Upon moving to Sydney she studied at the Ladies College, Sydney, Riviere College and Girls School before earning her Bachelor of Medicine from the of Sydney.On 22 June 1915 Aspinall married mining engineer Ambrose William Freeman, to whom she bore 4 children: two sons and two daughters. The family spent two periods living in Malaya. Jessie died of arteriosclerosis. Her ashes were interred in the family grave at the South Head Cemetery.Cultural activitiesAspinall was actively involved with the Sydney executive of the Victoria League, the Council of Women and the appeals committee of the Womens Christian Association. Jessie Aspinall will be remembered for being one of the first female doctors in general hospitals in Australia, and whose achievements challenged ingrain cultural beliefs about the position of women within society.(All this fuss about a trivial incident? women, hospitals and medical work in New South Wales, 1900-1920)ObituariesObituaries to Jessie appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald and in The Medical Journal of Australia.See also*of Australian Presbyterians*of Old Girls of PLC SydneyReferences*Andrew, Phillipa A (1997) Built To Last: the stories of John and Thomas Aspinall and their descendants.

Gosling_Creek_Reservoir
 cities  Gosling Creek Reservoir, located just to the south of New South Wales at ) was the first significant water supply reservoir for Orange, opening in 1890. Subsequently further water supply dams were built at Canobolas (then known as Meadow Creek Dam) in 1918 and then Spring Creek Reservoir in 1931.  The latest and current main dam built for water supply purposes to Orange is Park Dam which was opened in 1962. Gosling Creek Reservoir is no longer used for the Orange water supply, and in recent years Orange City Council has been developing the area as a recreation reserve.  Facilities being developed include a pedestrian and cycle way system, playground, bird hide, passive recreation areas.  The reservoir was previously surrounded by pine plantations which have been logged and progressively replaced by native vegetation plantings. In May, 2007 the nearby mine approached Orange City Council with a request to obtain water from Gosling Creek Reservoir for mining purposes due to their dwindling water supplies as a result of the ongoing drought.

Rtyn_v_Podkrkono
Rtyn v Podkrkono () is a small town in the District, the Republic. The dominating feature is a Roman Catholic church and a wooden bell tower (it is not exactly known when these were built). The very first reference about Rtyn dates back to the 14th century when it used to be one of the biggest agricultural cities in the region. The way of living changed a lot in 16th century when coal mining in this region started, although the agriculture did not lose its importance.Peasants used to keep an important position in Rtyn, which was proved by a peasant uprising in 1775. Coal mining as well as the uprising is remembered in the exposition of the town museum.Nowadays it has about 3,000 inhabitants. There is a primary school, nursery school, library and a gym accessible not only to the primary-school pupils.The town is host to an annual concert band festival which has been held annually for 47 years, most recently on May 28 and 29, 2011.  Bands from throughout the Czech Republic as well as other European countries are invited to attend.  The town is also the seat of the Koleta Miners Band, the oldest municipal band in the Czech Republic (founded in 1864) and the host band for the annual band festival.

William_Moore_(steamship_captain)
William Moore (30 March 1822  29 March 1909) was a steamship captain, businessman, miner and explorer in Columbia and Alaska. During most of British Columbias gold rushes (from the Queen Charlottes in 1852 until the Cassiar Gold Rush in 1872) Moore could be found at the center of activity, either providing transportation to the miners, working claims or delivering mail and supplies.In 1887, guided by First Nations explorer Jim (who later co-discovered the Klondike Goldfields), William Moore was guided through the Pass route that would become a famous route to the Gold Rush and purchased the land that would later become the famous gold rush town of Skagway. Throughout his 87 years, he would father four sons and three daughters and make and lose at least three separate fortunes. His friends and rivals would give him many nicknames, among them, William Buddy Moore and The Flying Dutchman.Early yearsWilliam Moore was born in Germany on 30 March 1822. By the age of seven, he was sailing on schooners on the Sea and by age 24, his adventures brought him to Orleans, Louisiana.()New Orleans and San FranciscoIn New Orleans, William Moore married Hendrika in 1846 and worked on riverboats on the River. In 1848, he served in the War aboard the USS Lawrence. That same year, he became a citizen of the States and his eldest son, John (JW), was born. In 1851, he moved his family to Francisco, but arrived too late to participate in the Gold Rush.(Queen Charlotte Islands and PeruIn 1852, William Moore and his family left San Francisco on the brig Tepic for the Charlotte Islands where gold had been discovered on Island.After a month of fruitless prospecting, the Moores returned to San Francisco. Not one to sit for long, William became intrigued by the wealth of the Incas and he packed up his wife and son and embarked to Peru, where he purchased a schooner and traded up and down the Peruvian coast. In 1854, his second son, William D. Moore (Billie), was born at Callao. However, Hendrika was frightened by the ongoing revolutions in Peru, and they returned to San Francisco in 1856. Moore purchased property on Goat Island and raised goats. Also in 1856, his third child, daughter Henrietta, was born.()British ColumbiaFraser Canyon Gold RushIn 1858, William Moore heard the news of the gold discoveries on the River in British Columbia. He immediately sold his Goat Island property, packed up his livestock (mostly goats) and family onto his schooner and embarked for Victoria, where he would build the family home and have a fourth child, son Henry. Upon his arrival, Moore built a 15 ton barge named Blue Bird. As 30,000 gold-seekers poured into what would soon be the of British Columbia, Moore made his first fortune, not in mining, but in providing transportation for the miners and delivering their supplies up the Fraser River to Fort Hope. In 1859, he replaced the cumbersome barge with a sternwheeler named the Henrietta, built by James Trahey at Victoria and launched in October. To pilot her, Moore hired Captain Deighton, also known as Gassy Jack, who would later be renowned as the first resident of Granville, which would become Vancouver.()The Henrietta navigated the Fraser River to Yale in February 1860, but Moore soon replaced her with a new and more powerful sternwheeler, the Flying Dutchman, which was launched in Victoria that September. She operated on the Lake route between Harrisonmouth (since named Harrison Mills) and Port Douglas.New Westminster soon had an opportunity to be grateful to Captain Moore, when the bitterly cold winter of 1861-62 froze the Fraser River from Island to Hope and isolated New Westminster from December until March 12, when Moore used the Flying Dutchman paddlewheel first and spent three days smashing a passage through the ice so supplies could be delivered to the little community.()Nevertheless, that spring the competition on the Fraser River resulted in rate wars between Moore and his main rival, Captain William Irving, so Moore began looking for greener pastures and soon found one on the River, which he was the first to navigate by sternwheeler.()Stikine Gold RushIn 1862, when Moore learned of the gold discovery on the Stikine River, he built another barge, the JW Moore and packed the Flying Dutchman with 60 passengers and towed the barge 300 perilous miles up the coast to Wrangell which lay at the entrance to the Stikine River. Undeterred by the Stikines reputation for being a dangerous river, Moore took the Flying Dutchman, with the JW Moore in tow, up to Bar without incident, making the  journey in only three days. Having a monopoly on the Stikine, Moore charged $100 a ton for freight, and $20 fare per man, plus a 5 cent per pound baggage fee. Meals and berths were extra. During the 1862 season, he made a profit of $20,000. He returned to Victoria that fall and met his fifth child, daughter Wilhemina.()thumb|right|300px|Moores Alexandra on the Fraser River in 1864In 1863, Moore returned the JW Moore and the Flying Dutchman to the Fraser River and, deciding to invest his Stikine fortune, ordered another sternwheeler from James Trahey, the Alexandra, which (having two funnels) was styled in the manner of Mississippi paddle steamers and would be the largest steamboat to that date on the Fraser.(Moore intended for her to run from Victoria to Yale, connecting with the Flying Dutchman on Harrison Lake, but the Alexandra proved to be too big and expensive to operate and only made a few trips on that route. Moore suffered additional financial hardship as rate wars raged between him and his rival, William Irving, driving steamer fares down to as low as 25 cents for the trip between Westminster and Yale. The rivalry involved Victoria and New Westminster as well, as Moore was from the former and Irving from the latter. The rivalry between the towns reached new heights when insults were traded in the local papers, with New Westminster saying that Victoria was built on a frogpond and Victoria retorting that New Westminster was a pimple on the face of creation.()By 1865, Moore had lost the Flying Dutchman and the Alexandra and declared bankruptcy. Moore was not out of business for long, however, and soon purchased another sloop and moved his family and their goats to New Westminster, where Hendrika had their sixth child, son Bernard.  Moore then purchased the barge Lady of the Lake, equipped it with sails and renamed it Marcella and ran it from New Westminster through Sound to Washington.()Big Bend Gold RushEarly in 1866, Moore learned of the gold discoveries at Big Bend and put in a tender for the contract to run steamer service from Savona on Lake to Seymour City (Seymour Arm) on Lake, but his rival, Captain Irving, won the contract. Moore decided to purchase another barge and ran it on that route with his eldest son, John. The Big Bend Gold Rush ended shortly afterwards, and Moore purchased land in Kamloops and his family, with their omnipresent goats, joined him there, ironically making part of the trip on Captain Irvings sternwheeler, Onward.()Cariboo Gold RushLater in that spring of 1866, Moore had already had enough of farming and moved his family up to Barkerville, where he worked as a miner until 1869, when he learned of yet another new gold discovery, this time in the Country.()Omineca Gold RushIn 1869, Moore moved his family and goats to Quesnel and built another barge. In the spring of 1870, the barge was completed and Hendrika took the youngest children to Victoria, while eldest sons John and Billie stayed behind. Billie would work for a merchant in Quesnel, while John accompanied his father on the barge. It was loaded with supplies and hauled  up north via the Fraser, Nechako, and Stuart Rivers and through Lake onto River to Lake to River, finally arriving at Lake where Landing led to the trails to the Omineca diggings.()After delivering the supplies, Moore and John began prospecting, but had no luck, and come winter, they left the barge on Takla Lake and took the Babine trail to Hazelton, canoeing down the River to the coast, where they took the steamship Otter back to Victoria.In the spring of 1871, Moore built another schooner, the Minnie, and loaded her with more supplies for the Omineca district and went up the coast, accompanied by his sons, John and Henry, a crew of thirty men, and a herd of mules. But even an experienced riverboat captain like Moore could not ascend the entire length of the perilous and swift Skeena River with a loaded barge. Facing starvation, his crew left, and Moore and his sons had to drive the mules the remaining  to Hazelton on foot. Taking the Babine trail back to Takla, they were joined by Billie, and the four Moores ran the barge and the pack mules for the Omineca miners for the rest of that season.They returned to Victoria that fall and embarked to Omenica again in the spring of 1872, with a contract from the Bay Company to freight supplies up the Skeena to Hazelton. At Essington, Moore built two more barges and two large canoes, and hired 24 First Nations men of the Haida, Tongass and Tsimpsean tribes: 12 to crew the barges and 12 more to man the canoes. William captained the first barge, John, the second, while Bille and Henry each captained a canoe. After navigating through the treacherous Kitselas Canyon, where the barges had to be pulled and pried through foot by foot, the party was met by local man Hankin, who warned them that the tribe based at the Kitsequekla Canyon, whom he called Sticks, were hostile, as their village had been accidentally burnt down by some white miners. Despite the warning, and the uneasiness of his crew of Coast natives, (who were not friendly with this particular tribe either), Moore armed everyone with muskets and proceeded to the next canyon. As they navigated up the canyon, the Sticks threatened to fight unless Moore paid for his passage, but Moore refused, explaining that the goods were not his, and that the government would pay for the losses they incurred when their village was destroyed. The Sticks clearly did not think much of Moores argument, but seeing that everyone was armed and knowing that three of their own chiefs were currently on the coast, they eventually allowed the flotilla to pass. Once they arrived in Hazelton, John took the mules up the Babine trail while Moore, Billie, Henry and their crew returned down the Skeena to pick up another load. When they were floating past the Kitsequekla Canyon, shots were fired and one of the crewmen was wounded in the leg, while another bullet barely missed Moore. One of Moores crew fired back, but most of their attention had to be kept on guiding the canoes and barges through the canyon, which they navigated without further incident. Upon their return at Port Essington, they learned that the government, having heard of burning of the Sticks village, had sent Lieutenant-Governor Trutch in a gunboat, HMS Scout. Trutch met with the chiefs and explained that the fire had been an accident and gave them $600 as compensation.()Moore made three more trips to Hazelton that summer and then he sent John up to the River with a team of pack mules, while he, Billy and Henry took the barges back to Port Essington and took the Minnie up the coast to the Nass, where they met with John again. The boys spent the winter  south of Landing in a cabin by what is now Cove. Moore himself returned to Victoria to be with his wife and daughters. But, by the next spring, Moore heard of yet another gold discovery and wrote the boys and told them to get ready to go to the Cassiar.Cassiar Gold RushIn April 1873, Moore met his three sons at Port Essington, where they loaded the Minnie and a barge up with supplies and took them  north up to Fort Wrangell and then  up the Stikine River, leaving the Minnie onshore. There they were joined by six prospectors and two First Nations guides, who all boarded the barge and with much towing, rowing and sailing, the group covered the last  to Creek. Once there, they all continued on foot, carrying their supplies in heavy backpacks through swamps and streams for 28 days until they reached the diggings on Lake. Moore and his sons continued packing supplies into the area until they came across Creek and met Thibert and his party, who were recovering 3 to 6 ounces of gold per day. Moore and his sons staked claims nearby and by September 18, they had recovered $5000 in gold. By then, there was snow on the ground and they went back to Victoria for the winter. Moore was not idle however; he convinced the government that a pack trail needed to be built between Telegraph Creek and Dease Lake. He was awarded the contract and in partnership with Victoria merchant, Lenz, built the trail and operated a mule team over it.By the fall of 1874, the Cassiar Gold Rush was in full swing, and Moore and his three sons had made an astounding $100,000 from their claims.()Moore wasted no time in investing the money and ordered a new sternwheeler, the Gertrude, which was launched at Victoria on March 22, 1875. Youngest son Bernard, (Ben), now ten, was considered old enough to join the rest of the men in the family on the northern rivers and worked on the Gertrude with his father and brother, Billie, while Henry and John worked at the placer mines.()thumb|left|300px|Moores Gertrude at Telegraph Creek 1882That fall, Moore took the Gertrude back to his old stomping grounds on the Fraser River. Although his old rival, William Irving, had died in 1872, Irvings son John, had taken over the family business, and was proving that he could admirably fill his fathers shoes.(Moore ran the Gertrude against Irvings Royal City for a few weeks, creating a rate war that would lower fares to $1 between New Westminster and Yale. Seeing there was no money to be made that way, Moore laid the Gertrude up at Victoria and turned to other matters. He purchased an old British gunboat, the Grappler, five Victoria waterfront lots and one of John Irvings sternwheelers, the Glenora, with the understanding that Irving would stay away from the Stikine River.During 1876, Moores business flourished as the Grappler took miners and supplies from Victoria up the coast to Fort Wrangell, where they met the Gertrude, which Moore piloted, and the Glenora, which Billie piloted, taking the miners and supplies up the Stikine to Telegraph Creek. However, by the end of the season, the rush was nearing its end and Moore sold his claims to a syndicate of Chinese miners and returned to Victoria.()Revisit to Fraser RiverIn 1877, Moore returned yet again to the Fraser River and ran the Gertrude against John Irvings Reliance, but in 1878 he returned to the Stikine in time to fight off more new competition there, the Nellie owned by Calbreath, the packer and storekeeper whod been responsible for bringing the infamous camels to the Cariboo in 1862. Now that there was competition in the Cassiar, his thoughts returned to the Fraser again and the idea of running against Irving on the route from New Westminster to Yale.thumb|right|300px|Moores Western Slope at YaleSo, in 1879, Moore built another new sternwheeler, the Western Slope, which was launched at Victoria on May 8.()The old rivalry ran hot as Moores and Irvings sternwheelers raced up and down the Fraser, competing for passengers. To compete with Moore, Irving built a new sternwheeler in 1881, the $80,000 Elizabeth J Irving, which on its second trip to Yale, raced Moores Western Slope and, midway through the race, caught on fire and was soon reduced to a charred wreck, resulting in the deaths of four First Nations crewmen, two horses and two cows. The loss was a tremendous blow to John Irving, who had just allowed the vessels insurance to expire a week earlier.()()thumb|left|300px|John Irvings William Irving at Yale.In 1882, Moore sold the Gertrude and built the Pacific Slope, but by the end of the year, he had fallen on hard times again and sold the Pacific Slope to Onderdonk and declared bankruptcy again, losing not only his sternwheelers, but also his home and properties in Victoria. John Irving purchased the Western Slope at auction, and being a man of great honor, hired Billie to be her captain, Henry her mate and John her purser, thus helping his rivals family remain solvent. William Moore, now 60, was hardly ready to become an employee of his old rivals 28-year-old son, so he built another sternwheeler, the Teaser, which was eventually seized by creditors (despite Billies attempt to hide her in Alaska), and sold and renamed the Rainbow.()Meanwhile, Moore built the Alaskan and took her up to the Stikine, which he now had to himself for the 1885 season of navigation. In 1886, Moore heard the call of gold again and went up to the River. Henry was to meet him there, but was tragically murdered on Vancouver Island on his schooner along with three companions. He left behind a wife and four children.()By 1887, Moore joined the government survey party headed by Ogilvie and showed them how to build and navigate a barge up the Yukon River. Once the party got to the Chilkoot Pass, Moore heard tales of another route to the Yukon and, with Skookum Jim, started up the River and went over the  long pass, meeting up with the Oglivie party at Lake. When Oglivie heard of this new route, he named it White Pass, after Thomas White, the of the Interior.Moore then told Ogilvie of his belief that the Yukon Valley would be the site of the next gold rush and that the White Pass would be a major route to it.()AlaskaBy the fall of 1887, after traveling through the White Pass to Lake Bennett, Moore somehow knew that gold would soon be discovered in the Yukon and wasted no time in preparing for the day his prediction would come to pass. With his son, Ben, Moore struck out for Alaska by canoe. When they passed what would later be named Skagway, Moore noted that it would be a good place for a wharf. Loading up with supplies in Juneau, they swiftly returned through the Canal to Skagway Bay where Moore preempted  at the mouth of the Skagway River at a place the Indians called Skagua, and named it Mooresville. He built a log cabin, a sawmill, and began the construction of a wharf in anticipation of the ships that would land there, offloading thousands of eager gold-seekers.()He and Ben returned to Victoria in that winter where Moore wrote several letters to Ottawa, telling of the Yukons great potential and the need for a wagon road over the White Pass. His letters were ignored. Undaunted, as always, Moore returned to his property every summer and freighted through the Lynn Canal with his new sternwheeler, another Flying Dutchman. In 1891, he asked the States Secretary of the Interior for a contract to build a road through the White Pass, and again, his request was ignored.()In 1896, when Moore was 74, he won the mail contract to deliver the mail on the  long route from Juneau to Mile, Yukon.On one mail trip he met Carmack, who had just staked a claim on a small creek named Rabbit Creek, soon to be Creek, just off of the River. Moores prediction was about to come true.()Klondike Gold RushOn July 29, 1897, the mail steamer Queen would be the first of the gold rush flotilla to dock at Moores wharf in Skagway Bay, followed by John Irvings Islander and the collier Willamette. Alaska was born and became a boomtown overnight.() Originally the Indians called it Skagua, Moore renamed it Mooresville and the stampeders took over and named it Skaguay, later spelled Skagway. What Moore did not anticipate was the lack of concern for his legal rights in ownership of the land Skagway sat upon. The residents and stampeders that made up the population pushed Moore aside and took over ownership of his land. When streets were surveyed it was found that Moores home stood directly in its path. Moore put up a fight but in the end his home was uprooted and moved to another location. Moore brought suit against the claim jumpers who remained in town after the rush and, in 1901, won a 25% reimbursement.In 1900, Moore would make one final prospecting trip, this time to Alaska, however, he soon returned to Skagway and built a house on Skagway Bay. On top of the house he built a room fashioned in the style of a pilot-house where he could look out at the ships in the bay. He died nine years later, in Victoria on 29 March 1909 at the venerable age of 87.()NotesReferences* Captain William Moore BCs Amazing Frontiersman Norman Hacking ISBN 1-895811-02-3* Paddlewheels on the Frontier Volume One Art Downs ISBN 0888260334* Pioneer Goldseekers of the Omineca Ralph Hall ISBN 1-55039-046-5External links* Biography at Samson V Maritime Museum

Terre_Haute,_Indianapolis_and_Eastern_Traction_Company
File:Terminal Arcade.JPG|thumb|THI&E Arcade in Haute, IndianaThe Terre Haute, Indianapolis and Eastern Traction Company, or THI&E, was the second largest interurban in the state of Indiana at the height of the interurban era.  This system included over 400 miles of track, with lines emanating from Indianapolis to the east, northwest, west and southwest as well as streetcar lines in several major cities.  The THI&E was formed in 1907 by the Syndicate as a combination of several predecessor companies, and operated independently until incorporation into the Railroad in 1931.  The THI&E served a wide range of territory, including farmlands in central Indiana, the mining region around Brazil, and numerous urban centers.  Eventually it succumbed, like all of the other central Indiana interurban lines, to competition from automobiles and trucks and improved paralleling highways.12ConsolidationOn March 1, 1907, financiers Hugh J. McGowan, Randal Morgan and W. Kesley Schoepf formed the THI&E out of four predecessor companies: the Indianapolis and Western Railway, which operated the line from Indianapolis west to Danville; the Indianapolis and Eastern Railway, with lines from Indianapolis east to Dublin and from Dunreith to New Castle;  the Richmond Street and Interurban Railway, with the line in eastern Indiana from Dublin to Richmond; and the Indianapolis Coal Traction Company.  Three weeks later the THI&E acquired the Terre Haute Traction and Light Company, which operated a line from Terre Haute south to Sullivan, north to Clinton, Indiana, and west to Paris, Illinois.  In April 1907 the Schoepf-McGowan Syndicate leased the Indianapolis and Northwestern Traction Company, a system of over 90 miles with lines from Indianapolis to Lafayette and from Lebanon to Crawfordsville, and purchased the Indianapolis and Martinsville Rapid Transit Company, which ran between the cities in its name.  The final major piece of the THI&E was the 1912 addition of the Indianapolis Crawfordsville and Danville Electric Railway, nicknamed the Ben Hur Route in honor of Wallace of Crawfordsville, author of the novel Ben Hur.OperationsThe THI&E was a very typical Midwestern interurban line, operating far-flung lines out of Indianapolis to midsized prairie cities using long wooden combines.  Trackage quality varied, with some hill and dale side-of-road operation contrasting with fairly major earthworks in hillier sections of the line. Main lines had color light block signals. Most passenger service was hourly, and main routes also saw some express service.  The express to Terre Haute was named the Highlander. The Ben Hur Special ran to Crawfordsville, and the Tecumseh Arrow ran to Lafayette. The THI&E was never prosperous enough in the 1920s to replace its aging fleet of wood interurban cars but many were rebuilt and modernized, and much of the town streetcar line system was reequipped with one-man Birney streetcars. When Indiana Railroad absorbed THI&E, both its trackage, freight facilities, and equipment were improved or replaced by IR. THI&Es large wood passenger combines (passenger+freight in one car) with their prominent cow catchers were retired or converted to freight box motors. 1 The IRs former THI&E line eastward to Richmond connected to the Dayton and Western/Ohio interurbans and was important trackage for IRs critical freight business.2Decline and AbsorptionThe THI&E was perhaps the weakest of the great Indiana interurban systems During the 1920s its consistent operating deficits were offset only by the sale of power from its stations and by the profits of the Street Railway, a subsidiary company.  The company went into receivership on April 2, 1930.  At this time Insulls Midland Utilities was in the process of consolidating most of the major Indiana interurbans (Indiana Service Corporation/ISC, Union Traction, Interstate/IPS, THI&E) into the Indiana Railroad, but the unprofitable lines that made up much of the THI&E didnt fit into his master plan. The long west-east Terra Haute-Indianaopolis-Richmond line did, but the Danville, Martinsville, Lafayette and Crawfordsville branches were abandoned on October 31, 1930. The lines to Sullivan and Clinton were abandoned early the next year. In June 1931, the THI&E was acquired by Utilities and was incorporated into the Indiana Railroad. The last former THI&E line was abandoned in 1940, and the Indiana Railroad abandoned all operations in 1941.2References*1. Middleton. p 241. Creation of Indiana Railroad which included THI&E lines.

Ecosystem_restoration
Ecosystem restoration is the return of a damaged ecological system to a stable, healthy, and sustainable state, often together with associated services()RationaleThere are many reasons to restore ecosystems.  Some include:*Restoring capital (i.e. goods and services)*Mitigating change (e.g. through sequestration)*Helping threatened or species*Aesthetic reasons (Harris et al. 2006, Macdonald et al. 2002)*Moral reasons: we have degraded, and in some cases destroyed, many ecosystems so it falls on us to fix them.There is also the dissenting opinion that ecosystem restoration is not a valuable use of our time.  Reasons for this opinion can include:*Restorations may not be economically feasible*They dont always work*They may be expensive (money could be put to better uses)*Ecosystems naturally change over time and may recover by themselvesThe problem is that we cannot restore an ecosystem to exactly the same state it was in before we disturbed it.  This is because, as Anthony Bradshaw claims, ecosystems are not static, but in a state of dynamic equilibrium. restoration we aim a moving target.  Even though an ecosystem may not be in its original state, the functions of the ecosystem (especially ones that provide services to us) may be more valuable than its configuration (Bradshaw 1987).  One reason to consider ecosystem restoration is to mitigate climate change through activities such as afforestation.  Afforestation involves replanting forests, which remove carbon dioxide from the air.  dioxide is a leading cause of warming (Speth, 2005) and capturing it would help alleviate climate change. Problems with restoration Many people take the view that ecosystem restoration is impractical.  One reason for this view is that restoration of ecosystems does not always work.  There are many reasons for restoration failure.  Hilderbrand et al. (2005) point out that many times uncertainty (about ecosystem functions, species relationships, and such) is not addressed, and that the time-scales set out for complete restoration are unreasonably short.  Other times an ecosystem may be so degraded that abandonment (allowing an injured ecosystem to recover on its own) may be the wisest option (Holl, 2006).  Other negative impacts of ecosystem restoration can include the introduction of large predators, which may inspire doubts in peoples safety, and plants, some requiring regimes such as regular fires (MacDonald et al. 2002).  High economic costs can also be a perceived as a negative impact of the restoration process.  Public opinion is very important in the feasibility of a restoration; if the public believes that the costs of restoration outweigh the benefits, then support for that project is unlikely to be big, especially in small towns (MacDonald et al. 2002).  In these cases people might be ready to follow the abandonment route and let the ecosystem recover on its own, which can sometimes occur relatively quickly (Holl, 2006).Many failures have occurred in past restoration projects, many times because clear goals were not set out as the aim of the restoration. This may be because, as Peter Alpert says, people may not always know how to manage natural systems effectively.  Also many assumptions are made about myths of restoration such as the copy, where a restoration plan, which worked in one area, is applied to another with the same results expected, but not realized (Hilderbrand et al. 2005).

Okiep
footnotes               thumb|Ventilation shaft built by the Cape Copper Company in 1880 Okiep is a small town in the Cape province of Africa, and was in the 1870s ranked as having the richest copper mine in the world. The town is on the site of a spring that was known to the people as U-gieb (brackish spring), hence the name Okiep.HistoryEarly settlers in the Colony heard rumours of mountains in the north-west that were fabulously rich in copper. Governor van der Stel was inclined to believe these tales when, in 1681, a group of Namas visited the Castle in Town and brought along some pure copper. Van der Stel himself led a major expedition in 1685 and reached the fabled mountains on 21 October. Three shafts were sunk and revealed a rich lode of copper ore - the shafts exist to this day. For almost 200 years nothing was done about the discovery, largely because of its remote location. The explorer James Alexander was the first to follow up on van der Stels discovery. In 1852 he examined the old shafts, discovered some other copper outcrops and started mining operations. Prospectors, miners and speculators rushed to the area, but many companies collapsed when the logistical difficulties became apparent.The first miners were Cornish, and brought with them the expertise of centuries of tin-mining in Cornwall. The ruins of the buildings they constructed as well as the stonework of the bridges and culverts of the railway built to transport the ore to Nolloth, can still be seen. This narrow-gauge railway started operating in 1876 and lasted for 68 years, carrying ore to Port Nolloth and returning with equipment and provisions. The carriages were initially pulled by mules and horses, which were later replaced by steam locomotives - the last of these, the Clara, stands at Nababeep. Nowadays road transport is used to convey the ore to the railhead at Bitterfontein. The other principal mines of the area are at Carolusberg and Nababeep. Okieps mine saw action on 4 April 1902 during the war when some 700 officers and men of the 3rd Battalion Queens Royal Regiment, 5th Warwickshire Regiment, Namaqualand Border Scouts, the Town Guard and the Garrison Artillery, withstood a 30-day siege by Smuts forces. The village of Concordia with a garrison of 100 men, surrendered a day after the siege started. On 4 May 1902 a British relief column arrived from Port Nolloth and ended the siege. A ruined blockhouse is still visible on a hill north-east of the town.thumb|The Cape Copper Company medal awarded to the defenders of OkiepAs with most metals copper suffered mixed fortunes, and in the early 20th century the copper price dropped below the profitable level, so that mining operations ceased, but were resumed when prices rose.af:Okiepde:Okiepnl:Okiepro:Okiep

Sioux_Narrows-Nestor_Falls
 footnotes            Sioux Narrows-Nestor Falls is a township in the Canadian province of Ontario, located in the District. It is located on the eastern shores of of the Woods along Highway 71.The township was formed in 2001 by amalgamating the formerly incorporated Township of Sioux Narrows with portions of Unorganized Kenora District, including the community of Nestor Falls. The township had a population of 672 in the 2006 Census.CommunitiesSioux Narrows is a small resort community located on the shores of of the Woods where Highway 71 crosses the eponymous narrows to Regina Bay. There are about 300 permanent residents, and about double that in the summer time when cottagers from Ontario, Manitoba, and the States come for vacation. Tourism is the primary industry, with many resorts in the nearby vicinity.In the mid-18th century, an Ojibwa-Cree alliance is said to have defeated an invading party of Sioux at a narrows here on the lake. Sioux Narrows is named in recognition of that event. The Narrows Bridge, a historic structure on Highway 71 which was reconstructed in 2007, overlooks the site of the battle.()Nestor Falls, located along Highway 71 at Sabaskong Bay on Lake of the Woods, held the status of place in the 2006 Census, and has a population of 290. The settlement was founded in the early 20th century by a certain Mr. Nestor who started logging operations and used the natural waterfall there to transport the logs to Lake of the Woods.(HistoryThe area was originally home to Ojibway and Cree indigenous people. In the 18th century, of the Woods began to be exploited by European fur traders as a good source for fur and it became part of an established trade route from the Rainy River to Rat Portage. The main trading posts were set up at Rainy River and Frances, but circa 1804, an outpost was also established on Whitefish Lake (now known as Regina Bay, directly east of Sioux Narrows) by the Company.()In the 1820s, the area was surveyed in order to determine the international border between the United States and British North America. But further development was limited since the Ojibway restricted European travelers only to the regular trade routes. In 1873, the Dominion of Canada signed 3, in which the Ojibway ceded vast tracts of territory to the Government of Canada. This permitted the first wave of settlers to arrive in the late 1870s or early 1880s. The construction of the Pacific Railway in 1881 further accelerated exploration, settlement, logging, and mining. The outpost on Whitefish Lake, since 1821 owned by the Bay Company, was taken over by a private entrepeneur in the 1890s and operated until 1932.()In 1895, a gold mine opened on Regina Bay, employing about eighty-five men and led to the formation of a settlement with a schoolhouse, miners residences and a community hall. The mine was fully operational only until 1900 and thereafter operated intermittently. During that period until 1935, settlement remained sporadic and isolated, heavily dependant on the cyclical presence of mining and logging camps, and only accessible by boat or winter roads. The construction of what is now known as Highway 71 in the 1930s resulted in permanent communities and opened the area to a booming outdoor tourism industry.(DemographicsPopulation trend:(Statistics Canada: 1996, 2001, 2006 census)* Population in 2006: 672* Population in 2001: 577* Population total in 1996: 794** Sioux Narrows (township): 430* Population in 1991:** Sioux Narrows (township): 390ReferencesExternal links* Township of Sioux Narrows-Nestor Falls

Calico_Print
The Calico Print was a newspaper, established in 1882 and published during the heyday of the silver mining camp of California prior to 1902. The Calico Print was also the name of a monthly, later bi-monthly, periodical of the mid-20th century.Revival history1930sThe Calico Print  revival was established by Fuller and Coke in the 1930s as a monthly tabloid, reprinting articles from the original newspaper as well as original material.  It was sold primarily for visitors to Knotts rebuilt Ghost Town.1950sWith the November, 1950, issue of Calico Print, Harold and Lucile Weight, former staff editors at Magazine, became the principal editors. They produced 17 monthly issues in the tabloid form.  But the Weights had slipped back into the same deadline-driven routine that drove them from Desert Magazine, forcing them to neglect their efforts to record the stories and history of rapidly disappearing desert pioneers.To cope with that, periodicity of Calico Print was changed to one every two months and the format was changed to that of a slick illustrated size magazine. Nine issues of Calico Print in magazine form were issued from June 1952 through November 1953 by the Weights Press in Palms, California.  These nine issues, packed with detailed desert history, are now highly prized by desert enthusiasts.  In addition to articles authored by the Weights, there are contributions from other noted writers -- Adelaide Arnold, Burr Belden, Ed Rochester, Edmund C. Jaeger, Jerry Laudermilk, F. Lummis, Arthur Woodward, Senator Charles Brown, Oliver, Ruth Kirk, and more.In the nine-issue run of Calico Print, in its magazine format, a so-called Folio section is included in several of the issues.  Of special interest among these Folios is the one devoted to an exhaustive study of Wm. B. Rood, of Death Valley pioneer fame, published in the Aug-Sept 1952.  Other such Folios covered the Lode (June 1952); Nevada (Oct-Nov 1952); California (January 1953); The Great Survey (March 1953); the Kofa Mountains and King Mine of Arizona (May 1953); Almaden, Californias Oldest Mine (July 1953); and the legends of the Ship of the Desert (November 1953).The Calico Print was discontinued at the end of 1953, and the Weights concentrated on their occasional Panomama series of books on desert history.See also*Epitaph*Rat Scrap Book*Monthly*Ship of the Desert*TownReference book* An Introductory Note to Harold and Lucile Weights CALICO PRINT - by Dennis G.

Oakdale,_Caerphilly
Oakdale is a large village in county borough, Wales, 9 miles north of Caerphilly itself, within the historic boundaries of Monmouthshire. Situated in the Sirhowy valley it is  east of Blackwood, with which it forms a conurbation.HistoryImage:OakdaleWorkmensInstitute.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Oakdale Workmens Institute at Fagans National History MuseumIn the early years of the twentieth century the need for coal was growing both in America and Europe, and local business men in Wales were looking for new opportunities to fill the demand.(Ralph Thomas, Oakdale, The Model Village 2004 ISBN 0-9547-320-0-6)Among these were a group known as the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company, made up of wealthy industrialists from the Maclaren, Markham, Pochin, Whitworth and Wyllie families. They decided to create a group of collieries in the Sirhowy Valley, which explorations had told them contained rich seams of  black gold. One of these was at the small rural hamlet of Rhiw Syr Dafydd.Work began clearing the site for the new colliery at Oakdale with the sinking of the pit in 1907. Waterloo shaft followed in 1911 and the building of the village commenced soon after, to house the families of the men who were to work there.The revolutionary model village was the brainchild of the manager of the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company, Mr A S Tallis. This village, in contrast to others in the area, was to be built away from the mine among green fields. The houses would be modern, with hot and cold running water, large cooking ranges, electric light, and - perhaps most revolutionary of all - bathrooms. Every house was to have a front and back garden, so that no front door would open directly on to the street as in other valley towns and villages.These ideas were in themselves original enough. But the concentric design of the village that was conceived by Mr Tallis brother-in-law, Mr F R Webb, was even more radical. It was laid down with a central road (Central Avenue) and transverse roads conforming to a horseshoe shape, with linking spoke roads, making any road in the village easily accessible from any other.It has been described by John Newman as by far the most ambitious attempt by any mining company in south Wales to provide planned housing for its workforce. (Davies, John; Jenkins, Nigel (2008). The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press. ISBN 9780708319536.)The build commenced with housing, but later included schools, chapels, a hospital, a miners institute and a cinema (the Picture House).Opened in 1911, the colliery was owned by the Oakdale Navigation Collieries Ltd, a subsidiary of the Tredegar Iron Company. It employed a workforce of 2,235 at its peak in 1938. In 1920 the village received a visit from Albert, Duke of York (later to become George VI) in his capacity of President of the Industrial Welfare Society. York Avenue, in the centre of the village, is so named to commemorate the visit.Oakdale colliery was linked to Markham and the Celynen North collieries in the late 1970s and early 1980s, making it the largest colliery in Gwent. The pit closed in 1989 and the tips have now been landscaped and converted into platforms for industrial development.The Oakdale Workmens Institute was considered to be such a fine example of its type that after the closure of the colliery it was demolished brick by brick, transported to, and re-erected at, Fagans National History Museum in Cardiff.(http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/395/ Oakdale Workmens Institute)Modern Oakdalethumb|left|150px|Chartist Bridge Oakdale Business Park, a  site on the former location of Oakdale Colliery has taken 6 years and over 10 million to reclaim, creating one of the largest plateau in the South Wales Valleys of . It has already attracted world-famous business names such as Dynamics, which has based its European Headquarters there. Access to the area has been made considerably easier by the construction of the Sirhowy Enterprise Way, which includes the striking, cross-valley, Chartist Bridge.                                                                       With the rapidly expanding workforce has come the need for houses and the village has seen an explosion of building in the past few years, including a new Primary school, and the former primary school at Rhiw Syr Dafydd has become a Welsh medium school called Ysgol Gymraeg Cwm Derwen.thumb|right|150px|Bowling Green The Oakdale and Penmaen Partnership (TOPPS), set up in 2004, is a group of voluntary members made up from the local community. It brings together representatives from the local statutory, voluntary, community and private sectors to address local problems, allocate funding, discuss strategies and initiatives. They aim to encourage joint working, and community involvement and prevent silo working (i.e different agencies that share aims working in isolation) with the general aim of ensuring resources are better allocated at a local level. They also act as a middle ground between the local community and Caerphilly Council.DemographicsAccording to the Kingdom Census 2001 the population of the Penmaen ward (which comprises Oakdale and the peripheral hamlets of Pen-y-Fan and Woodfieldside) was 4,478, of which 2,144 were Males and 2,334 Females.Of these 99.7% are identified as White, 51.9% are Married, 7.9% Re-married, 6.83% Divorced, 8.3% Widowed and 23.6% Single.

Abraham_Lincoln_DeMond
Reverend Abraham Lincoln DeMond (born 1867, New York) was an advocate for American emancipation. He wrote the famous oration The Negro Element in American Life which is his only known publication. DeMond was a well-recognized African American minister in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He was the first black graduate of the State School at New York, and later studied theology at University. DeMond served as a pastor in Payne, Alabama, Avenue Baptist Church in Alabama, Plymouth Congregational Church of South Carolina, the First Congregational Church of Iowa, and the First Congregational Church of Orleans.Early lifeDeMond was the son of Quam and Phebe Darrow DeMond. He graduated from Howard University Seminary and was assigned to pastorates in New Orleans, Charleston, Montgomery and Memphis, Tennessee. He married Lula Watkins Patterson, a University graduate and music teacher. They had four children, Al DeMond, Albert DeMond, Ruth DeMond Brooks, and Marguerite DeMond Davis.Pastoral lifeThe Negro Element in American Life was A. L. DeMonds most important contribution to history. He delivered his oration to members of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama, on January 1, 1900. The Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, where DeMond gave this speech, later became known as the church from which Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement. It is today a Historic Landmark. The Emancipation Proclamation Association that published the speech was one of several so-named African American social and beneficent organizations in the US South. William Watkins, who offered the resolution to publish the speech, was a contractor and lay leader of the congregation responsible for building much of the church.Given on the first day of the twentieth century, the speech reviews African American history as a map for the American nations future. DeMonds intense national patriotism colors the texts sentiments and history. He identifies the Declaration of Independence and the Proclamation as the twin pillars of the American Republic, the latter constituting fulfillment of the former. (3) DeMond argues that the Emancipation Proclamation enabled African Americans to join in loyal patriotism, and he lauds the participation of black soldiers in the War. (4) He pays tribute to such antislavery figures as Douglass, Garnet, Garrison, Phillips, Beecher, Stowe, Whittier, Lowell, Longfellow, and Sumner for voicing a desire for freedom that informed the re-fashioning of the United States. (8) According to DeMond, American history is informed by three basic characters: the Cavalier, the Puritan and the Negro. (9) Much of the rest of the text is constituted of panegyrics to the role of African Americans in contributing all that is noblest and best in American life. (22) The tone of the speech is heavily patriotic and illustrates a rhetorical incorporation of the antislavery movement into early twentieth-century nationalist discourse on freedom and the destiny of the United States.   The first of January was a day of celebration for African-Americans who commemorated the day that President Lincolns Emancipation Proclamation went into effect. The Emancipation Proclamation Association resolved that this address by the Reverend A. L. DeMond be published in pamphlet form. DeMond emphasizes that African-Americans are fully American, not African, and therefore fully deserving of all the rights of citizens. DeMond describes the Declaration of Independence and the Emancipation Proclamation as:two great patriotic, wise and humane state papersBoth were born in days of doubt and darkness. Both were the outcome of injustice overleaping the bounds of right and reason. The one was essential to the fulfilling of the other. Without the Declaration of Independence the nation could not have been born; without the Emancipation Proclamation it could not have lived.Buxton, IowaReverend Demond was a minister in Iowa in the early 1900s. It was an unusual community that existed in Americas heartland. Originally established by the Consolidation Coal Company, Buxton was the largest unincorporated coal-mining community in Iowa. What made Buxton unique, however, is the fact that the majority of its five thousand residents were African Americans-a highly unusual racial composition for a state which was over 90 percent white. At a time when both southern and northern blacks were disadvantaged and oppressed, blacks in Buxton enjoyed true racial integration-steady employment, above-average wages decent housing, and minimal discrimination. For such reasons, Buxton was commonly known as the black mans utopia in Iowa.ReferencesLibrary of Congress American MemoryThe Negro Element in American Life,an oration delivered by Rev. A.L.

Frank_Swannell
thumb|right|300px|Frank Swannell 1910Frank Cyril Swannell (May 16, 1880 in Hamilton, Ontario - 1969 in Victoria) was one of Columbias most famous surveyors.()He came to British Columbia during the era of the Gold Rush and became a surveyors assistant. Then, from 1908, he was a professional surveyor and surveyed many regions of British Columbia. He kept a journal of his work and collected over 5000 unique pictures of the era, which were donated to BC Archives for the benefit of future researchers. The photographs span a period of more than 40 years and cover many areas of the province. Their subjects include stagecoaches, sternwheelers, old forts and remote villages, mountains and rivers, pioneer settlers, miners and Nations people. Swannells pictures are a priceless contribution to the history of British Columbia.()Early yearsSwannell graduated from high school in Toronto and then attended a two year program in mining engineering at the of Toronto from 1897-1899. In the summer of 1898, he worked for a surveying firm in Denver, British Columbia. After he graduated, he intended to travel to the Yukon to participate in the Klondike Gold Rush, but instead obtained work with the Victoria surveyors, Gore and McGregor, receiving his Provincial Land Surveying licence and Dominion Land Surveying licence in 1903 and 1904 respectively. In 1908, Swannell left the firm and struck out on his own and sooned gained a reputation for being among the best in the business.()1908-1914thumb|left|250px|Frank Swannell at Takla LakeThe construction of the Trunk Pacific Railway caused a great deal of interest in Central and Northern British Columbia, and settlers were arriving looking for agricultural land, which needed to be surveyed before it could be sold or pre-empted. The equipment the surveyors used would be considered simple by todays standards, but it was remarkably accurate: a transit and a 66 foot length of chain (80 lengths to a mile). The pioneer surveyors did more than survey land, they also recorded the topography, soil conditions and potential uses of the land, information that was a necessity for the government and land-seekers alike.()thumb|right|250px|Charlotte on the Fraser River (1908)In 1908, Swannell received the government contract to survey the Nechako Valley. Swannell and his crew worked in the summers and he kept his winter home in Victoria.When spring came, they would travel from Vancouver on the Pacific Railway to Ashcroft and take a stagecoach to Soda Creek where the sternwheeler Charlotte would take them to Quesnel. From Quesnel it was ten day hike along the Telegraph Trail to the Nechako Valley. thumb|left|250px|The surveyors camp at Stoney Creek (1908)Surveying British Columbia into the familiar 640 acre sections that are created by north to south range lines and east to west township lines was much more difficult than it was in many other areas of Western Canada. Survey lines had to be cut through dense wilderness, across swamps, lakes, rivers and over mountainous areas. Aside from surveying, Swannell also had to worry about keeping food supplies on hand for his crew, a problem which was quite often nearly insurmountable as there were few farms in the region and goods often took three weeks or longer to arrive from Bay Company stores on pack trains or by canoe.During that first summer, Swannell and his crew surveyed the area around Fraser, Lake and  Stoney Creek.Swannell with Father Coccola.gif|thumb|right|250px|Frank Swannell with Father Coccola and the Chief from Fort George (1909)In 1909, Swannell and his crew began the season by surveying lots in the Lillooet and Pemberton areas and several locations around Anderson and Seton Lakes. By July, they were finished and returned to Quesnel, transferring from the Charlotte to the new sternwheeler, Nechacco which was able to take the crew up the Fraser to Fort George and onto the River all the way to Fraser Lake. In August, Swannell traveled to St. James and inspected the surrounding area, including Lake and Lake. From there, Swannell traveled to Moricetown, Hazelton and Prince Rupert, taking many pictures of the pioneer communities and First Nations villages along the way before returning to his home in Victoria that November.thumb|left|150px|Franks crew on the Chilco near Isle Pierre (1910)In 1910, Swannell spent January and February working close to his home in Victoria, working on Island. In March, he went to the Gordon River from Renfrew and in mid March continued on to more surveying at Atla Lake in the Whistler region. By early April Swannell had moved on to the River. By July, he and his crew had returned to the Nechako Valley and surveyed the areas around Fraser Lake and the Nechako River and the Endako Valley. That year, Swannell left Endako in December, taking a 400 mile sleigh ride to Ashcroft to meet the CPR. He arrived home on New Years Eve.()thumb|right|250px|Frank Swannell and crew on a BC Express stage (1911)In 1911, he completed some small government surveys around Victoria, as well as some surveing work for private interests. By March, he was back in the Lillooet region and returned to the Nechako Valley in mid May. Travel had already become more convenient in the years since they had begun work in the region and Swannell and his party took a BC Express Company stagecoach from Ashcroft to Soda Creek, where they boarded the BC Express Companys sternwheeler, BX. By the end of May, they arrived back in the Nechako region aboard the Fort Fraser and recommenced their surveying work in the area around Fort St. James.()thumb|left|200px|Frank Swannell at 105 Mile House (November 1912)In 1912, Swannell won a large contract to survey the area around Nation Lake and throughout the surrounding Country. He and his crew would travel a total of 1,700 miles that season, most of it by raft, but some of them by a relative newcomer to the route into Northern British Columbia, the automobile.()Image:Swannells pack train at the Omineca Mountains.gif|thumb|right|250px|Swannells train near the Omineca Mountains (1913)In 1913, the General, impressed with Swannells progress in the Nechako and Omineca regions, sent him back to the area, with the intention of extending his surveys further north and east, further into the Omineca. Swannell resurveyed Pope and Takla Lake and then surveyed the area around Fort Babine, River and the River and the River. Swannells party travelled on the Mounted Police Trail that ran between Grahame and Bear Lake. On November 1, they travelled to Burns Lake from Fort St. James, and Swannell observed and photographed the ongoing construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, before travelling on to Prince Rupert and returning to Victoria.()Swannell at Fort McLeod.gif|thumb|left|250px|Frank Swannell at Fort McLeod (1914)In 1914, Swannell and his crew returned to the Omineca region and recommenced the survey work around the Finlay River. Swannell decided to take a new route home that fall and traveled up the Peace River to Hudsons Hope and Fort St. John, eventually arriving at Slave Lake where they took the steamer Northland Sun to Alberta and then they drove to the train which took them to Edmonton and then continued home by rail.()The Great WarLate in 1914, Swannell enlisted to fight in War I and in 1919, joined an anti-Bolshevik force in Siberia where he was wounded in the shoulder.Bedaux ExpeditionImage:Bedaux Expedition Citroen.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Bedaux Expedition Citroen half-track 1934Swannell was sent by the Canadian government to map the route of the ill-conceived Expedition of 1934. The expedition was intended to run 2,400 kilometers from Edmonton, Alberta to Creek, British Columbia and was led by American, Bedaux, who was acquainted with car manufacturer, Citroen, who designed the track equipped half-track trucks Bedaux used on his journey. Aside from Beduax and Swannell were fellow mapmaker, Lemarque, three women: Bedauxs wife, an Italian countess, and a maid, several cameramen, a group of cowboys from Alberta, and the man who would direct the film Noon, filmmaker, Crosby. Of the five Citroens, two slid off of cliffs, one was sent downriver and the last two were abandoned. The expedition continued on horseback, but in late September, with winter fast approaching and the horses beginning to die of disease and starvation, Bedaux called a halt to the trip just short of their destination.()Later yearsSwannell died in Victoria in 1969.Places named after Swannell* Ranges()()* Swannell River()* Mount Swannell()See also* Frank Swannell photographsFurther reading*NotesExternal links* ******

Tere_Mere_Sapne_(1971_film)
Tere Mere Sapne is a 1971 film produced by Anand, and written and directed by his brother Vijay Anand for Navketan Films. The movie stars Dev, Vijay, Mumtaz, and Malini. The films music is by D. Burman, and the story is based on The Citadel, a novel by Cronin.  In 1972 it was made as Bengali film Jiban Saikate with Chatterjee and Sen and in 1982, it was remade into the Telugu film Swapnam.()PlotDr. Anand Kumar attains his degree in medicine and re-locates to a small coal mining village to assist the local doctors there. Upon arrival, he is met by the ailing Dr. Prasad and his wife, and hired on a salary of Rs.250/- per month. He meets with the other doctors, namely Dr. Kothari, an alcoholic, and Dr. Bhutani, a dentist. Anand finds that he is saddled with all of Kotharis work as well his own because Kothari is drunk every night. He nevertheless carries on, aided by the local school-teacher, Nisha Patel, who he eventually marries. One day a proud father, Phoolchand, gives a baksheesh to Anand for the safe delivery of his first-born. This does not wager well with Mrs. Prasad, so she fires Anand. Anand and Nisha re-locate to Bombay, where Anand later establishes himself as a leading doctor, is honored for his thesis, and becomes the personal doctor of a leading Bollywood actress, Maltimala. When Dr. Kothari and Dr. Bhutani go to visit them, they find that while Nisha is still the same good-natured woman, who is now expecting a child, Dr. Anand is a changed individual.  The doctor has no time for friends, a personal life, or even his wife, and is sadly unaware that she is even pregnant. The two doctors return home disappointed, followed by Nisha, who has decided to separate from Anand. Now alone, Anand has much time on his hands to decide if he can divorce Nisha in order to marry the most sought-after actress in India.Cast*Anand as  Dr. Anand Kumar *Mumtaz as  Nisha Patel / Nisha Kumar*Kaul as  Dr. Prasad Kaul*Vijay Anand as  Dr. Jagannath Kothari *Malini as  Maltimala LocationsMost of shooting of this film was done in the coal mines area of District, Pradesh, including Parasia.SoundtrackThe Soundtrack of the movie is by Dev Burman and the lyrics were penned by Neeraj.ReferencesExternal links* *YouTube video of song, Hey Maine Kasam Li*YouTube video of song, Jeevan Ki Bagiya*Images from film

Treaty_of_Establishment,_Commerce_and_Navigation
The Treaty of Establishment, Commerce and Navigation (or the Treaty of Establishment, Commerce and Navigation with Full Protocols and Annex) was signed on August 25, 1935 between representatives of Iran and the Union. This accord helped to reinforce the tenets of the Russo-Persian Treaty of Friendship. Based on the terms of the treaty, both signatories reinforced their respective rights to fly their national flags on their respective commercial vessels. Moreover, both signatories were allowed to fish in the Sea within ten nautical miles (19 km) of the coastline.(Mehdiyoun, p. 180. The legal regime regarding the Caspian remained unchanged until after the Russian Revolution of 1917. The 1921 Treaty of Friendship between Iran and Russia abrogated all prior treaties and restored Iranian shipping rights in the Caspian. Under the Treaty of Establishment, Commerce and Navigation concluded by the two states on August 25, 1935, each party reserved to vessels flying its own flag the right to fish in its coastal waters up to a limit of ten nautical miles. They reaffirmed the 10-mile fishing zone in the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of March 25, 1940. Beyond the 10-mile zone, fishing was allowed only to Soviet and Iranian nationals. The Treaty was silent on seabed mining.)(Mehdiyoun, p. 180. Footnote Treaty of Establishment, Commerce and Navigation, with Final Protocols and Annex, Aug. 25, 1935, Iran-USSR, Art. 15,176 LNTS 301,317.

Greenhouse_Solutions_with_Sustainable_Energy
Image:Alternative Energies.jpg|thumb|The wind, Sun, and biomass are three renewable energy sourcesGreenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy is a 2007 book by Australian academic Diesendorf.  The book puts forward a setof policies and strategies for implementing the most promising energy technologies by all spheres of government, business and community organisations. Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy suggests that a mix of energy use, energy sources and gas (as a transitional fuel) offers a clean and feasible energy future for Australia.(UNSW Press. : Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy)Structure and themesThe book is a comprehensive guide to sustainable energy systems( Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy: Review by Patrick ONeill Chain Reaction 100, August 2007.) and is structured in three sections:*Introduction to the basic concepts and latest scientific evidence regarding global warming.*Assessment of energy technologies, including coal, nuclear and more sustainable alternatives.*Discussion of policies and strategies needed to overcome the non-technical barriers to renewable energies and energy efficiency.(Scientific approach to an emotional  and political  issue ECOS, June-July 2007, p.31.)Diesendorf argues that:*Ecologically sustainable energy technologies based on energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural gas are commercially available today, and that their implementation could halve Australias gas emissions within a few decades.*To implement these technologies, new policies must be developed and implemented by all three levels of government.*The main barriers are neither technical nor economic, but rather our social institutions and the political power of the big greenhouse gas emitting industries: coal, oil, aluminium, cement and motor vehicles.(Wind power variabilityEarly in his career, Mark Diesendorf was a principal research scientist with CSIRO where he was involved in early research on integrating power into electricity grids.  This issue is discussed in some detail in Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy.Diesendorf explains that large-scale wind power is not intermittent, because it does not start up or switch off instantaneously.  In practice, the variations in thousands of wind turbines, spread out over several different sites and wind regimes, are smoothed.  As the distance between sites increases, the correlation between wind speeds measured at those sites, decreases.  This has been confirmed recently by studies conducted by Sinden from University:(Diesendorf, Mark (2007). Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy, p. 119.)Sinden analysed over 30 years of hourly wind speed data from 66 sites spread out over the United Kingdom.  He found that the correlation coefficient of wind power fell from 0.6 at 200 km to 0.25 at 600 km separation (a perfect correlation would have a coefficient equal to 1.0.) There were no hours in the data set where wind speed was below the cut-in wind speed of a modern wind turbine throughout the United Kingdom, and low wind speed events affecting more than 90 per cent of the United Kingdom had an average recurrent rate of only one hour per year.(Diesendorf goes on to say that every conventional power station breaks down unexpectedly from time to time, causing an immediate loss of all its power.  That is true intermittency, according to Diesendorf, and it is a particular type of variability that switches between full power and no power.  Once a conventional power station has broken down, it may be offline for weeks, much longer than windless periods.(Diesendorf, Mark (2007). Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy, p. 118.)Quotes*The enhanced greenhouse effect is arguably the most dangerous environmental problem and the most difficult political issue to be faced by the world in the 21st century. (p. 1)  *The recent push for a revival of nuclear energy has been based on its claimed reduction in CO2 emissions where it substitutes for coal-fired power stations.  In reality, only reactor operation is CO2-free.  All other stages of the nuclear fuel chain -- mining, milling, fuel fabrication, enrichment, reactor construction, decommissioning, and waste management -- use fossil fuels and hence emit CO2... (p. 252)*Global wind-power capacity continues to expand and, apart from the blip in 2006, its costs continue to decline steadily.  Wind power is one of the few energy supply technologies that are ready for wide dissemination today, unlike coal with CO2 capture and sequestration and unlike nuclear power.  Wind can deliver deep cuts in CO2, while providing a hedge against fluctuating fossil fuel prices and reducing energy import dependence. (p. 126)Critical receptionDick Nichols, in Green Left, states that Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy brings together much useful material about global warming and possible solutions: :Diesendorfs book concentrates into one volume a succinct analysis of global warming, a rebuttal of climate change scepticism, a thorough summary of the state of development of each renewable energy technology, a masterly demolition of false solutions to greenhouse (like sequestration and nuclear power) and a presentation of strategies and policies for uprooting carbon-intensive power production in Australia.  Add in chapters on saving energy and transport and urban redesign and Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy illuminates the reader about all the main features of the many-sided debate on how to make sustainable energy production the heart of the attack on climate change.(Dick Nichols, How can sustainable energy solve greenhouse? Green Left, 5 April 2008.)Nichols suggests that if theres one serious shortcoming in Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy its a failure to consistently trace what rate of implementation of energy efficiency and uptake of renewable energy sources is necessary to confront the greenhouse emergency.Patrick ONeill, in Chain Reaction,  suggests that Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy is a comprehensive guide to sustainable energy systems, and that the book is simply a joy to read.  ONeill explains that whilst an immense amount of technical and scientific detail is presented, the language is simple and the book is well laid out. It also covers often ignored areas of the sustainable energy discussion such as population issues, morality, social justice and equity. In conclusion, ONeill states that the book is a wonderfully energising piece of sedition, which calls for a coordinated national strategy for non-violent action.(George Wilkenfield, in Australian Review of Public Affairs, is more critical and suggests the book feels strangely anachronistic, partly because it treats climate change as an issue that can be resolved through grassroots activism or by the opposition of protest movements to unjust regimes. Wilkenfield explains that this rather misses the point that the continuing rise in global greenhouse gas emissions is not a byproduct of injustice or repression but of economic freedom in the West and the unrelenting economic growth by which repressive regimes such as Chinas buy legitimacy. In general, very few people want to be freed from consumptionmost want the freedom to consume even more.  Wilkenfield goes on to say that Diesendorf misses some of the dynamics of consumption: energy use gives people comfort, speed, privacy and convenience. Many people actually enjoy driving and like their cars, and would continue to use them as long as they could afford to, even if public transport were available.(George Wilkenfield, Cutting greenhouse emissionsWhat would we do if we really meant it? Australian Review of Public Affairs, August 2007.) Nevertheless, in the end, Wilkenfield concedes that Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy is very suitable as a textbook, or as a handbook for activists, journalists or the more committed reader who is not afraid of numbers.(AuthorMark Diesendorf teaches and researches sustainable development and greenhouse solutions at the Institute of Environmental Studies at the of NSW. Previously he has been a Principle Research Scientist at CSIRO, Professor of Environmental Science at UTS and Vice-President of the Australia New Zealand Society for Ecological Economics.( Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy -- Free symposium)See also*movement in Australia*of global warming on Australia*of Australian environmental books*Time (book)*energy commercialization in Australia*power in Australia*development*Clean Tech Revolution*power in AustraliaReferencesBibliography*Diesendorf, Mark (2007).

William_N._Vaile
William Newell Vaile (June 22, 1876 &ndash; July 2, 1927) was a U.S. Representative from Colorado.Born in Indiana, Vaile moved with his parents to Colorado, in 1881. He attended the public schools and graduated from University in 1898. During the War, he served as a private in the First Regiment of the Connecticut Volunteer Field Artillery from May 19, 1898, to October 25, 1898.Vaile studied law at the University of Colorado in 1899 and Law School in 1900-01. He was admitted to the bar in 1901 and began his practice in Colorado. He was counsel for the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad, 190116, and he served as County Attorney for Jefferson County from 1911 to 1914. He married Kate Rothwell Varrell on June 14, 1914. Valie was a Republican candidate for Congress in 1916.(Bench and bar of Colorado (1917)/Portraits, accessed July 9, 2010) He served on the Mexican border from June 28 to December 1, 1916, as a second lieutenant in the First Separate Battalion, National Guard of Colorado.Vaile was elected as a Republican to the Sixty-sixth and to the four succeeding Congresses, serving from March 4, 1919, until his death on July 2, 1927. He served as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of the Treasury (Sixty-eighth Congress, March 4, 1923 to March 4, 1925).Congressman Vaile co-sponsored the Cummins-Vaile Bill which was introduced on April 8, 1924. It was the first birth control bill to reach debate in Congress of the United States.(, p.262.)Congressman Vaile was a noted restrictionist.(, p.145.) He was a prominent supporter of the United States Immigration Act of 1924, also known as the National Origins Act, Johnson-Reed Act, or the Immigration Quota Act of 1924. This legislation  limited the number of immigrants who could be admitted from any country to 2% of the number of people from that country who were already living in the United States in 1890 according to the census of 1890. These quotas remained in place with minor alterations until the and Nationality Act of 1965. They had the intended effect of shifting immigration dramatically from Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe to Northern and Western Europe with the foreseeable ethnic results.(Naturalization Acts -- ALL -- Legislation timeline, accessed July 9, 2010)In the Fall of 1925, Vaile published a novel, The Mystery of Golconda, which dealt with life in the mining camps of the Rocky Mountains.(, 301 pages.)During his life, Vaile was a member of the University Club (Denver), the Cactus Club, Masonic orders, the Spanish War Veterans, the Denver Civic and Commercial Association, and the Denver School League.(, p.268.)On July 2, 1927, Congressman Vaile died of a sudden heart attack as he was traveling by car with friends and family to Grand Lake near Mountain National Park for the Fourth of July.(The New York Times, Congressman Vaile Dies In Automobile, July 3, 1927, pg.

Asahel_W._Hubbard
Asahel Wheeler Hubbard (January 19, 1819 - September 22, 1879) was an attorney, judge, Indiana legislator, and three-term Republican U.S. Representative from 6th congressional district during the Civil War and the first stage of the Reconstruction era.  He was the father of Iowa Congressman H. Hubbard.Born in Connecticut, Hubbard attended the public schools.  He worked as a stonecutter.  He subsequently pursued his studies at a select school in Connecticut.  He moved to Indiana, in 1838, where he was employed as a book agent and taught school.  He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1841 and commenced practice in Rushville.  He served as member of the House of Representatives from 1847 to 1849.  In 1857, he moved to City, Iowa, and engaged in the estate business.  He served as judge of the fourth district from 1859 to 1862.In 1862, after the United States Census caused Iowas seats in the U.S. House to increase from two to six, Hubbard became the first Congressman to represent Iowas 6th congressional district. Re-elected twice, he served in the Thirty-eighth, Thirty-ninth, and Fortieth Congresses. He was influential in securing legislation which hastened the building of several lines of railroad through his district, besides securing to City a branch of the Pacific Railroad.(Benjamin F.  Gue, History of Iowa From the Earliest Times to the Beginning of the Twentieth Century, Vol. 4 (Asahel W. Hubbard), p. 137(1902).) He was not a candidate for renomination in 1868. In all, he served in Congress from March 4, 1863 to March 3, 1869. Hubbard was one of the organizers of the National Bank of Sioux City in 1871, and served as its president until January 15, 1879. He also had interests in railroad building in Iowa and in a mining property in Colorado. He died in Sioux City on September 22, 1879.  He was interred in Cemetery.In 1880, Nebraska was named in honor of Asahel W. Hubbard.  ReferencesW. Hubbard

Liquation
Liquation is a metallurgical method for separating metals from an ore or alloy. The material must be heated until one of the metals starts to melt and drain away from the other and can be collected. This method was largely used to remove lead containing silver from copper, but it can also be used to remove antimony minerals from ore, and refine tin. Separating copper and silver The first known use of Liquation on a large scale was in Germany in the mid-15th century. Metal workers had long known that Central European copper ore was rich in silver, so it was only a matter of time until a method was discovered that could separate the two metals.(Lynch, M., 2003. Mining in World History. London: Reaktion Books.) Process The 16th century process of separating copper and silver using liquation, described by Agricola in his 1556 treatise re metallica,(Hoover, H.C. and Hoover L.H., 1950. De re metallica / Georgius Agricola. New York: Dover.) remained almost unchanged until the 19th century when it was replaced by cheaper and more efficient processes such as sulphatization and eventually electrolytic methods.(Sisco, A.G. and Smith, C.S., 1951. Lazarus Erckers Treatise on ores and assaying. Chicago, Ill.: University of Chicago Press.)Liquation requires that the silver-rich copper first be melted with approximately three times its weight in lead, as silver has a greater affinity with lead most of the silver would end up within this rather than the copper.(Tylecote, R. F., 1992. A history of metallurgy. 2nd ed. London: Institute of Metals.) If the copper is assayed and found to contain too little silver for liquation to be financial viable (around 0.31% is the minimum required () it is melted and allowed to settle so that much of the silver sinks towards the bottom. The tops are then drawn off and used to produce copper while the silver-rich bottoms are used in the liquation process.( The copper-lead alloy created can be tapped off and cast into large plano-convex ingots known as liquation cakes. As the metals cool and solidify the copper and the silver-containing lead separate as they are immiscible with each other.The ratio of lead to copper in these cakes is an important factor for the process to work efficiently. Agricola recommended 3 parts copper to 8-12 parts lead. The copper must be assayed to accurately determine how much silver it contains, for copper rich in silver the top end of this ratio was used to make sure the maximum amount of silver possible would end up within the lead. However there also needs to be enough copper to allow the cakes to keep their shape once most of the lead has drained away, too much copper and it would trap some of the lead within and the process would be very inefficient.(The size of these cakes has remained consistent from when Agricola wrote of them in 1556 to the 19th century when the process became obsolete. They were usually between 2  to 3  inches (6.4 to 8.9 cm) thick, about 2 feet (0.61m) in diameter and weighed from 225 to 375 lbs (102 kg to 170 kg). This consistency is not without reason as the size of the cakes is very important to the smooth running of the liquation process. If the cakes are too small, the product would not be worth the time and costs spent on the process, if they are too large then the copper would begin to melt before the maximum amount of lead has drained away.(The cakes are heated in a liquation furnace, usually four or five at once, to a temperature above the point of lead (327C), but below that of copper (1084C), so that the silver-rich lead melts and flows away.(Dungworth, D. & Nicholas, M., 2004. Caldarium? An antimony bronze used for medieval and post-medieval cast domestic vessels in Historical metallurgy : journal of the Historical Metallurgy Society, 38(1), pages 24-34.) As the melting point of lead is so low a high temperature furnace is not required and it can be fuelled with wood.( It is important that this takes place in a reducing atmosphere, i.e.one with little oxygen, to avoid the lead oxidising, the cakes are therefore well covered by charcoal and little air is allowed into the furnace.( It is impossible to stop some of the lead oxidising however and this drops down and forms spiky projections known as liquation thorns in the channel underneath the hearth.( The older and relatively simple method of cupellation can then be used to separate the silver from the lead. If the lead is assayed and found not to contain enough silver to make the cupellation process worthwhile it is reused in liquation cakes until it has sufficient silver.(The exhausted liquation cakes which still contain some lead and silver are dried in a special furnace which is heated to a higher temperature under oxidising conditions. This is essentially just another stage of liquation and most of the remaining lead is expelled and oxidised to form liquation thorns, though some remains as lead metal. The copper can then be refined to remove other impurities and produce copper metal.(Waste products can be reused to produce new liquation cakes to try and minimise loss of metals, especially silver.( The waste products are mostly in the form of liquation thorns from the liquation and the drying process but there are also some slags produced.Loss of MetalThis process is not 100% efficient. At the Lautenthal, Altenau, and Andreasberg smelting-works in the Harz between the years 1857 and 1860 25% of the silver, 25.1% of the lead and 9.3% of the copper was lost. Some of this is lost in slag that is not worth reusing, some is lost by what is termed burning, and some of the silver is lost to the refined copper.(Percy, J., 1880. Metallurgy: the art of extracting metals from their ores: Silver and Gold. London: John Murray.) It is clear therefore that a constant supply of lead was needed to make up for that lost at various stages. First instances Liquation is first documented in the archives of the municipal foundry in Nuremberg in 1453. Nuremberg was one of Germanys main centres of metal refining and fabrication, and was a leader in metallurgical techniques. Five liquation plants soon sprang up around the city, and within 15 years had spread throughout Germany, Poland and the Alps.( This is often regarded as the beginning of liquation, but evidence suggests liquation may have existed in smaller-scale use centuries earlier. The sophisticated nature of the 15th century liquation plants with custom-made furnaces would be surprising for a new technology. There was also a far simpler but more labour intensive version of the method brought to Japan by the Portuguese in 1591; this is possibly the remnants of an earlier European method.(Hawthorne, J.G. and Smith, C.S., 1976. On Divers Arts by Theophilus. Chicago; London: University of Chicago Press.)Agricola discusses various different types of copper produced from the liquation process; one of these is caldarium or cauldron copper which contains a high level of lead and was used to make medieval cauldrons. Analysis of 13th century cauldrons shows that they are made out of copper with a low level of silver and high levels of lead which would match that produced by liquation.( Liquation may even have existed as early as the 12th century; in Theophilus On Divers Arts he makes a possible reference to liquation:When the stone begins to soften, lead flows out through certain small cavities and copper is left inside. (However, he was not an expert in metallurgy, so his writings may not be accurate, and though there were similar cauldrons in the 12th century, no compositional analysis has been published that supports this theory.(Against the idea that this process was used significantly before it became widespread in the mid-15th century, is the fact that it had to be done on a large-scale to be financially viable. There is no evidence of large-scale liquation before Nuremberg. Also, efficient liquation requires an extremely skilled practitioner.  Anyone with that much skill is unlikely to spend much time on something unprofitable.(Some suggest liquation existed even earlier. Babylonian texts from Mari mention that mountain copper was washed to produce washed copper and that lead was used with silver to produce washed silver. Some say this shows liquation was being carried out in the East as early as the millennium BC. Crucially, however, these texts do not specifically mention lead being used with copper to produce silver, as would be expected for liquation.(Kalyanaraman, S., 1998. Electrum, gold, silver: Soma in the Rigveda. http://www.scribd.com/doc/2670091/Electrum-Gold-and-Silver) Importance John U. Nef, an expert on Renaissance economics, described liquation as even more important than the invention of the press for the development of industry during this period.(Nef, J.U., 1941. Industrial Europe at the Time of the Reformation (ca. 1515--ca. 1540). The Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 49, No. 1 (Feb), pp. 1-40. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.) It increased production of silver on a massive scale. Between 1460 and 1530, the output of silver increased as much as fivefold in central Europe.(Nef, J.U., 1987. Mining and metallurgy in medieval civilization from (ed) Pastan, M.M., The Cambridge economic history of Europe, Vol.2: Trade and industry in the Middle Ages pp691-761. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.) This had a secondary effect of lowering the costs of producing copper at a time when its demand had increased due to the needs of the brassmaking industry,( and the use of copper on ships and roofs. Lead production also received a boost, indeed the lack of lead available held the liquation process back until a large lead-bearing seam was discovered at Tarnowitz in Poland.(Liquation triggered an increase in mining operations, and a new class of wealthy merchants clamoured to participate. Some of the wealthiest merchants in Europe invested in mining, including the French Royal Banker Coeur and the powerful Medici family of Florence. However, most of the funds came from merchants in neighbouring towns. For example the burghers of Nuremberg funded mines in the mountains of Bohemia and the Harz.(Many new copper and silver mines sprang up. A mines at Joachimstal, in the Erzgebirge, was so successful that a coin called the Joachimstaler was created, which led to the term, dollar.( Others of note included Schneeberg, and Annaberg (also in the Erzgebirge), Schwaz, in the valley of the Inn, and at Neusohl in Hungary. The new mining wealth allowed some of the largest mines of previous centuries to reopen, such as the silver-bearing lead and copper of Rammelsberg. These old mines had previously been abandoned due to flooding, collapses, lack of technology, or simply a lack of money. Now shafts could be sunk deeper and water more efficiently drained, so miners could work seams once out of reach.(Liquation-based wealth helped build roads between mining and processing regions, and financed improvements to mining technology. Thus its influence went beyond just increasing silver and copper production. It helped revive the economy of large parts of Europe, and the mining of other metals such as iron and mercury.

Buffalo_Creek_and_Gauley_Railroad
 website           The Buffalo Creek and Gauley Railroad (BC&G) was a railroad chartered on April 1, 1904(Reflections on Swandale) and ran along Creek in Clay County, Virginia. The original Buffalo Creek and Gauley ended service in 1965.The BC&G was one of the last all-railroads, never operating a locomotive to the day it shut down in 1965.(James A. Neubauer, In the footsteps of David and Doc, , September 2003, p. 38)  Its primary purpose was to bring coal out of the mountains above Widen to an interchange with the and Ohio Railroad at Dundon.RouteBeginning at Dundon, the line ran east along Buffalo Creek to a terminus  away at Widen.().  Along the way, it passed marked locations at Avoca, Sand Fork, the towns of Cressmont and Swandale, and Eakle. Swandale contained the sawmill for lumber operations of the Elk River Coal and Lumber Company and there was a small dairy at Cressmont. The railroad hits the end of the line once it runs into the Rich Run Coal mines yard in Widen.At Avoca, the ERC&L logging line ran about  out in the woods where the logging was done during the final years of operations.After the BC&G ended operations in 1965 it was reactivated in 1971 by the Majestic Mining Company to serve a mine at Widen.  The company used an Alco S-2 for power and the operation concluded in 1985.  The line was then again reactivated in the mid-1990s when the Elk River Railroad, Inc. (TERRI) reopened the route to Avoca to serve a mine there.  The operation lasted only a few years until 1999 when American Electric Power (AEP) determined the coal to be too poor in quality.EquipmentSome of the BC&Gs equipment, as well as that of its sister railroad the Elk River Coal & Lumber Co. have been preserved, some in operating condition.  BC&G Consolidation #4 is owned by the Carolina Transportation Museum in Spencer, Carolina.  It operated in tourist service until a couple of years ago.  It is now undergoing a complete restoration.  BC&G Consolidation #13 is owned by the Ohio Central and ran in excursion service a number of years ago.  Consolidation #14 is on static display in Gaithersburg, Maryland.ERC&L Shay #19 is on display in Ohio.  Climax #3 is owned by the Camp and Big Trees Railroad in California, but is not servicable.The ERC&Ls American log loader and bobber logging caboose are both restored and on display at the Scenic Railroad State Park in Cass, Virginia.At one time the River Railroad ran modern diesels from Gassaway, through Dundon and a branch to a coal loading facility at Avoca then from Dundon to Hartland.RestorationCurrently the Buffalo Creek & Gauley Co-op has been in the process of opening up much of the old main line and have run some speeder excursions from Dundon.ReferencesExternal links* BC&G photos* Mountain State Railroad & Logging Historical Association* Buffalo Creek and Gauley history

Education_in_Coimbra
Since early ages, Coimbra developed into an important cultural centre, firstly due to the school founded in 1131 in the Cruz Monastery, essential on medieval times and a meeting point for the intellectual and power elites, where famous medieval figures studied, like Saint Anthony of Lisbon. Later the city saw its educational and cultural importance greatly improved because of the establishment of the of Coimbra which was founded in the 13th century in Lisbon, was moved in 1308 for the first time to Coimbra and was settled definitely in the city in 1537. For this old tradition in education, Coimbra is called A cidade dos estudantes (The city of the students) and Lusa-Atenas (Lusitanic-Athens, after Athens in Greece), because it is a center of culture and erudition, as well as the site of the oldest university which turned Coimbra into a noted town. Basic and secondary education The city has a large number of public and private basic and secondary schools, among these some of the best-ranked in the country, like Escola Secundria Infanta D. Maria (public) and Colgio Rainha Santa Isabel (private), as well as several kindergartens and nurseries.The state-run secondary schools and 2nd and 3rd cycle of basic education schools in the municipality of Coimbra are the following:*Escola bsica dos 2 e 3 ciclos Dra. Maria Alice Gouveia*Escola bsica dos 2 e 3 ciclos de Ins de Castro *Escola bsica dos 2 e 3 ciclos de Taveiro *Escola bsica dos 2 e 3 ciclos de Ceira *Escola bsica dos 2 e 3 ciclos da Pedrulha *Escola bsica dos 2 e 3 ciclos de Eugnio de Castro *Escola secundria de D. Duarte *Escola secundria de Jaime Corteso *Escola secundria de Avelar Brotero *Escola secundria com 3 ciclo do ensino bsico de D. Dinis *Escola secundria Infanta D. Maria *Escola secundria com 3 ciclo do ensino bsico da Quinta das Flores *Escola bsica dos 2 e 3 ciclos de S. Silvestre *Escola bsica dos 2 e 3 ciclos de Martim de Freitas *Escola secundria de Jos Falco *Escola bsica dos 2 e 3 ciclos do Poeta Manuel da Silva GaioThere is also the Coimbra Hotel and Tourism School. Tertiary education  Public university The of Coimbra, a university, is one of the oldest universities in continuous operation in Europe and the World, the oldest university in countries, and one of the largest education and research institutions of Portugal. It is organized into eight different faculties according to a wide range of fields, granting all the highest academic degrees in architecture, education, engineering, humanities, law, mathematics, medicine, natural sciences, psychology, social sciences and sports. It is among the Portuguese higher education institutions with the highest selectiveness and the largest number of applicants every year. It demands high entrance exam scores for admission into a large number of its most reputed departments. Public polytechnic The Politcnico de Coimbra (Polytechnical Institute of Coimbra), a public institution of polytechnic education in Coimbra, has been in operation since 1988, although some of its current schools were providing degrees independently since the 1970s, and even before some were technical or vocational schools (for instance, the agriculture school - Superior Agrria de Coimbra - whose origins can be dated back to the 19th century, or the current engineering institute - Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra - formerly an industrial school of intermediate education in operation between 1965 and 1974). It comprises several autonomous schools in engineering, education, accountancy, and agriculture, whose entrance and teaching requirements were less demanding than the University of Coimbras until the adoption of several new selective admission criteria in 2005 (access rules to state-run institutions have enforced minimum grades of 95/200 in the national access examinations for all students nationwide) and a number of gradual changes in the higher education initiated in 1998 - particularly the right to start providing licenciatura degrees like the universities, the enforced minimum grades in the access examinations since 2005, and finally, a gradual shift towards the process in 2006 and 2007. Its schools currently have a number of reputed courses which are as selective or popular as certain average departments courses of the University of Coimbra, and in general they are allowed to award comparable degrees in some fields, excluding doctorate degrees. Other institutions The Superior de Enfermagem de Coimbra, a public school providing degrees since the 1990s, but whose origins as a nursing and health training school can be dated back to the early 20th century, is other state-run learning institution in the city. There are also private higher learning schools and institutes such as the Superior Miguel Torga, the Superior Bissaya Barreto, the Universitria das Artes de Coimbra, and the Universitria Vasco da Gama, which are not generally considered as prestigious as the old university, but some are noted for awarding degrees in fields not offered by it.The city hosts also a regional branch of the University Open University, a state-run institution of education.The long history and reputation of the University of Coimbra caused several newer public and private institutions of higher education created after 1974, to unofficially attach themselves to the good name and notability of the historical old university in order to boost its marketing efforts and promote their image among potential students interested for studying in the city. This also happened with a few degrees offered by the old university itself which were never particularly reputed neither for strict selectiveness nor distinctive teaching standards (like, for example, UCs degrees in mining and geological engineering which were discontinued in the early 2000s due to lack of curricular academic integrity). Student traditions Born in the old of Coimbra, the das Latas and the das Fitas are two important student festivities in the city, and are part of the acadmica (academic praxis) of Coimbra.In general, almost all students from the different public and private institutions present today in the city, adopt and internally adapt the traditional student rituals and celebrate the festivities born in the ancient University of Coimbra (UC) like the acadmica and the das Fitas which are yearly organized by UCs students. Non-UC students are invited to participate in the UCs public parties like Queima das Fitas and Festa das Latas parades through the streets of the town and in addition have their own adaptations for the rituals that are performed independently by school/institute.See also*in Portugal

Longford,_Coventry
right|thumb|Longford Road, Coventry (looking south)Longford is a ward in the north of Coventry, West Midlands, England. It is covered by the Coventry North East constituency(Coventry City Council: Longford Ward) and bounded by the wards of Holbrooks, Henley, Upper Stoke and Foleshill. Neighbourhoods covered by the ward include Longford Village, Foxford, Rowleys Green, Aldermans Green, Hawkesbury, Bell Green, Manor House, Hall Green, Courthouse Green, Woodshires and Little Heath.(Coventry City Council: About Longford Ward)Longford is mainly residential, but it also has industrial areas and a few green areas, such as Longford Park and Longford Community Nature Park, which are in close proximity on opposite sides of Longford Road. In the north of the ward is the Arena, home to City Football Club. Also part of the complex is Arena Park a Retail Centre including a Tesco Extra. Riley Square shopping centre is another shopping centre in the ward. Longford is also served by two libraries: Arena Park Library and Bell Green Library.(The UK Census found that there were 17,601 people living in Longford, with a population density of 37.3 per square kilometre. 738 people were students. Longford has an area of 472 square kilometres. The number of people who were unemployed in Longford was 522 according to the for National Statistics in June 2006. 12,409 people were of a age. The largest employer in the ward in 2004 was Henley College.(Coventry City Council: Longford in numbers)EducationSchool and Community Arts College is the areas main Secondary School, headteacher Ruth Williamson. There is alsoGrangehurst Primary School.Historyright|thumb|The church of St Thomas the Apostle, Longford Road, CoventryThe area is referred to as early as the 15th century, stating that there were houses and cottages in the areas of Longford and Foxford however these had not developed to form hamlets. A census in 1730 stated that there were only 20 houses in Longford and Foxford. Longford began to develop in the mid-18th century when the ribbon weaving industry and a flourishing coal mine at Hawkesbury encouraged workers and their families to move into Longford. It was now on the main route from the mining districts of Nuneaton and Bedworth to Coventry.Canalsright|thumb|Coventry canal, the towpath, and one of bridges on the Longford Rd in Longford.The Canal passes through the area. On the towpath is a sculpture named The Stone Sofa, by Tim Shutter. Unveiled on May 31, 1997, it was commissioned by Groundwork Coventry as part of the Coventry Canal Art Trail, and is owned by the City Development Directorate at Coventry City Council.

James_A._Baker_(trade_unionist)
James A Baker (fl. 1899 &ndash; 1903) was a Canadian miner who spent four years in Slocan, which was in south eastern Columbia. He was a member of the  Federation of Miners and became an elected official and the regional representative during a period of particularly bitter strikes.It appears that the organizational part of the job wore him down and he did not stand for re-election in 1903. At that point he disappears from historical documentation. He left a legacy of a more militant and leftist B.C. mining unionism.

William_Flinn
William Flinn (1851&mdash;1924) was a powerful political boss  and construction magnate in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, States. Along with Magee (1848&mdash;1901), his political partner, the two ran the Republican Party machine that controlled the city for the final twenty years of the 19th century. Early lifeHe was born in England on May 26, 1851 to John Flinn and Mary Hamilton Flinn, Irish immigrants there. The family next emigrated later that year to the United States and settled in Pittsburghs Sixth Ward, famous for its hard-scrabble politics, where his father established a small contracting business.Educated in the Public Schools, William Flinn dropped out at age 9 to deliver newspapers, shine shoes, and later apprentice in the gas and steam fitting trades.PoliticsFlinn became politically active in the Republican Party as a ward boss collecting stray votes. He soon attained office in 1877 as a member of the Board of Fire Commissioners. Flinn quickly partnered with Christopher Magee (18481901), the citys Republican Party political boss. In 1881 Flinn was elected to the General Assembly at Harrisburg. In 1882 he was appointed chairman of the citys executive committee of the local Republican party, a position he held for the next 20 years. In 1890 he was elected to the State Senate, where he sponsored the Good Roads Act, which became law in 1895. He remained incumbent there until his resignation in 1901. From 1884 until 1912 he served as a delegate to every National Convention.BusinessFlinns chief business interest was large-scale contracting. His firm of and Flinn was formed in 1876 in association with James J. Booth. As a result of politics and a lowest responsible bidder scheme, Booth & Flinn won most large construction and paving contracts in Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania, where they built streets, trolley lines, and bridges, usually amid charges by competitors of graft. The firm built the Tunnels, Wabash Tunnel, and Armstrong Tunnels in Pittsburgh, and in the later years of the companys continuation, the Tunnel between York City and Jersey. (Booth retired from the firm in 1898; George H. Flinn, son of the founder, succeeded him, and in 1924 two other sons, William and A. Rex Flinn joined the company).In Shame of the Cities, the landmark 1903 book by Steffens on political corruption in American cities, Steffens wrote about the alleged Flinn-Magee collusion: Magee wanted power, Flinn wealth.... Magee spent his wealth for more power, and Flinn spent his power for more wealth.... Magee attracted followers, Flinn employed them. He was useful to Magee, Magee was indispensable to him. ... Molasses and vinegar, diplomacy and force, mind and will, they were well mated. Reformers eventually reined in Flinn by passing legislation to curb corruption and kickbacks.William Flinn was also president of the Duquesne Lumber Company and the Pittsburgh Silver Peak Gold Mining Company. He sat on the board of directors of the Arkansas Fuel Oil Company, the Arkansas Natural Gas Company, the Oil Corporation, and the Coal Company.Personal lifeHe married Nancy Galbraith in 1874 and the couple had six children: four boys, two girls. The sonsWilliam, George, Ralph, and A. Rexbecame prominent in business, three of them in their fathers construction firm. The family home, called Braemar, was in the city Highland Park district. Though raised Catholic, Flinn was a member of Pittsburghs Sixth United Presbyterian Church.RetirementFlinns political and business organization began to crumble in the late 1890s when a flap over the rigged bidding system came to a head with Manning Bigelow, director of public works. By the 1902 elections reformers held sway and citizens voted down the machine. Magee himself had died in 1901 after a short illness. Flinn withdrew from local politics, as a result, and retired to a country estate north of the city called Beechwood Farm. He became a gentleman farmer of cattle, German police dogs, and Belgian hares.He continued to manage his business interests and to dabble in Republican politics at the national life. In 1912, however, he abandoned the GOP in the support of Roosevelts nomination, and followed him into the Moose Party.During the winter months Flinn resided  in Florida, where at St. Petersburg he died on February 19, 1924 at the age of 72. He is interred at Cemetery in Pittsburgh. According the Register of Wills of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, J.N. Mackrell, Flinns personal property and real estate at his death exceeded $11 million. Flinn is honored with several monuments throughout the city of Pittsburgh and the Allegheny County segment of Pennsylvania State Route 8 is named the William Flinn Highway. His country estate is now a nature reserve, Farms Nature Reserve, operated by the Society of Western Pennsylvania. Flinns daughter Mary used some of her inheritance to build a country estate nearby Beechwood called Hartwood; today it is open to the public as a part of Acres Park.References***

United_States_Senate_election_in_North_Dakota,_1974
The 1974 Senate election for the state of Dakota was held November 5, 1974. The incumbent, Republican Senator Young, sought and received re-election to his fifth term, defeating Dakota Democratic-NPL Party candidate L. Guy, a former of North Dakota.(http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/1974election.pdf)Only Young filed as a Republican, and the endorsed Democrat candidate was L. Guy of North Dakota, who had served as Governor of the state from 1961 to 1973; and had presumably left the office to seek the senate seat. Young and Guy won the primary elections for their respective parties. Guy, who was very popular as governor throughout the state, and Young, who had a high approval rating as senator for the state, created the closest ever election for one of Dakotas senate seats. Young won the election by only 177 votes, and Guy retired from politics.Two independent candidates, R. Jungroth and C. Gardner, also filed before the deadline. Jungroths platform was based on his opposition to mining the states coal reserves.(Our Campaigns - Candidate - James R.

Hammer_Museum_(Haines,_AK)
For the Armand Hammer Museum, see Museumthumb|200px|right|The Hammer MuseumThe Hammer Museum, located in Alaska, U.S., is the first museum in the world dedicated to hammers. The museum was founded in 2002 and became a non-profit organization in 2004. (About the Hammer Museum) It features over 1,400 hammers and related tools, ranging from ancient times through the colonial days to the industrial era.MissionThe mission of the Hammer Museum is to research, identify, exhibit, and preserve the history and use of hammers for the education of the general public.HistoryThe museums founder, Dave Pahl, moved to Alaska from Ohio with the goal of becoming self-sufficient in 1973. He became a blacksmith and began informally collecting hand tools. His collection grew over the years through purchases, gifts, and hammer hunting expeditions. In 2001, Pahl and his wife Carol purchased a hundred-year-old building in Haines and intended to turn the space into a museum. If there was any doubt about the plan, Dave uncovered a ceremonial Tlingit warriors pick while digging a foundation for the building. The museum opened in 2002 and became a non-profit organization in 2004. Most of the hammers on display are on permanent loan from the Pahl collection, but the museum actively collects new acquisitions. For a complete history, see the website. (About the Hammer Museum)CollectionsThe Hammer Museum has several galleries featuring hammers used for Blacksmithing, early trades, industry, and specific materials such as metal, stone, and wood. The collection has traditional hammers such as those used in mining, ranching, carpentry, the railroad industry, and auto-body repair. Others include those that served bankers, nightclub goers of the 1920s and 1930s, barristers, cobblers, and musicians, as well as those in the medical profession such as doctors and dentists. Collection highlights include: an Egyptian dolerite ball, Roman battle heads, Tlingit warriors pick, over fifty hammer patents on display as well as both indoor and outdoor sculpture.External links* The Hammer Museum websiteReferences

Bugyi
longd19.08523Bugyi is a village in Pest county, Hungary.Bugyi is a village of 5149 residents on 11558 hectares and about 30kms south from Budapest. It is located at the intersection of roads connecting csa to Kiskunlachza and Taksony to Dabas and Kunpeszr, but it is not directly linked into major, state highways. The name of the town first appeared in official documents as Latin Bevd in 1321AD of a form Budymatheusfelde (translation: Matthew Bugy land). It is named from the personal names starting with Bud (from the verb to be) of the original czech/slavic settlers. Examples include: Budweis (to be wise), Budik (awaken), Budimir (peaceful). The -i suffix in Hungarian Bugy-i denotes of Bud. The place name has no etymological connection to the contemporary Hungarian common name bugyi, meaning womens panties.The township was fused from several medieval villages (Bugy, Vny, Rda, rbo). The regions natural and economic development was defined by the Danubes ancient river bank, which was drained in the 1920s. As a result of its various soil types and micro climate, the region is especially well suited for agricultural production; hence, its important role in providing the capital with fresh produce. The town neighbors an area of gravel mines, so its geography is spackled with mining lakes.One of Bugyis significant treasures is its rich flora and fauna. The areas rich bird and game life attracts hunters and nature lovers from home and abroad. The townships southwestern fields ease into the Kiskunsg National Park, which is known as one of Central-Europes birding paradises with its saline lakes and wetlands. Some of its rare treasures are the Great Bustard or the 9.4-hectare protected ancient marshlands most beautiful flower Iris Pumila.Bugyis historical landmarks are concentrated around its triangular Baroque main square. St. Adalbert Roman Catholic church, for example, was built in 1761AD by Count Kroly, I. Eszterhzy, Bishop of Vc. The Beleznay Castle hosted important Hungarian cultural figures in the distant past. Next to the Lutheran church, which was built in 1783AD, there is the so called shame stone, a monument probably from the time of the Avars. We can still find the marble head stones in the Jewish cemetery. At present, one of the towns most festive events is the harvest pageant every October.

Civilian_casualties_during_Operation_Allied_Force
Civilian casualties as a result of Allied Force were significant. Many of the people killed in the NATO airstrikes were widely reported to be civilians, both Serbs and Albanians. Rights Watch confirmed ninety incidents in which civilians died as a result of NATO bombing. It reported that as few as 489 and as many as 528 Yugoslav civilians were killed in the ninety separate incidents in Operation Allied Force.(Civilian Deaths in the NATO Air Campaign - The Crisis in Kosovo) According to Yugoslav Committee for Cooperation with UNICEF, the Yugoslav civilian victims are more than 1,200.()According to military historian Oren, for every Serbian soldier killed by NATO in 1999, four civilians died, constituting a casualty ratio of 4:1.(Michael Oren, UN report a victory for terror, Boston Globe 24-09-2009) Background  Incidents  April 5, 1999: Bombing of Aleksinac File:Aleksinac110499.jpg|thumb|200px|Damage in AleksinacThe 13th night of air strikes included the first major NATO mistake when an attack on a barracks on the southern mining town of Aleksinac resulted in missiles striking a residential area. Serb TV reported at least five dead and at least another 30 injured when the three missiles fell 600 m short of their target. The missiles struck apartments, an emergency centre and a medical dispensary, TV reports said. Commenting on the incident, Air Commodore Wilby of Nato said It is possible that one of our weapons fell short of the target.() April 12, 1999: Grdelica train bombing NATOs attack on a railway bridge hit a passenger train, killing 14 and leaving 16 injured. The Belgrade-Thessaloniki train had been crossing the bridge near Leskovac, southern Serbia as the air-launched missile released several miles away reached its target. April 14, 1999: Bombing of a refugee column On April 14, during daylight hours, NATO aircraft repeatedly bombed Albanian refugee movements over a twelve-mile (19 km) stretch of road between akovica and Deani in western Kosovo, killing seventy-three civilians and injuring thirty-six others Human rights could document. The attack began at 1:30 p.m. and persisted for about two hours, causing civilian deaths in numerous locations on the convoy route near the villages of Bistrazin, Gradis, Madanaj, and Meja. April 23, 1999: Serb Radio and Television headquarters bombing One of the largest incidents of civilian deaths, and certainly the largest in Belgrade, was the bombing of state Radio and Television (RTS) headquarters in Belgrade on April 23. As a consequence, sixteen RTS civilian technicians and workers were killed and sixteen were wounded.Dragoljub Milanovic was the director general of Serbian Radio and Television and belonged to former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevics Socialist Party of Serbia. He was found guilty and jailed for 10 years for intentional withholding information from his employees about the eventual bombing, which had a direct effect on the number of dead. The justification was media points from the west.(http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-87581976.html) April 27, 1999: First Bombing of Surdulica At least 16 civilians were killed after two NATO missiles hit a residential area in the southern town of Surdulica. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/329976.stm May 1, 1999: Bombing of a civilian bus At least 23 people died when a NATO missile aimed at the Luane bridge north of Pritina hit a passenger bus. May 7, 1999: Cluster bombing of Ni NATO confirmed that a bomb aimed at an airfield in the Yugoslav city of Ni hit a hospital and a market, killing 14 civilians. Local officials said that a further 60 people were injured in the daylight attack which left unexploded cluster bombs lying in gardens. May 7, 1999: Chinese embassy bombing A salvo of US JDAM GPS-guided bombs struck the embassy of the Republic of China in Belgrade, killing three Chinese diplomats and injuring 20 others. CIA director Tenet later admitted in congressional testimony that the CIA had organised the strike and that it was the only strike of the campaign organised by his agency, though he still claimed it was accidental. China has never accepted the US explanation for the incident. May 14, 1999: Bombing of Koria At least 100 civilians died after NATO bombed what it said were legitimate military targets in the village of Korisa, southern Kosovo. Footage broadcast by Serbian TV showed charred remains, including at least two children, smouldering homes and burning tractors. May 19, 1999: Belgrade hospital strike  A NATO bombing attack led to the deaths of at least three patients in a Belgrade hospital.Parts of the Dragia Miovi hospital, near a barracks in the Dedinje district, were reduced to rubble. NATO admitted a missile aimed at an army barracks in the Dedinje district, which is close to the hospital, went astray.() May 30, 1999: Bombing of Varvarin 11 civilians were reported killed and a further 40 injured when NATO bombers mounted a daylight raid on a bridge in Varvarin, south-central Serbia. Yugoslav sources said local people were attending the towns market when the attack happened at 1pm local time. Witnesses said four cars fell into the Morava river. Rescuers who went to aid of the injured were hit in the second attack.A first-hand account of what happened was published in the Times. One of their reporters visited the village shortly after the bombing. Photos of the military target and the civilian casualties are available at http://www.nato-tribunal.de/varvarin/photo_documentation.htm.Nato spokesman Jamie Shea said the alliance had bombed a legitimate designated military target.() May 30, 1999: Second Bombing of Surdulica NATO planes hit an old peoples home at a sanatorium in south-eastern Serbia killing at least 11 people.() May 31, 1999: Bombing of Novi Pazar At least 10 people were killed and 20 injured in a NATO missile attack on an apartment building in Pazar, southwest Serbia.() NATO strategy and claims From the very beginning of Operation Allied Force, minimizing civilian casualties was a major declared NATO concern. According to NATO, consideration of civilian casualties was fully incorporated into the planning and targeting process. All targets were looked at in terms of their military significance in relation to the collateral damage or the consequence that might be there, General Shelton said on April 14: Then every precaution is made...so that collateral damage is avoided. According to Lt. Gen. Short, collateral damage drove us to an extraordinary degree. General Clark committed hours of his day dealing with the allies on issues of collateral damage. (Civilian Deaths in the NATO Air Campaign - The Crisis in Kosovo)Then-NATO spokesman Shea said There is always a cost to defeat an evil, he said. It never comes free, unfortunately. But the cost of failure to defeat a great evil is far higher. He insisted NATO planes had bombed only legitimate designated military targets and if more civilians had died it was because NATO had been forced into military action.( Human Rights Watch analysis Human Rights Watch documented and evaluated the impact and effects of the NATO military operation. Human Rights Watch confirmed ninety incidents in which civilians died as a result of NATO bombing. These included attacks where cluster bombs were dropped.(Civilian Deaths in the NATO Air Campaign - The Crisis in Kosovo) See also *Bombardment in the Kosovo War*Civilian casualties during the NATO intervention in Libya References  External links *Natos bombing blunders (BBC)*Civilian Deaths in the NATO Air Campaign - The Crisis in Kosovo (HRW)*List Of Incidents Involving Civilian Deaths in Operation Allied Force (HRW)*SELECT CHRONOLOGY OF NATO ATTACKS, MARCH 24-MAY 7, 1999 (HRW)

The particle size distribution (PSD) of a powder, or granular material, or particles dispersed in fluid, is a list of values or a mathematical function that defines the relative amounts of particles present, sorted according to size.(Jillavenkatesa A, Dapkunas S J, Lin-Sien Lum, Particle Size Characterization, NIST Special Publication 960-1, 2001)  PSD is also known as grain size distribution.(Sivakugan N, Soil Classification, James Cook University Geoengineering lecture handout, 2000)File:Bahco Example.JPG|thumb|right|altParticle Size Distribution of Coal-Fired Fly Ash.|A distribution of coal-fired Fly Ash.SignificanceThe PSD of a material can be important in understanding its physical and chemical properties.  It affects the strength and load-bearing properties of rocks and soils.  It affects the reactivity of solids participating in chemical reactions, and needs to be tightly controlled in many industrial products such as the manufacture of printer toner and cosmetics.Significance in the Collection of Particulate MatterParticle size distribution can greatly affect the efficacy of any collection device.  Settling Chambers will normally only collect very large particles, those that can be separated using sieve trays.Centrifugal Collectors will normally collect particles down to about 20 m.  Higher efficiency models can collect particles down to 10 m. Fabric Filters are one of the most efficient and cost effective types of dust collectors available and can achieve a collection efficiency of more than 99% for very fine particules.Wet Scrubbers that use liquid are commonly known as wet scrubbers. In these systems, the scrubbing liquid (usually water) comes into contact with a gas stream containing dust particles. The greater the contact of the gas and liquid streams, the higher the dust removal efficiency.Electrostatic Precipitators use electrostatic forces to separate dust particles from exhaust gases.  They can be very efficient at the collection of very fine particles.Nomenclaturep:  Actual particle density (g/cm3) g:  Gas or sample matrix density (g/cm3)r2:  Least-squares of determination.  The closer this value is to 1.0, the better the data fit to a straight-line.:  Gas free path (cm)D50:  Mass-median-diameter (MMD).  The log-normal distribution mass median diameter.  The MMD is considered to be the average particle diameter by mass.g:  standard deviation.  This value is determined mathematically by the equation::g  D84.13 / D50  D50 / D15.87The value of g determines the slope of the least-squares regression curve.:  Relative standard deviation or degree of polydispersity.  This value is also determined mathematically.  For values less than 0.1, the particulate sample can be considered to be monodisperse.:  g / D50Re(P) :  Particle Number.  In contrast to the large numerical values noted for flow Reynolds number, particle Reynolds number for fine particles in gaseous mediums is typically less than 0.1.Ref :  Flow number.Kn:  Particle number.TypesThe way PSD is expressed is usually defined by the method by which it is determined.  The most easily understood method of determination is analysis, where powder is separated on sieves of different sizes.  Thus, the PSD is defined in terms of discrete size ranges: e.g. % of sample between 45 m and 53 m, when sieves of these sizes are used.  The PSD is usually determined over a list of size ranges that covers nearly all the sizes present in the sample.  Some methods of determination allow much narrower size ranges to be defined than can be obtained by use of sieves, and are applicable to particle sizes outside the range available in sieves.  However, the idea of the notional sieve, that retains particles above a certain size, and passes particles below that size, is universally used in presenting PSD data of all kinds.The PSD may be expressed as a range analysis, in which the amount in each size range is listed in order.  It may also be presented in cumulative form, in which the total of all sizes retained or passed by a single notional sieve is given for a range of sizes.  Range analysis is suitable when a particular ideal mid-range particle size is being sought, while cumulative analysis is used where the amount of under-size or over-size must be controlled.The way in which size is expressed is open to a wide range of interpretations.  A simple treatment assumes the particles are spheres that will just pass through a square hole in a sieve.  In practice, particles are irregular - often extremely so, for example in the case of fibrous materials - and the way in which such particles are characterized during analysis is very dependent on the method of measurement used.SamplingBefore a PSD can be determined, it is vital that a representative sample is obtained.  In the case where the material to be analysed is flowing, the sample must be withdrawn from the stream in such a way that the sample has the same proportions of particle sizes as the stream.  The best way to do this is to take many samples of the whole stream over a period, instead of taking a portion of the stream for the whole time.()p.6  In the case where the material is in a heap, scoop or thief sampling needs to be done, which is inaccurate: the sample should ideally have been taken while the powder was flowing towards the heap.(p.10 After sampling, the sample volume typically needs to be reduced.  The material to be analysed must be carefully blended, and the sample withdrawn using techniques that avoid size segregation, for example using a rotary divider(p.5.  Particular attention must be paid to avoidance of loss of fines during manipulation of the sample.Measurement techniquesSieve analysisThis continues to be used for many measurements because of its simplicity, cheapness, and ease of interpretation.  Methods may be simple shaking of the sample in sieves until the amount retained becomes more or less constant.  Alternatively, the sample may be washed through with a non-reacting liquid (usually water) or blown through with an air current.  AdvantagesThis technique is well-adapted for bulk materials.  A large amount of materials can be readily loaded into  sieve trays.  Two common uses in the power industry are wet-sieving of milled limestone and dry-sieving of milled coal.DisadvantagesMany PSDs are concerned with particles too small for separation by sieving to be practical.  A very fine sieve, such as 37 m sieve, is exceedingly fragile, and it is very difficult to get material to pass through it.  Another disadvantage is that the amount of energy used to sieve the sample is arbitrarily determined.  Over-energetic sieving causes attrition of the particles and thus changes the PSD, while insufficient energy fails to break down loose agglomerates. Although manual sieving procedures can be ineffective, automated sieving technologies using image analysis software are available. These technologies can sieve material by capturing and analyzing a photo of material.Air elutriation analysisAn air elutriator is a simple device which can separate particles into two or more groups.Material may be separated by means of an elutriator, which consists of a vertical tube up which fluid is passed at a controlled velocity. When the particles are introduced, often through a side tube, the smaller particles are carried over in the fluid stream while the large particles settle against the upward current. If we start with low flow rates small less dense particle attain terminal velocites, and flow with the stream, the particle from the stream is collected in overflow and hence will be separated from the feed. Flow rates can be increased to separate higher size ranges. Further size fractions may be collected if the overflow from the first tube is passed vertically upwards through a second tube of greater cross-section, and any number of such tubes can be arranged in series.Technique Advantages:  A bulk sample is analyzed using centrifugal classification and the technique is non-descructive.  Each cut-point can be recovered for future size-respective chemical analyses.  This technique has been used for decades in the Air Pollution Control industry (data used for design of control devices).  This technique determines particle size as a function of settling velocity in an air stream (as opposed to water, or some other liquid).Technique Disadvantages:  A bulk sample (about ten grams) must be obtained.  It is a fairly time-consuming analytical technique.  The actual test method (http://catalog.asme.org/Codes/PDF/PTC_28_1965_Determining.cfm) has been withdrawn by ASME due to obsolescence.  Instrument calibration materials are therefore no longer available.PhotoanalysisMaterials can now be analysed through photoanalysis procedures.  Unlike sieve analyses which can be time-consuming and inaccurate, taking a photo of a sample of the materials to be measured and using software to analyze the photo can result in rapid, accurate measurements.  Another advantage is that the material can be analyzed without being handled.  This is beneficial in the agricultural industry, as handling of food products can lead to contamination.  Photoanalysis equipment and software is currently being used in mining, forestry and agricultural industries worldwide.Optical counting methodsPSDs can be measured microscopically by sizing against a graticule and counting, but for a statistically valid analysis, millions of particles must be measured.  This is impossibly arduous when done manually, but automated analysis of electron micrographs is now commercially available.  Instruments such as the Retsch Camsizer can perform this analysis on the run using standard camera technology.Electroresistance counting methodsAn example of this is the counter, which measures the momentary changes in the conductivity of a liquid passing through an orifice that take place when individual non-conducting particles pass through.  The particle count is obtained by counting pulses, and the size is dependent on the size of each pulse.Technique Advantages:  Very small sample aliquots can be examined.  Technique Disadvantages:  Sample must be dispersed in a liquid medium... some particles may (partially or fully) dissolve in the medium altering the size distribution.  The results are only related to the projected cross-sectional area that a particle displaces as it passes through an orifice.  This is a physical diameter, not really related to mathematical descriptions of particles (e.g. terminal settling velocity).Sedimentation techniquesThese are based upon study of the terminal velocity acquired by particles suspended in a viscous liquid.  Sedimentation time is longest for the finest particles, so this technique is useful for sizes below 10 m, but sub-micrometer particles cannot be reliably measured due to the effects of motion.  Typical apparatus diperses the sample in liquid, then measures the density of the column at timed intervals.  Other techniques determine the optical density of successive layers using visible light or x-rays.Technique Advantages:  This technique determines particle size as a function of settling velocity.  Technique Disadvantages:  Sample must be dispersed in a liquid medium... some particles may (partially or fully) dissolve in the medium altering the size distribution, requiring careful selection of the dispersion media.Density is highly dependent upon fluid temperature remaining constant.X-Rays will not count carbon (organic) particles.Many of these instruments can require a bulk sample (e.g. two to five grams).Laser diffraction methodsThese depend upon analysis of the halo of diffracted light produced when a laser beam passes through a dispersion of particles in air or in a liquid.  The angle of diffraction increases as particle size decreases, so that this method is particularly good for measuring sizes between 0.1 and 3,000 m.  Advances in sophisticated data processing and automation have allowed this to become the dominant method used in industrial PSD determination.  A particular advantage is that the technique can generate a continuous measurement for analyzing process streams.Acoustic spectroscopy or ultrasound attenuation spectroscopyInstead of light, this method employs ultrasound for collecting information on the particles that are dispersed in fluid.  particles absorb and scatter ultrasound similarly to light. This has been known since Lord Rayleigh developed the first theory of ultrasound scattering and published a book The Theory of Sound in 1878.(Lord Rayleigh, The Theory of Sound, vol.2, Macmillan and Co, NY, second edition, 1896, first edition, 1878.)  There have been hundreds of papers studying ultrasound propagation through fluid particulates in the 20th century.(Dukhin, A.S. and Goetz P.J. Ultrasound for characterizing colloids, Elsevier, 2002) It turns out that instead of measuring scattered energy versus angle, as with light, in the case of ultrasound, measuring the transmitted energy versus frequency is a better choice.  The resulting ultrasound attenuation frequency spectra are the raw data for calculating particle size distribution. It can be measured for any fluid system with no dilution or other sample preparation. This is a big advantage of this method.  Calculation of particle size distribution is based on theoretical models that are well verified for up to 50% by volume of dispersed particles.Air pollution emissions measurementsCascade Impactors  Particulate matter is withdrawn isokinetically from a source and segregated by size in a cascade impactor at the sampling point exhaust conditions of temperature, pressure, etc.  Cascade impactors use the principle of inertial separation to size segregate particle samples from a particle laden gas stream.  The mass of each size fraction is determined gravimetrically.  The California Air Resources Board Method 501(State of California Air Resources Board: Method 501 - Determination of Size Distribution of Particulate Matter from Stationary Sources) is currently the most widely accepted test method for particle size distribution emissions measurements.Mathematical models Probability distributions * The distribution is often used to approximate the particle size distribution of aerosols, aquatic particles and pulverized material.* The distribution or Rosin Rammler distribution is a useful distribution for representing particle size distributions generated by grinding, milling and crushing operations.* The log-hyperbolic distribution was proposed by Bagnold and Barndorff-Nielsen() to model the particle-size distribution of naturally occurring sediments.

Dillingham_Commission
The United States Immigration Commission was a special congressional committee formed in February 1907 by the States Congress, which was then under intense pressure from various nativist groups, to study the origins and consequences of recent to the United States. It was a committee composed of members of both the House and Senate.It is generally known as the Dillingham Commission, after the commissions chair, Senator P. Dillingham of Vermont. The joint commission also included U.S. Senators Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts and Latimer of Carolina (replaced in 1910 by Senator Percy of Mississippi); U.S. Representatives F. Howell, S. Bennet, and L. Burnett; as well as P. Neill of the Department of Labor, Jenks of University, and William R. Wheeler, the California Commissioner of Immigration.The Commission ended its work in 1911, concluding that immigration from southern and Europe posed a serious threat to American society and culture and should be greatly reduced in the future. The Commission proposed the enactment of a reading and writing test as the most feasible single method of restricting undesirable immigration (Commission Recommendations, vol. I, p. 48).The Commissions overall findings provided the rationale for sweeping 1920s reduction acts, including the Quota Act of 1921, which favored immigration from northern and Europe by restricting the annual number of immigrants from any given country to 3 percent of the total number of people from that country living in the United States in 1910.The movement for immigration restriction that the Dillingham Commission helped to stimulate culminated in the Origins Formula, part of the Act of 1924, which capped national immigration at 150,000 annually and completely barred immigration from Asia.Dillingham Commission reportsIn 1911, the Dillingham Commission issued a 41-volume report containing statistical overviews and other analyses of topics related to immigrant occupations, living conditions, education, legislation (at the state as well as the federal level), and social and cultural organizations.  A planned 42nd volume, an index of the other 41 volumes, was never issued.Reports of the Immigration Commission.

Laubach,_Cochem-Zell
Laubach is an Ortsgemeinde  a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality  in the Cochem-Zell district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kaisersesch, whose seat is in the like-named town. Laubach is a state-recognized tourism municipality. Geography  Location The municipality lies in the Eifel roughly 3 km west of Kaisersesch. Its elevation is 550 m above level(Laubachs elevation). Laubach lies on Autobahn A 48 between Koblenz and Trier.NameThe municipalitys name likely has its roots in the High German lbach. Lob and the Modern High German Laub (cognate with the English word leaf(Origin of word leaf with Germanic and other cognates)) here refer to a forest, while ach means a boggy stretch of ground(Laubachs name). History Several finds in the Laubach area give clues to settlers in early times. There is, for instance, a barrow from the Late Age within the municipalitys limits. The Romans, too, left their stone traces.The first undisputed documentary mention of Laubach comes from the year 1455, when court, people and revenue at Laubach were sold to the Counts of Virneburg, a noble family first mentioned in 1024 and enfeoffed by the Archbishop of Trier. Less than a century later, however, in 1548, the of Trier took over the lordly rights.For centuries, the villages main livelihood lay in slate mining. This is documented as far back as 1695, although smaller pits were worked before that. The last slate pit was closed in 1959 after it filled with water.Laubach belonged to the high court district of Masburg, which itself was owned by the Counts of Virneburg, and owed its tithes to Saint Castors Monastery in Karden, even after the Electorate of Trier took over. Suffering came as armies waged war across the land. King Louis XIVs forces overran the area in the Years War (known in Germany as the Pflzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), as did the hordes in the Years War.In 1563, Laubach had 15 hearths (households), but in 1680  32 years after the Thirty Years War had ended  there were only 5 families. By 1874, though, there were 26 houses.Beginning in 1794, Laubach lay under French rule. In 1815 it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the of Vienna.Under Napoleonic hegemony, the lands on the Rhines left bank became French in 1798 and the administration was structured on the French model. Laubach belonged to the Department of Rhin-et-Moselle (or Rhein-Mosel in German) and to the canton and mairie (mayoralty) of Kaisersesch. In 1809, there were 17 souls. Without a doubt, the Rhineland, as part of a greater state, enjoyed advantages such as freedom of trade, before the law  the Code Napolon also applied here  and expansion of the road network.Laubach lay on the Route de deuxime classe Paris-Trier-Koblenz. During the Revolution, French settlers came to Laubach and the surrounding area, whose existence is witnesses by many local surnames, such as Bourgeois (later Germanized to Buschwa), Gorges, Lefev, Regnier and Gilles. French words, too, entered the local speech, some of which can still be heard today. When Europe was newly carved up among the powers of the day at the of Vienna in 1815, the Rhineland became Prussian. Prussian times brought the impoverished Eifel region considerable economic improvements. Healthcare was greatly enhanced, roads, schools and churches were built, there was modest industrialization, and handicrafts flourished, even if the main focus was still on agriculture. By 1832, Laubachs population had risen to 270, and by 1872, it had grown to 345.The War in 1870 and 1871 brought the Eifel region hardship once more. Even worse was the World War. Troops were constantly marching through the countryside, and the school became an army camp. Of Laubachs 224 male inhabitants (figure from 1905), 88 were in the war. Only women and children were left to work the fields, the latter being let off school specially for this.Fifteen of the villages men fell in the Great War; in 1918, ten others were prisoners of war and a further two were in action. The war years were marked by crop failures, hunger and cold. The time after the war was no better.The 1920s brought joblessness, huge prices, neediness and, once more, hunger. National Socialism does not seem to have played much of a rle in Laubach, aside from the odd Nazi henchman, as was so throughout Germany. One of these stalwarts was the local schoolteacher, one of whose entries in the school and village chronicle in 1933 stands out:With the seizure of power by the Fhrer Hitler and the NSDAP, the whole outlook changes. One thing, nonetheless, can be expected to come along with the movement: inwardly, some are its adversaries now just as they were before. They knowingly belong to those whom the Fhrer broadly renounces.The World War claimed 21 men from Laubach. On 1 September 1949, another 11 men were missing in action and 8 were prisoners of war. There once more followed economic hardship. This was eased somewhat by gathering beechnuts in the surrounding woods, as indeed the villagers had already done after the First World War. The beechnuts were delivered to a central place where they were processed for their oil. Four and a half kilogrammes of beechnuts yielded one litre of beechnut oil. The going price for a kilogramme of beechnuts was 2 Marks, and one litre of beechnut oil cost 15 Marks(Laubachs history).Since 1946, Laubach has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The outlying centre of Leienkaul, formerly part of Laubach, became a separate municipality in June 2004. Politics  Municipal council The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The 12 seats on council are shared between two voters groups. In 2004, the election was by majority vote(Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat). Mayor Laubachs mayor is Manfred Adams, and his deputies are Dr. Stefan Gbel and Frank Regnier(Laubachs council). Coat of arms The municipalitys arms might be described thus: Per bend argent a slate bendwise pierced at each corner sable surmounted by a pickaxe of the field, and vert a sheaf of six ears of wheat Or, on a chief of the first six lozenges fesswise conjoined of the second, conjoined with six lozenges fesswise conjoined gules below.

In 1849, he traveled to California to join the rush. Having tried his hand at mining, he and his brother Hubert set up a jewelry shop in Sonora repairing watches and fashioning jewelry. George traveled extensively through the gold rush country chronicling his experiences through watercolors.  George made three trips to Hawaii.  His longest stay was 1855-1856, with shorter visits in 1866 and 1871.(Severson, 2002, p. 76)  Many of Georges Hawaii drawings were later printed by the lithographic firm of Britton & Rey in Francisco.   Georges brothers Charles Burgess and Edward Burgess lived in Honolulu for various periods of time.  Charles was a photographer and portrait painter; Edward ran a coffee shop and sold his brothers artwork.(Severson, 2002, p. 76)     In California, George made a living as a portrait artist, but remains best known for his paintings of the gold rush. He was a founding member of the San Francisco Art Association in 1871 and died in California.

Hausen,_Birkenfeld
Hausen is an Ortsgemeinde  a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality  in the Birkenfeld district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Rhaunen, whose seat is in the like-named municipality.GeographyLocationThe municipality lies in the Hahnenbach valley in the central Hunsrck. Its elevation is 300 m above level.Neighbouring municipalitiesHausen borders in the north on the municipality of Oberkirn, in the east on the municipality of Woppenroth (Rhein-Hunsrck-Kreis), in the south on the municipality of Bundenbach and in the west on the municipality of Rhaunen.HistoryIn 1051, Hausen had its first documentary mention, although the village may be even older, for even then, it had a church. With this church, this village set on top of a cliff terrace overlooking a great bend in the Kyrbach was already earning considerable importance in the Ages as the hub of a great parish, to which, among others, Laufersweiler, Woppenroth, Lindenschied, Oberkirn and Schwerbach belonged. While Laufersweiler split away from the parish quite early on, Woppenroth entered into parochial ties with Dickenschied beginning in 1976, after the 1969 administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate. Within the same framework, Lindenschied had its own parochial ties transferred from Hausen to Dickenschied. Both municipalities thus also switched from the Trier church district to the Simmern-Trarbach church district. The Hausen Evangelical parish now encompasses the villages of Hausen, Oberkirn (which has its own church) and Schwerbach.The church, originally consecrated to Remigius, still has its Romanesque quire tower with its four tapering floors. The aisleless three-sided structure behind it was built on only in 1747 after the mediaeval nave had fallen into disrepair.The historical village centre can be found tightly grouped about the church, but there is a newer centre in the village over on a slope. Running from there from the place where the dale broadens out is a farm lane leading to the outlying farmsteads (Aussiedlerhfe) and then on towards Gsenroth, which follows an old Schmidtburg Ritter- und Pfaffenstrae (knight and parson road  those two social classes were then particularly mobile), which likely was already used in Roman times, and which later served as one of the most important transport links between the castles on the Nahe and the Moselle.Besides agriculture, forestry and mills, of which the Hausener Bauernmhle on the Idarbach can still be seen, slate mining also held great importance right up to the mid 20th century. In the heavily wooded Kaschecktlchen (a small dale) between Hausen and Oberkirn, great waste heaps and various other relics from the Layen quarry can still be seen.PoliticsMunicipal councilThe council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman(Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat).MayorHausens mayor is Gnter Weckmller(Hausens mayor).Coat of armsThe German blazon reads: In gespaltenem Schild vorne in Gold ein blaubewehrter und -gezungter roter Lwe, hinten in Rot ein silbernes Haus mit 2 schwarzen Fenstern und einer Tr.The municipalitys arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per pale Or a lion rampant sinister gules armed and langued azure and gules a house argent masoned sable with two windows and one door of the same.The German blazon does not mention that the lion is supposed to be sinister (that is, facing heraldic left, which is the armsbearers left and viewers right).The lion on the dexter (armsbearers right, viewers left) side is a reference to the villages former allegiance to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves. The house on the sinister (armsbearers left, viewers right) side is a canting charge for the municipalitys name, Hausen, derived from the word Haus (house). This is drawn from Hausens official 18th-century seal, the original stamp for which is at the Landesmuseum Bonn(Description and explanation of Hausens arms).Culture and sightseeingBuildingsThe following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinates Directory of Cultural Monuments:(Directory of Cultural Monuments in Birkenfeld district)* Saint Johns Evangelical Parish Church (Pfarrkirche St. Johann), between Hauptstrae 33 and 35  Romanesque east tower (slated timber-frame floor less old), nave with three-sided structure behind, 1747, Baroque Revival portal porches, 1913; characterizes villages and landscapes appearance* Across from Hauptstrae 26  bakehouse with bare oven under a roof, late 19th century* Hauptstrae 52  house, partly slated timber-frame, half-hipped roof, 19th century* Im Bongert 1  two-leafed house door, echoes of Nouveau, marked 1923Also to be seen locally is the Altburg, an ancient Celtic settlement.

Glasgow_Range
The Glasgow Range is a range on the northern West Coast of Zealands Island.  It is north of the Range and its most significant river is the River. History of settlement The Glasgow Range is largely devoid of settlement, though near the Sea coastline in the foothills are small localities such as Mokihinui and Seddonville.  Upon the discovery of coal, the Branch railway was built into the foothills in the 1890s, but mining activity declined in the 1970s and the railway closed beyond Ngakawau on 3 May 1981.(David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealands Ghost Railways, rev. ed. (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998), 52-3.) Geology and weather Granite soil of poor fertility characterises the Glasgow Range.  The climate is cool, humid, and cloudy.  Rainfall averages 5,600-6,400 millimetres and is largely brought by westerly winds.  Evaporation is low and snow is common during winter.(P. A. Williams, Subalpine and alpine vegetation of granite ranges in western Nelson, New Zealand, New Zealand Journal of Botany  29 1991: 318.)

Alison_Anderson
 Alison Anderson is an Australian politician. She has been a member of the Territory Legislative Assembly since 2005, representing the electorate of MacDonnell, and is a prominent indigenous activist and former and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) Central Zone Commissioner. She was one of the partys candidates at the 2005 election.Anderson was re-elected unopposed as the Member for MacDonnell in the August 2008 Territory election and with the subsequent return of the Henderson Labor Government was appointed to Cabinet.  She has previously held the position of Minister for Natural Resources, Environment and Heritage; Minister for Parks and Wildlife; Minister for Arts and Museums; and Minister for Indigenous Policy. Anderson speaks six indigenous languages, Anmatyerre, Luritja, Pitjantjatjara, Warlpiri, Arrernte and Yankunytjatjara. She is also an accomplished artist.(Jopson, Deborah. Desert Politician At The Centre. Age, 2 August 2003.)Early life and careerAnderson was born in the remote community of Haasts Bluff and was raised in a number of other communities, including Hermannsburg and Papunya. She moved to Alice Springs to attend school, studying at Park School, Springs High School, and St Phillips College. She subsequently received a Diploma of Community Management from the Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education.(Member for MacDonnell: Alison Anderson. nt.alp.org.au. Accessed 26 June 2007.) Returning to Papunya, she was elected Chief Executive Officer of the Community Council in 1985, a role which she fulfilled until handing it over to her husband, Steve Handley, in 2000.(Skelton, Russell. Couples rift exposes years of corruption. Age, 16 October 2005.) She thereby became a prominent representative for the town, then as now one of the countrys most impoverished communities, where basic services failed entirely at times. In this role, Anderson was heavily involved throughout the 1990s in conflicts with successive Liberal Party territory governments over the provision of electricity, education, and health services.(Slattery, Luke. Papunya Blacks Face Winter Without Power. Age, 8 June 1992.)(Alexander, Paul. Aborigine Community a Symbol of Neglect. Press, 14 February 1993.)(Jopson, Deborah. Black Call For Silent Moment. Press, 11 November 1995.)Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander CommissionAnderson was first elected as the ATSIC Commissioner for the Northern Territory Central Zone in November 1999.(Shandley, Jacqueline. New ATSIC boss gives women voice. Advocate, 30 November 1999.) She developed a reputation as an advocate for womens rights within the organisation, and in 2003, was involved in the creation of ATSICs womens advisory board.(Shaw, Meaghan. ATSIC vows to tackle black domestic violence. Age, 27 March 2003.) She became seen as a leading contender for chairperson of the organisation, and in 2002, unsuccessfully challenged veteran leader Clark.(Taylor, Kerry. Whos who on the ATSIC board. Age, 20 June 2001.)(Jopson, Debra. No change at ATSIC top as Clark lays on the charm. Morning Herald, 20 December 2002.) Eight months later, she nominated for the position of deputy chairperson after the resignation of Ray Robinson, but was defeated by one vote despite Robinsons endorsement.(Schubert, Misha and Rintoul, Stuart. Clark ally elected to chair ATSIC. Australian, 19 August 2003.) She supported the federal governments decision to abolish ATSIC in 2004, declaring that reform of the organisation was overdue, but was sharply critical of their decision to replace it with only a consultative committee.(Kirk, Alexandra. ATSIC abolished to silence Indigenous voice: Alison Anderson. ABC Local Radio, 16 April 2004.) She was nevertheless appointed by the federal government as a Central Australian representative to their Round Table on indigenous issues later that year.(Northern Territory parliamentarianIn late 2004, Anderson announced her intention to contest Labor preselection for the seat of MacDonnell, traditionally a safe Labor seat, but then held by two-term CLP member Elferink. She had previously been preselected by the party to stand at the 2001 election, but had withdrawn.(Rivals brace for tussle ahead. Territory News, 11 December 2004.) She subsequently resigned from the ATSIC board, and was confirmed as the Labor candidate in March.(Election shuffle. Territory News, 5 March 2005.) She was widely seen as a candidate during the campaign, due to her high profile in Central Australia, stemming from her work as an ATSIC Commissioner.(Fingers point on both sides. Territory News, 4 June 2005.)(Murdoch, Lindsay. This is Labors Territory, in a landslide. Morning Herald, 20 June 2005.)(Michelmore, Karen. Political tsunami almost wipes out CLP. Coast Bulletin, 20 June 2005.) Her campaign suffered an early blow when her husband was charged with stealing offences in February.(Falconer, Rebecca. Cloud circles Labor hopeful. Territory News, 19 February 2005.) She suffered a further blow when, through April and May, the Springs News and Age aired sweeping allegations of corruption and mismanagement during her husbands administration of Papunya.(Chlanda, Erwin. ALP candidate is in more hot water. Springs News, 27 April 2005.)(Skelton, Russell. In the Centre, a community is seeing red. The Sunday Age, 15 May 2005.) She resisted calls from the opposition to stand aside as the candidate, dismissing the claims as a smear campaign.(Dyer, Paul. Call for candidate to stand down. Territory News, 23 May 2005.)(MLA claims NT smear campaign. Territory News, 5 July 2005.) In spite of the allegations, she was easily elected in June, defeating Elferink with a swing of more than 30%.(Murdoch, Lindsay. NT makes it perfectly Clare. Territory News, 19 June 2005.)The Papunya scandal continued to afflict Anderson in her first months in parliament, as the Commonwealth government launched an investigation into allegations of misuse of government funds by the town administration.(McLean, Greg. Hunt for missing cash. Territory News, 5 July 2005.) This escalated in September, when her now-estranged husband, against whom she had taken out a restraining order, filed a statutory declaration with police alleging that Anderson was responsible for corrupt activities during his administration, and had attempted to bribe elders during her campaign.(Skelton, Russell. Elders bribed for votes in NT. The Sunday Age, 25 September 2005.) She was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing in the police investigation.(Adlam, Nigel. Police probe clears MP of wrongdoing. Territory News, 14 October 2005.) The Commonwealth investigation, while reporting widespread missing funds, did not attribute responsibility for this to Anderson.(Adlam, Nigel. Call to release Papunya report. Territory News, 28 October 2005.) However, allegations of mismanagement persisted in the media for months afterwards.(Skelton, Russell. Footy and a donated music studio - the children of Papunya rise again. Territory News, 27 May 2006.)As her electorate represents much of Central Australia, Anderson has often acted as a spokesperson on issues affecting the communities in the area.(Squires, Nick. Vapourless fuel wins petrol-sniffing war. China Morning Post, 30 March 2005.)(Williams, Kylie and Wright, Shane. Govt confronts indigenous violence again. Australian Associated Press, 25 June 2006.)(Community rises from ashes. Territory News, 4 November 2006.) In May 2007, she risked expulsion from the party by joining McCarthy and Hampton in crossing the floor to vote against a government bill to allow the continuation of mining at the McArthur River Mine, near Borroloola.(Calacouras, Nick. Revolting MLAs cause hole lot of headaches. Territory News, 5 May 2007.)ResignationAnderson resigned from the Labor Party on 4 August 2009, commenting that Im not happy with the way we have conducted ourselves as a government. She also noted her unhappiness that Chief Minister Paul Henderson did not speak out in her defence following an article severely criticising her written by journalist Nigel Adlam in the Territory News.() The resignation comes after Anderson had been very critical of the Northern Territory government about what she considered to be  the inefficient operation of the $672 million Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program.()On 8 September 2011, she joined the Liberal Party, the main opposition party to the Labor Party in the Territory.()References

Auburn_Dam
 extra              Auburn Dam was a proposed dam on the North Fork of the River east of the town of California in the States, on the border of Placer and El Dorado Counties. Slated to be completed in the 1970s by the Bureau of Reclamation, the concrete arch-gravity dam would have been over  high, straddling a gorge downstream of the confluence of the North and Middle Forks of the American River and upstream of Lake. It would have regulated water flow and provided flood control in the American River basin as part of Reclamations immense Valley Project.Proposals and studies for the dam emerged in the late 1960s, and construction work commenced in 1968, involving the diversion of the North Fork American River through a tunnel and the construction of a massive earthen cofferdam. Following a nearby earthquake and the discovery of a fault that underlay the dam site, work on the project was halted for fears that the dams design would not be able to survive a major quake on the same fault zone. Although the dam was redesigned and a new proposal submitted by 1980, spiraling costs and limited water storage offered by either design put an end to the project until heavy floods destroyed the cofferdam, sparking brief renewed interest in the dam. The California State Water Resources Control Board denied water rights for the dam project in 2008 due to lack of implementation.  Although new proposals surfaced from time to time after the 1980s, the dam was never built for a variety of reasons. Limited flood-control capability, geologic instability, and potential harm on recreational and ecological values finally put an end to the Auburn Dam project. Many of the original groundworks and preliminary constructions at the Auburn Dam site still exist, and up to 2007, the North Fork American River still flowed through the diversion tunnel that had been constructed in preparation for the dam. Reclamation and Placer County Water Agency completed a pump station project that year which blocked the tunnel, returned the river to its original channel, and diverted water through another tunnel under Auburn to meet local needs.  However, some groups continue to support construction of the dam, which they claim would provide important water regulation and flood protection.Early historyIn the 1950s, the city of Sacramento was rapidly growing around the confluence of the River and its tributary the River, near the middle of the Central Valley of California. The citys increasing population necessitated the construction of an extensive system of levees on the two rivers to prevent flooding, especially on the American. The flood control works were not enough to keep the rivers within their beds, however; in 1862, the city was inundated so completely that the state government was temporarily moved to Francisco.() In 1956, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Dam on the lower American, near the confluence of its North and South Forks, to provide flood control for the Sacramento metropolitan area.()()() However, the Folsom Dam provided inadequate flood storage, and overflowed on several occasions since its construction.() In fact, a flood in 1955 filled the Folsom Reservoir to capacity, before the dam was even completed.(Smith, p. 29)Water demand in the Central Valley in the Sacramento area was also growing, mainly for agricultural usage. In 1854, a diversion dam was constructed on the North Fork American River at the site of Auburn Dam, to divert water into a series of ditches that supplied irrigation water for downstream farms. Irrigation with dam and canal systems was favored because severe flow fluctuations in Central Valley rivers created floods in some years and droughts in others.(Smith, p. 28) It was in this light that the Auburn Dam was first contrived. As early as the 1950s, plans for a giant dam at the Auburn site were already being considered, in the name of flood control. Several designs, both earthfill and concrete, were considered. Before the dam could be built, however, the Auburn-Foresthill Road, which crossed the river just upstream of the dam site, had to be relocated. Even before the project was authorized, several companies had already taken contracts for the construction of a high bridge to carry the road over the proposed reservoir and preliminary excavations at the dam site.(thumb|left|Map of the extent of the Auburn ReservoirAuburn Dam was to be a massive flood-control and storage structure on the North Fork of the American River, just upstream from Folsom Reservoir. It would create a reservoir with more than twice the capacity of Folsom, which could help reduce floods on the American.(The capacity of Folsom Lake is just under ; Auburn Reservoir would have stored  of water at full pool) With the introduction of the Valley Project in the mid-1930s, came the Auburn-Folsom South Unit, with the purpose to provide new and supplemental water for irrigation, municipal and industrial use, and to replenish severely depleted ground water in the Folsom South region.( In 1965, Congress authorized the Auburn-Folsom South Unit of the Central Valley Project, the primary feature of which was to be Auburn Dam.( The targeted completion date was 1973.()As the proposals for the Auburn Dam evolved, the project saw a transformation from a purely flood-control structure to a multipurpose high dam that would serve various purposes including storage, hydroelectricity generation, and recreational activities. One of the first ideas, publicized in the late 1950s, called for a  embankment dam impounding  of water. In 1963, a  earthfill dam holding back  of water was proposed.( The pre-construction design was finalized in 1967, for a concrete thin-arch gravity structure over  high.( This dam would be  long,  thick at the base, and equipped with five 150MW generators at its base for a total generating capacity of 700 MW. Two concrete-lined flip bucket spillways would abut both sides of the dam. Construction work for the dam started in late 1968.(ConstructionSite preparationthumb|right|Foresthill Bridge, built in anticipation of the rising waters of Auburn ReservoirOfficial groundbreaking of the Auburn Dam started on October 19, 1968 with preparatory excavations and test shafts drilled into the mountainsides of the North Fork American River gorge. The contract for the diversion tunnel through the mountainside on river left,  in diameter,  long, and equipped to handle a flow of  (a roughly 35-year flood) was given to Walsh Western for about $5.1 million in 1968. The actual construction of the tunnel itself did not begin until mid-1971, and the tunnel was completed in late November 1972.() One construction worker was killed during the excavation of the tunnel.( In 1975, the earthen cofferdam for the Auburn project,  high, was completed and water began to flow into the diversion tunnel later that year. The diversion tunnel bypassed a roughly  section of the riverbed for construction of the main dam.Upstream of the dam site, Auburn-Foresthill Road, one of the only all-weather thoroughfares of the region, would have been inundated by the proposed reservoir. In preparation for the reservoirs filling, the road was raised high above the canyon on a three-spanned, -long truss bridge rising  above the river.() Even though the Auburn Dam was never built, the bridge was still required because the pool behind the cofferdam would inundate the old Foresthill crossing anyway, especially during high water.(Smith, pp. 29-30) It also improved safety and reduced travel time by eliminating a steep, narrow and winding grade into the canyon on either side of the river, as comparisons to maps showing the old road alignment will attest. The contracts for various projects pertaining to the relocation of the roadway were given to O.K. Mittry and Sons, Hensel Phelps Construction Company, and Willamette-Western Corporation, the latter for the construction of the actual bridge. The Bridge, which still stands today, was completed in 1973.(Earthquake and redesigningA magnitude 5.7 earthquake shook the Sierra Nevada near Dam in 1975, about  north of the Auburn Dam construction site.() This quake concerned geologists and engineers working on the project so much that the Auburn Dam construction was brought to a complete standstill while the site was resurveyed and investigations conducted into the origins of the earthquake. It was discovered that the quake might have been caused by seismicity, i.e. the weight of the water from Oroville, whose dam had been completed in 1968, was pressing down on the fault zone enough to cause geologic stress, upon which the fault might slip and cause an earthquake.( As the concrete thin-arch design of the Auburn Dam would be vulnerable to such a quake, the project had to be drastically redesigned.() Over the next few years, while all construction was halted, Reclamation conducted evaluations of the seismic potential of the dam site, even though these delays caused the cost of the project to rise with every passing year.() Studies concluded that a major fault system underlay the vicinity of the Auburn Dam site, with many folds of metamorphic rock formed by the contact of the foothills rocks and the granite batholith of the Sierra Nevada.() Reclamation predicted that the Auburn Reservoir could induce an earthquake of up to a 6.5, while the Geologic Survey came out with a higher magnitude of 7.0. Nevertheless, Reclamation redesigned the Auburn Dam based on their 6.5 figure, even though a 7.0 would be three times stronger. The design for the Auburn Dam was changed to a concrete thick-arch gravity dam, to provide better protection against a possible earthquake induced by its own reservoir.(Through the rest of the 1970s, possible designs were looked at but never implemented, while preliminary work on the construction site was resumed. On April 29, 1979, the foundations for the Auburn Dam were completed.( However, debates continued over whether to build a arched or straight-axis dam, the latter of which was proposed because it might be less of an engineering challenge and withstand earthquakes better.(Cofferdam failureIn early 1986 a huge flood began pouring down from the Sierra Nevada mountains. In what would later be considered one of the largest regional floods in recorded history, Placer County was quickly designated a Federal Disaster Area. Rampaging streams and rivers incurred some $7.5 million in damages within the county. Ten inches (254 mm) of rain fell on the Sacramento region in 11 days. Flooding was so catastrophic, that the rating for the citys systems, supposedly designed to prevent a 125-year flood, was dropped to a 78-year flood.() The floods tore out long stretches of levees along the American, Sacramento and Feather Rivers through the Sacramento Valley, and the city of Sacramento was spared by a close margin. Folsom Lake again filled to capacity, and began spilling  by late February.()The flood rapidly filled the pool behind the Auburn cofferdam to capacity, as the diversion tunnel could not handle the extra water pouring into the reservoir. At about 9:00 A.M. on February 18, the rising water overtopped the cofferdam near the right abutment, creating a waterfall that quickly eroded into the structure. Although the cofferdam was designed with a soft earthen plug to fail in a controlled manner if any such event were to occur,() the outflow reached  by noon; several hours later the maximum discharge was reached at , completely inundating the construction site and destroying almost half of the cofferdam.() When the  high cofferdam collapsed, its backed-up water surged downstream into already-spilling Folsom Reservoir less than a mile downstream, deposited the dam debris and raised the lake level suddenly. Folsom Dam outflow exceeded the design capacity of levees downstream from re-regulating Nimbus Dam downstream from Folsom, but the levees were not overtopped and severe flooding was avoided through Sacramento.(Smith, pp. 36-40) The flood events spurred renewed interest in the Auburn Dam, since a permanent dam would have helped Folsom Dam store water without the flood from behind the cofferdam, but it became clear that the system of levees, dams and diversions on the American River needed to be re-engineered.()Stopping the projectEconomic costIn the years following the 1980-era floods, some public opinion turned against the Auburn Dam because of its relatively small reservoir capacity related to its size, and the massive estimated cost to finish the project, which was then already rising into the billions of dollars. The best dam sites require a relatively small dam that can store massive amounts of water, and most of those sites in the U.S. have already been taken. A comparison with Dam, for example, reveals that the Auburn would store very little water compared to its structural size. Mead, the reservoir behind Hoover, stores about  of water. The proposed Auburn Reservoir, with a mere 8% of that capacity, would require the construction of a dam not only as tall as Hoover but over three times as wide.( As early as 1980, the cost of building the Auburn Dam was estimated at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the dam would be about $10 billion.() Other flood-control works to raise the height and improve the spillway capacity of Folsom Dam, and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, would cost significantly less while providing protection against the same floods. Also, the States National Research Council believes that existing flood records, which have been in place less than 200 years, are insuffient to justify the construction of a dam as large as Auburn.() Finally, water from Auburn Dam, if connected to the long-unfinished Folsom South Canal as originally planned by Reclamation, would be costly and in unreliable supply as the annual inflows to the reservoir would be a relatively modest  or , even though the river poses a high flood threat.()Failure riskthumb|left|Map of the area around the confluence of the Sacramento and American Rivers that would be inundated if Auburn Dam were to failDue to the seismically active nature of the area, the Auburn Dam would also be at risk for failure from an earthquake, even one that the weight of its reservoir might induce on one of the fault lines that crosses the area, known as the Bear Mountain fault zone.() Surface displacement of the ground might range from a few inches/centimeters to  in each direction. Although a new concrete-gravity design by Reclamation was tested to survive a magnitude 6.5 earthquake, it performed poorly under the 7.0 that the USGS had originally estimated.(A Bureau of Reclamation study released in 1980 proved that a failure of Auburn Dam would result in a giant wave reaching Folsom Lake within five minutes, and most likely would cause a cascading failure of Folsom and Dams downstream as well within an hour, unleashing millions of acre-feet of water which would cause far greater damage downstream than any possible natural flood. Folsom would collapse or at least get severely overtopped; Nimbus Dam would be overtopped by  of water; and the State Capitol would be under  of water, as would be much of the rest of the Sacramento metropolitan area. In 1975, a study predicted that a failure of Folsom Dam alone would result in over 250,000 fatalities.( With Auburn Dams capacity added in, the resulting flood would be over three times larger, and cause even greater damage, inundating land for miles on either side of the American and Sacramento rivers.()FateFilling of the Auburn Reservoir would result in a two-pronged,  lake which would inundate numerous canyons and rapids of the North Fork and Middle Fork of the American River. In 1981, the American River was acknowledged as the most popular recreational river in California.( Over one million people visit the canyons of the North and Middle Forks of the American River each year to engage in various recreational activities not least of which include kayaking, rafting, hiking, hunting, biking, horseback riding, gold mining, off-roading, and climbing. 900,000 of these visitors go to the State Recreation Area, which surrounds the former dam site.() The reservoir would inundate this popular recreational haven, and cause the silting and destruction of riverbeds and rapids in the canyons. Trails, including those for the Cup and States Endurance Run, would be among the ones submerged.() The Auburn Reservoir would also result in the destruction of thousands of acres of riverine habitat,( and the inundation of historic and archaeological sites.()In the end, the Auburn Dam project, once referred to as the dam that wouldnt die() and with more lives than an alley cat,() was defeated by the intervention of environmentalists, conservationists, and cost-conscious economists. Although four bills to revive the dam project were introduced in Congress over the next twenty years, all were turned down.( Representative Norman D. Shumway introduced the Auburn Dam Revival Act of 1987, which was rejected because of the phenomenally high costs. A flood control bill in 1988 involving the Auburn Dam was also defeated.(Smith. p. 152) In 1992 and 1996, plans for restarting the Auburn project appeared in various water projects bills. However, even though the project was now leaning towards purely flood-control instead of the original expensive multipurpose that environmental groups had opposed, both were denied.(Smith, p. 153) As the years dragged on, the cost of the project grew, and it officially ended with the revoking of USBR water rights to the site by the state on November 11, 2008.(Proposals for resurrecting the Auburn DamAuburn Dam is the public works equivalent of a Hollywood zombie, rivaling any Tinseltown creation in its ability to withstand repeated attempts to kill it. First proposed nearly a half-century ago for a site in the American River canyon near the Gold Rush town of Auburn, the dam has withstood attacks by U.S. presidents, member of Congress, state and federal agencies, environmentalists, tax watchdogs, scientists, engineers and even nature itself  the political equivalent of being shot, stabbed, drowned, poisoned, electrocuted and set on fire. --Renewed Flood Sensitivity Reactivates Auburn Dam  California Planning and Development Report, August 8, 2006() In part as an alternative to Auburn Dam project, flood control for the lower American River is being improved through the $1 billion Joint Federal Project (a collaboration of the US Bureau of Reclamation and the US Army Corps of Engineers) at Folsom Dam which adds a new lower spillway and strengthens the eight dikes that serve as part of the dam.  Additional work proposed includes a possible raise of Folsom Dam several feet to improve its flood control and storage capacity.  Key levees downstream have also been improved for flood control in the Sacramento area by the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency.  Sugar Pine Reservoir, an auxilliary component of the Auburn-Folsom South Project upstream in the watershed, was transferred in title by the Bureau of Reclamation to Foresthill Public Utility District in 2003. As a result of a court decision in 1990 (Hodge Decision), the uses of Reclamations Folsom South Canal changed further when the Freeport Project came online in 2011 to redivert water supplies for East Bay Municipal Utility District and Sacramento County Water Agency from the Sacramento River instead of from the canal via the lower American River, thereby reducing the need for additional supplies from Auburn Dam to the American River.  Anticipated diversions from the Folsom South Canal had previously been reduced when the Sacramento Municipal Utility District decommissioned its Rancho Seco nuclear facility in 1989 and no longer required large quantities of cooling water from the canal.  Although the Auburn Dam is now mostly considered history, there are still proponents and groups devoted to restarting the long-inactive project. Advocates argue that the construction of Auburn would be the only solution for providing much-needed flood protection to the Sacramento area; that millions of dollars have already been spent making preparations; that it would provide an abundant supply of reliable water and hydroelectricity; and also that the recreational areas lost under the reservoir could be rebuilt around it.() A major supporter of the revival of the dam is the Sacramento County Taxpayers League; a recent survey revealed that up to two-thirds of Sacramento citizens support construction of the Auburn. They also argue that the dam would only cost $2.6 billion instead of $610 billion, and that it is the cheapest alternative to provide flood control for the American River.()Area Congressman Doolittle was one of the largest proponents of the Auburn Dam, and he appropriated several million dollars for funds to conduct feasibility studies for the dam. About $3 million went into the main feasibility report, and the remaining $1 million was used for a study concerning the relocation of State Route 49, which runs through the site.() After the Katrina disaster in 2005, Doolittle drew public attention to the flood vulnerability of the Sacramento region. He also used the flood-protection incompetence of the Folsom Dam to his advantage, saying that without an Auburn Dam we could soon be in the unenviable position of suffering from both severe drought and severe flooding in the very same year.( He led all 18 Republican members of the House of Representatives in a protest in 2008, trying to convince Governor Schwarzenegger to revoke the water-rights decision that California had made against Reclamation.() Doolittle is sometimes known as the Auburn Dams chief sponsor.()In response to public outcry, most pro-Auburn Dam groups now recommend the construction of a dry dam, or one that purely supports the purpose of flood control. Such a dam would stand empty most of the year, but during a flood the excess flow would pool temporarily behind the dam instead of flowing straight through, and therefore the dam could still provide flood control while leaving the American River canyons dry for most of the year (hence dry). Water would be impounded for only a few days or weeks each year instead of all year long, minimizing damage on the local environment. The dam would be built to protect against a 500-year flood.() Also, with the construction of a dry Auburn Dam, Folsom Lake could be kept at a higher level throughout the year because of reduced flood-control pressure, therefore facilitating recreational access to the reservoir. Finally, regulations in flow could help recharge efforts; the lower Sacramento Valley aquifer is acknowledged as severely depleted.()Legacythumb|right|Part of the North Fork American River valley, which would have been submerged if the Auburn Dam had been constructedSince its inception, hundreds of millions of dollars have been poured into the Auburn Dam project,( but no further work has been done since the 1980s.( However, the Bureau of Reclamation continues to list the Auburn as a considered alternative for the future of its Auburn-Folsom South Unit project.( As of now, massive evidence of the dams construction still remain in the North Fork American River canyon, specifically the excavations for the abutments and spillway, with the consequences of increased erosion.() In recent decades, California has been struck with a severe series of droughts. In order to facilitate continued deliveries of water to the thirsty southern half of the state, the Central Valley and Water Projects have been forced to cut water supplies for agriculture in much of the Joaquin Valley.() Annual deficits of water in the state are projected to rise from  in 1998 to an estimated  by 2025. The state has proposed three or four solutions to the shortfall. One, the Peripheral Canal, would facilitate water flow from the water-rich north to the dry south, but has never been built due to environmental concerns. The raising of Dam on the Sacramento or Melones Dam on the Stanislaus, or the building of Sites Reservoir,() has also been proposed.() Lastly, the Auburn Dam has also been revived in light of this. According to supporters, it would cause the least environmental destruction of the multitude of choices, and would give the most reliable water yield, regardless of its skyrocketing costs.()A pumping station to supply water to the Placer County Water Agency was built in 2006 on the Middle Fork American River, supplying  to a northwest-running pipeline. The capacity of the station is eventually expected to be upgraded to .() By 2006, the Bureau of Reclamation itself began to restore the dam site, which then had been untouched for more than a decade. The river diversion tunnel was sealed but not filled in, and the remnants of the construction site in the riverbed as well as the remains of the cofferdam excavated out of the canyon. After the riverbed was leveled and graded, an artificial riverbed with manmade Class III rapids was constructed to channel the river through the site. The restoration project also included the construction of other recreational amenities in the Auburn site. This act was seen as the final step of decommissioning the Auburn project and shelving it forever.(()ReferencesWorks cited*External links*Auburn Dam Council*Sacramento County Taxpayers League  Auburn Dam*Auburn Dam Watch

Mark_Maryboy
footnotes     Mark Maryboy (born December 10, 1955) was an American politician for San Juan County, Utah, and a former Nation Council Delegate for the Utah Navajo Section of the Navajo Tribe. He is the brother of Maryboy who currently serves in the positions he once stood. Mark is of the Navajo Indian Tribe.Mark Maryboy was also the Juan County, Utah Commissioner for District Three who saw to the needs of the countys residents and the Utah Navajo Element. He made history when he was elected in 1986 as the first American Indian county commissioner in Utahs history.M. Benally along with the former Navajo Nation Council Delegate Mark Maryboy and protesters from the Aneth Chapter Blocked the main ExxonMobil corporate office for three days in Aneth, Utah. Life and education Maryboy was born on December 10, 1955 at St. Christophers mission near Utah. He was the fifth of eight children, all of whom were raised in a Navajo hogan.Mark attended BIA boarding schools in Kayenta and Aneth at varied times, even though it was hard for him to be separated from his parents during those periods. Government schools were difficult for him as there seemed to be a deliberate attempt to destroy the Indian person that he was. Angry and resentful because of harsh treatment, he ran away from boarding school while in third grade. His parents then enrolled him and his beloved brother, Herbert, in the public school at Bluff. They were the first reservation Navajo students to attend public school in San Juan County. Upon graduation from San Juan High School in Utah he attended the of Utah, majoring in history with a minor in business. He garnered a B.A. degree in 1978.  Political representative thumb|left|145px|Mark Maryboy at a Campaign rallySome time after graduation, he returned to the Navajo Reservation to put his talents to work to help his people. Working as the Director of Education for the Utah Navajo Development Council, he supervised Headstart, Adult Education, and vocational education programs. He created teacher training programs and a special class for teen mothers. Not alone in his endeavors, he married the engaging Rosylyn Johnson, who is also a graduate of the University of Utah and a State of Utah Social Worker on the reservation. They have one daughter who currently is attending a higher learning academy. San Juan County Commissioner Image:Map of Utah highlighting San Juan County.svg|thumb|right|145px|San Juan County which includes the Utah section of the Nation near its southern Stateline with Arizona.One hundred and thirty years after Native Americans were pushed to isolated reservations, the Navajo people of Utah reclaimed a place in the American political process. In 1986, Maryboy, then age 31 and politically ambitious, ran for San Juan Commissioner. This was the first election after the county was divided by Justice Department decree into commissioner districts. He was elected a San Juan County Commissioner and became the first Native American to hold such a position in the state of Utah. An elected official, he realized even greater inequities in services given to his Navajo constituents. The Navajo people were bringing in more money for the county than they were receiving back in services. He mixed it up with the other commissioners, often battling the always capable right-wing former Commissioner Calvin Black, the undisputed kingpin of San Juan County politics, during hotly contested commission meetings. He spoke out quietly but effectively to point out the injustices of it all.Maryboys four terms on the San Juan County Commission - particularly the first half-dozen years - were the subject of much press and the stuff of legend-making. His sword-crossing with the late commission chairman, Cal Black, spiked tensions across southern Utah as Maryboy fought for funding for roads, sanitation and water for Utahs Navajos.In 1989 Navajo elders and other Democratic stalwarts determined to run a Navajo for every county post up for election. 56 percent of San Juans population was Navajo at the time.  The campaign aimed at getting tribal members to the polls was called Niha-Whol-Zhiizh, meaning Its our turn. The Democratic-Navajo plan fizzled. Maryboy won a second commission term, but was the only Navajo Indian elected. Navajo Nation Council Delegate In November 1990, he was elected to the Nation Council as a council delegate from the Aneth area. He sat on the Advisory Board of the College of Social & Behavioral Science at the University of Utah. He is currently the chairman of the Navajo Nation Council Budget & Finance Committee. Maryboy met President Clinton in 1992 at the Democratic National Convention at Madison Square Garden. Maryboy delivered a prayer in Navajo at one of the sessions. He was a delegate to the Nations Conference for Indigenous peoples in Switzerland in July 1992. He was appointed to serve on the Utah Advisory Committee for the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 1993. He was appointed by President Clinton to serve on the Advisory Council on Indian Education in 1994.Navajo Tribal Council AssaultIn April 2006, Nation Council Speaker T. Morgan faced a charge of criminal battery when he struck Council Delegate Mark.Navajo Council Speaker Morgan struck Maryboy in the chest after Maryboy made a complaint to the speaker that he didnt help Maryboy bring up legislation that had been skipped over earlier that day.The itemformal condolences to the family of late Council Delegate Curley John of Aneth, whose family was in the gallerywas skipped because Maryboy was out of the Council Chambers dealing with Constituents.Maryboy tried later to put the item back on the agenda but was ruled out of order, the paper reportedAneth Chapter members had demanded Morgan issue a public apology, following the bathroom scuffle, during one of Aneths monthly chapter meetings in Utah.  Speaker Morgan ignored the Aneth meeting, overall never presenting himself. Utah Navajo Commission The Utah Navajo Commission manages revenues derived from mineral development on the Utah portion of the reservation for the Utah Navajos. The population of Utah Dine is nearing 10,000 enrolled members. Mark Maryboy serves with this entity as well seeing to the deployment of monetary funds and the Navajo energy issues in San Juan County.  Navajo water rights issue In 2002 he and the Utah Navajo Commission urged the Nation to reassert River water claims the tribe waived in the late 1960s to help facilitate a power plant near Arizona.In a resolution to the Navajo Nation Council this week, the Utah Navajo also urged the Navajo tribes water attorney be fired and the tribe create an independent water commission to reform the tribes water policyAccording to the Utah Navajo Commission, the tribe could claim between one and two million acre feet (2.5 km) of Colorado River water, which potentially could be worth billions of dollars.Mark always felt that it was long past time for the Navajo Nation to take aggressive and comprehensive action on the tribes dormant water rights.The council waived at least a portion of its rights in a 1968 agreement with the federal government and the Salt River Project, which planned to build a coal-fired power plant near Page.In that deal, the council agreed not to demand more than  of Colorado River water so that  could be diverted to the plant. Utah Navajo Oil Image:Oil well.jpg|thumb|left|150px|PumpjackIn 1933, Congress created the Utah Navajo Trust Fund. It is unique in that the state was deemed the trustee-delegate for oil pumped from Navajo land. According to the law, 37.5 percent of royalties are supposed to go to Utah Navajos. But a 1991 report from the state found gross mismanagement. Some people were later indicted for misusing the trust fundNavajos living in nearby San Juan County in southeastern Utah have long protested the saturation of oil and gas wells around their homes. Mark and other Utah Navajos have long argued that the Navajo Nation returns little profit to Navajos living in desperate conditions in the Utah portion of tribal land. Utah Navajo allegations of corruption within the U.S. Interior gained support from an Interior whistleblower in 2003.Aneth Oil CrisisIn 1997, local residents began the Aneth Oil Protest against Exxon-Mobils Utah Navajo community policies. Protesters from the Aneth Chapter blocked the main ExxonMobil Corp. Office for 3 days at the McElmo Oil Plant near Aneth, Utah.From the start, the protest was made up of local Navajo people who were becoming increasingly angry at Exxon-Mobils stance towards the environment and its hiring practices within the local communities. Many other national political activist organizations such as the Indian Movement wanted to get involved with the protest. However, it was agreed to not include outside affiliates, which might result in losing the original meaning and message of the protest http://www.hcn.org/servlets/hcn.Article?article_id3102 .Former Navajo Nation president Hale was also mobilized to the northernmost corner of the Navajo Nation where the protest was initiated. Mark, along with members of the Aneth Community, helped create a new standard for the Navajo workers working in the Aneth Oil area as well as the hiring process. Life after politics Heeding to his fathers wishes, he did not seek a fifth term on the council. Maryboy established Utah Navajo Health Systems in 1999 along with Donna Singer. Then he ramrodded tribal legislation that allows the agency to keep its profits, rather than return them to Window Rock. This remains a legacy for the policies Maryboy left.Utah Navajo Oil RevenuesRecently Counsel Delegates Kenneth Maryboy, Davis Filfred, and Former Counsel Delegate Mark Maryboy have been actively working to ensure that the Aneth Oil Royalties stay with the Utah Navajo people.However such causes are not without competition, the Navajo Nation itself has been working counter to the Utah Navajo people in taking over the Aneth Oil Revenues. It presents a significant problem with a line of issues Kenneth is up against.On June 16, 2008, Kenneth Maryboy, Mark Maryboy, Davis Filfred, and the honorable Phil Lyman of Utah will travel to D.C. to present a working model of how an easy transition from the State of Utah handling Utah Navajo royalty money, to a functioning Utah Navajo organization before Congress.See also* is Empowering Project* Walk of the Navajo* Dinetah* language* music* people* Athabaskan languages* Court of the Navajo Nation* mining in the United States External links *San Juan County Website*Bridging Two Worlds*THE POLITICAL MARK MARYBOY*Navajos blocked Mobil Oil Corp. offices near Aneth, Utah January 1997*Mobil Settles Aneth Oil Spills Case*Navajos in Utah fight state over trust mismanagement*Oil and gas drilling leases increase for sacred lands *Salt Lake Tribune Public Lands directors departure pleases environmentalists, some Navajos*Aneth Oil Field*Navajos say Utah cheated their tribe*Speaker Morgan accused of battery against council delegate Maryboy*Utah Democratic Party

Critical_Path_(book)
Critical Path is a book written by US author and inventor Buckminster Fuller with the assistance of Kuromiya. First published in 1981, it is alongside Manual for Spaceship Earth one of Fullers best-known works. Vast in its scope, it describes Fullers own vision of the development of human civilization, history, and his highly original ideology based, amongst other things, on his detailed description of why scarcity of resources need no longer be a decisive factor in politics.  Overview The following is a list of the main claims and opinions presented in the book, reported without discussion or criticism. Part One The first part of the book explains the history and present state of the global economy. Chapter 1 - Speculative Prehistory of Humanity life began in the atolls of the South Pacific, where the average sea temperature is closest to that of the human body (p.6). Rather than evolving from simpler organisms, humanity was of extraterrestrial origin and other organisms evolved from us (p.7). From this base, humanity developed boat-building in Asia and colonised the rest of the planet (p.15). There is evidence that the Age began in Southeast Asia (p.17). Fullers Dymaxion World Map is used to show the distribution of humanity over the Earths surface. Over half the population lives in the regions watered by the Himalayan glaciers (p.20). Chapter 2 - Humans in Universe Our knowledge of the spherical shape of the Earth is central to our understanding of ecology (p.34). This knowledge probably originated in prehistoric times, was certainly known to the Greeks, but was then suppressed for centuries by organised religion because it was incompatible with the official story of a Heaven above and a Hell below (p.43). There has been an evolution of religious ideas from those of the Egyptian pyramid-builders, whose ambition was to deliver a single individual, the pharaoh, into the afterlife, to the modern belief that everybody has a right to enjoy life on Earth (p.51). Chapter 3 - Legally Piggily Human history has been shaped by the continual growth and success of greed. City-states were the first institutions to make organised use of extortion (p.68). This was then followed by the growth of trade, which appropriates the wealth of the planet for its own ends. Corruption in the form of lawyer-capitalism has led the U.S.A. to become effectively bankrupt (p.114). Government subsidies given to corporations amount to socialism (p.101). Chapter 4 - Self-Disciplines of Buckminster Fuller Fullers diary, the Chronofile, is intended to show how much a single human being with little money can do to influence world affairs (p.128). The mechanical principle of precession is used as a metaphor for the ability of a person to influence the world by applying pressure in an unconventional direction (p.144). Fullers religious beliefs are explained (p.151). Chapter 5 - The Geoscope The Geoscope is a large-scale, animated globe of the Earth intended to help people visualise the spatial and temporal patterns of human activity, either in real time or replayed at different speeds. If the human mind is presented with all of this information at once, it should be able to use its visual pattern-detecting abilities to solve complex problems such as weather-forecasting, resource conflicts, and wars (p.183). Data for the Geoscope can come from the world maps produced by the USA, using radio triangulation, during and after World War II (p.184). Geodesic domes will be built to enclose entire cities (p.179). Afghanistan was the heartland of the War world, as it gave the USSR the potential of a route through Iran to the Ocean (p.194). Chapter 6 - World Game The Game is a simulation of global economic activity. Computers can be used to calculate the optimal answer to any economic, technological or social question. The computers will tell us that the true cost to the environment of using fossil fuels is prohibitive, and renewable energy should be used instead. The true energy cost of a gallon of gasoline is more than one million (1980) US dollars. The amount of scrap metals in circulation means that no more mining is necessary (p.205). A global electrical supply grid will enable more efficient use of energy, and make intermittent renewable energy more practical (p.202). Part Two This part of the book explains Fullers plan to set humanity on the path to a sustainable existence with no need to fight over resources. Chapter 7 - Critical Path: Part One Education is key to improving humanitys living conditions (p.232). The USSR tried to destabilise the US education system by inciting its students to riot (p.236). The Project had a path of two million tasks, one million of which required new technological solutions (p.248). Fuller has applied a similar project-planning approach to the saving of humanity, and has created a list of critical-path items (p.248). Chapter 8 - Critical Path: Part Two Unlike the Apollo Project, the critical-path items in the project to save humanity can all be accomplished with existing technologies (p.253). A global video education system must be developed (p.265). Chapter 9 - Critical Path: Part Three Corn is wasted in generating unnecessarily fatty but more profitable beef (p.272). In Los Angeles, private-incerator and later car-pollution laws were passed to shift the blame for smog from industry to citizens (p.279). In 1929 the USSR used its gold wealth relative to the USAs poverty to pay USA industry to set up industries in USSR, in USSRs first three 5-year plans (p.289). Chapter 10 - Critical Path: Part Four The first task in humanitys critical path is to build a global electricity grid (p.309). The second task is to provide movable dwellings for all - city-sized and family-sized domes (p.310). Fuller has the following designs ready for production: the Flys Eye dome (p.311); Man Rivers City project, St. Louis (p.315); Raleigh cotton mill (p.325); Growth House - sustainable greenhouse (p.329); O-Volving shelves (p.331); tetrahedral floating city (p.333); Cloud Nines - spherical floating cities (p.336); 8,000-foot Tokyo Tower (p.338); containerised passenger air travel (p.340). Appendices * Appendix I - Chronology of Scientific Discoveries and Artifacts* Appendix II - Chronological Inventory of Prominent Scientific, Technological, Economic, and Political World Events: 1895 to Date Concepts * path. The title of the book is a term used in planning. To estimate the completion date of a project, a chart is drawn showing all of the necessary sub-tasks and their durations, placed in chronological order. The last task cannot begin until all of tasks on which it depends have been completed. These tasks depend, in turn, on other tasks. It is usually possible to draw numerous paths through the chart from beginning to end, but it is the longest path, called the critical path, that determines the time that the project will take to complete. The book refers frequently to the Project, which was planned using this method. Fullers plan to reorganise the global economy in a sustainable way also has a critical path, which is identified in the book.* Earth. The Earths material resources, like those of a spaceship, are finite. The book explains that early humans did not understand this, because the Earth seemed like a boundless flat surface. We now know that the Earth is a sphere, and this fact should inform all of our decisions.* Personal integrity. Critical Path is part manifesto, part autobiography. Fuller admits in one place that this is egostistical (p.378), but excuses this by saying that he wants to show not just his conclusions, but also the thought processes that led to them. He believes that every person must think for himself and take as little as possible on trust (p.xi).

Bayview,_Alabama
Bayview is a community in Alabama, States.  The community is built around Bayview Lake.  It is part of the Combined Statistical Area.  Bayview voted to be annexed by its nearest town of Mulga.  However, Bayview today retains its own community identity.  History It was developed as a town by the Coal, Iron and Railroad Co. (TCI) for workers employed at the Mulga coal mine and their families.  It was a model community when it was created and it received an award at the York Worlds Fair.  The community included a commissary for shopping, doctors office, schools, community center/library, churches, and parks.  Public bus service was available to other communities in the county.  This community typically consisted of two-, three-, four-, and five-room houses that were owned by TCI and rented to the workers.  The rent was USD $2.00 per room per month for the TCI employees living in the homes.  Later TCI eliminated the rental program and sold the homes to the workers.  TCI was later purchased by Steel corporation.The Mulga mine flooded and was eventually closed.  Some residents in the community then worked at the nearby Edgewater mine.  Today, residents in Bayview work for businesses across the county and are not exclusively associated with the mining industry.

Wine_Harbour,_Nova_Scotia
Wine Harbour is a community located in Guyborough County along the Eastern Shore of Scotia.Natural settingWine Harbour is a rural area located on the east side of the harbour of the same name on the eastern shore of Scotia. This shore is studded with bays and inlets. ClimateThe presence of the Ocean gives the area a semi-maritime climate with a delay of seasons as compared with inland areas; however, frequent offshore winds bring continental-type weather with winter cold and summer heat. In late summer and fall, the area can be threatened by hurricanes or their extratropical remnants. Geology, Soils and VegetationThe bedrock is quartzite, which is almost entirely dioxide with little more than trace amounts of nutrient-bearing minerals; consequently, the soils are infertile. They are also so stony as to be non-arable. The dominant soil, a Gleyed Humo-Ferric Podzol under the system of soil classification, is mapped as the Danesville Series. Somewhat stunted but well-exploited forests of spruce, spruce, tamarack and fir alternate with treeless barrens and bogs. plants and sundews are abundant in the bogs. The introduced poplar is escaping from cultivation. Many other exotic plant species remain confined to residents gardens, often in raised beds or even discarded automobile tires to avoid the stones. Seaweed, available at local beaches, is a very popular compost material.HistoryA Portuguese vessel loaded with wine was wrecked here. Its cargo flowed into the harbour, establishing the name. The Indian name was Pebumkeegunech which when translated to English means fish spawning place or an outlet cut through the sand. In 1818, one family consisting of five persons settled here and cleared . This was probably the family of Walters, a native of Carolina and a veteran of the Revolutionary War who settled in Nova Scotia around 1811 or 1812.By 1862, Wine Harbour was thriving rapidly. The main reason for its vigorous growth was the discovery of gold in July 1861 by Doody and Smith, Sr. which was the beginning of a great gold boom which lasted until 1905. The first crusher used was called the Crusher and it was run by water power. The procedure began when the rocks were hoisted out of the ground by horses, put on wooden scowls and brought across the harbour, if the wind was favorable, to the Victoria Crusher which was on the then Cooper property. The surveyor for the mining company at this time was W. Crockett. At the peak of this gold boom there were ten crushers run by steam power using coal, which was brought from vessels from Sydney. Because of the gold mine, Wine Harbour was one of the first settlements in County to have electricity.After 1905 the gold mining industry lay desolate until 1936 when C. Irving supervised the opening of the once prosperous gold mines. It died the following year and Wine Harbour lost its once booming industry forever. At the time of the gold mining industry Wine Harbour was also growing in other aspects. Thomas Lucas had a hotel and store and the Irwin family had a number of general stores throughout the area. A lobster factory was located in the area whose foreman was John Ballantyne and a blacksmith shop and a bank were also in the area. Postmaster at this time was John Gilles. St. Patricks Mission Church was built in 1857 to replace a larger church that had been destroyed by a hurricane. A Union Church was dedicated to Baptists, Anglicans and Presbyterians in 1897, and is no longer in existence. St. Patricks Mission Church has been vacant since 1955. * The first schoolhouse was built in 1869 and 85 pupils were registered at this time. Before this it was believed that the original Catholic Church was used during the week as a schoolroom for the children.After 1905, limited farming, fishing and logging were the main industries and the 1956 population decreased to 50. Today the population of the community is about 25. Wine Harbour has lost its gold mines, its factories, most of its fishing, many of its forests, a church and the majority of its people. Its history will remain.References* History of Wine HarbourJ.D. Hilchey, D.B. Cann, and J.I. MacDougall, 1964. Soil Survey of Guysborough County, Nova Scotia. Report No. 14, Nova Scotia Soil Survey.

Montana_Mountain
 easiest_route  Montana Mountain is a deeply eroded Cretaceous stratovolcano located south of Yukon, Canada. As well as its main peak, the mountain includes many sub-peaks and contains felsic pyroclastics and flows;(Jurassic to Cretaceous volcanics Retrieved on 2007-07-04) typically altered and orange-weathering. Montana Mountain was formed when the ancient Plate was subducting under southwestern Yukon during the Late Cretaceous period.A flurry of quartz mining activity took place on Montana Mountain in the early 1900s.  American financier John Conrad consolidated claims on Montana Mountain(Yukon News, January 17, 1997) and built a tramway from Windy Arm on Tagish Lake 4 miles up the mountain to carry the ore back down.(The Yukon Territory: Its History and Resources (Minister of the Interior, Ottawa, 1907))Montana mountain is also an important landmark for the Tagish and Carcross First Nations living in the area.  According to legend, Montana Mountain is one of the peaks Game Mother used to hang a swing for her animal creations.  On this swing each kind of animal danced and sang a different song.  Following this celebration Game Mother gave each animal their characteristic attributes of today.(Carcross Tagish First Nation Parks and Recreation Branch Pamphlet)  In addition to its spiritual importance, the mountain was also an important source of food, medicines, and refuge.During the Klondike Gold Rush, an extensive network of trails were constructed on the mountain to connect the silver rich Pooley Canyon with Tagish Lake.  In 2005 the Carcross/Tagish First Nation took back the mountain in its land claim settlement and set out to restore the old trail network and make it accessible for public use and enjoyment.(Carcross Tagish First National Parks and Recreation Branch Pamphlet)Through a programme called SingleTrack to Success an extensive network of mountain bike trails have been developed on the lower slopes of Montana Mountain.  Maps are available online as well as in Carcross and in Whitehorse.See also*of Northern Canada*of volcanoes of CanadaReferencesExternal links* Montana Mountain in the Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia* http://www.ctfn.ca/tiki-page.php?pageNameHome Tagish Carcross First Nation Community Portal

Luis_Maria_Baca_Grant_No._4
The Luis Maria Baca Grant No. 4, south of Colorado, was a large land grant made in 1860 by the United States to the heirs of the original Vegas Grandes Grant at Vegas, New Mexico.(http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID409757 Definition, States Code)() Title to the grant at Las Vegas was clouded by a second grant of the same land.( The Baca heirs were offered alternative lands from the public lands of the United States.( The largest of the tracts selected, near what is now Crestone,( was  on a side and was located to the south of what is now County Road T, about  south of the 38th parallel. The Bacas deeded the land to their attorney, but it soon passed by tax sale to a third party. The ranch headquarters was on Creek to the southwest of Crestone. The Baca Grant was one of the first large tracts of land to be fenced in the West and in its heyday was the home of prize Hereford cattle.(Masters thesis by Ms Cox regarding the history of the Baca Grant. This document, now lost, was in the library of Adams State College.)In addition to ranching there was some mining in the area to the east and south of Crestone, some on the lands of the grant, but no big strikes. In 1880 the town of Crestone was platted by George Adams, the owner of the Baca Grant. In 1900, with the help of Eastern investors, George Adams ignited a minor boom, reopening one of the more promising mines and building a railroad spur to the town and the mines along the de Cristo Range south of town. However, lacking good ore, the boom was short-lived. A long period of decline followed.thumb|right|300px|View from the northwestern corner of the original grantBy 1948 Crestone had declined to its post-war population of 40 souls, mostly retired folks and cowboys who worked on The Grant, as the Baca Grant was called locally. In 1971 a portion of the Baca Grant, under the corporate ownership of the Arizona-Colorado Land and Cattle Company, immediately south of Crestone, was subdivided, creating the Baca Grande, a subdivision originally platted for about 10,000 lots. At great expense, underground utilities were installed and roads built. However, sales lagged and by 1979 the development was considered a liability by the corporation, then renamed AZL. Strong, owner of a controlling interest in AZL and his fiance Hanne Marstrand visited the development and fell in love with it. The Strongs were inspired to create a world spiritual center and began granting parcels of land to traditional spiritual organizations.In the late eighties, the remaining lands and waters of the ranch, now termed the Baca Ranch or Baca, were used as a base by the corporate ownership of the ranch, reorganized as American Water Development, Inc (AWDI), to make an application in the Water Courts to develop and export deep underground water to the front range cities of Colorado. This application was vigorously opposed by the local community in the Luis Valley and met defeat in the Colorado Supreme Court in 1991.(Rural area beats back water diversion plan article by Barry Noreen, Country News May 30, 1994)(In 1995, with the Baca under new ownership, a new group of investors initiated another water exportation plan. The Stockmans Water plan, as it was known, was the creation of San Luis Valley native Gary Boyce and his Cabeza de Baca company. The Stockmans Water plan was defeated in the Colorado legislature in 1998.(Valley of the Dunes by Bob Rozinski and Wendy Shattil, Fulcrum Publishing, 2005, pgs. 143-144)Bankrupt, the lands of the corporation, after sustained litigation, were purchased by the Conservancy and subsequently incorporated into the public lands of the United States, the southern and eastern portions as national forest and the Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve and the northern and western portions as the National Wildlife Refuge.(97,000 Acres Protected for New National Park article by Cat Lazaroff, News Service (ENS), January 30, 2002) The original ranch headquarters and other buildings are on the wildlife refuge. As is usual on federal wildlife refuges, grazing and hay production continue on a limited basis.Notes(

 signature Robert Lee Signature.svgRobert Lee (March 10, 1862  August 5, 1925) was a politician in Alberta, Canada and a mayor of Edmonton.BiographyLee was born in County, Ontario on March 10, 1862 and graduated from the Dominion Business College in Kingston.  He married Annette Wilson, with whom he would have a daughter and two sons, in 1897.  He served as a member of the Lanark City Council from 1892 until 1898, after which he moved to Edmonton.  He was in partnership with John Ross in grain trading, insurance, and loans under the name Ross & Lee until 1902, after which he partnered with W I Crafts in real estate, timber, and coal mining under the name Crafts & Lee (another partner was admitted in 1905 as they became Crafts, Lee & Gallinger).  He served on the public school board from 1902 until 1904.He first sought municipal office in 1907, when he was elected to a two year term as alderman on City Council, finishing fourth of twelve candidates in an election in which the top five candidates were elected.  He resigned midway through his term to run for mayor in the 1908 election, when he defeated Bellamy by 1303 votes to 639.  He was re-elected in 1909, defeating Manson, but did not seek re-election in 1910 and stayed out of municipal politics thereafter.In 1905 he erected the Lee Block on the corner of Jasper Avenue and Second Street (102 Street). The building housed, among other businesses, Reeds Bazaar. It was destroyed by fire in 1913 but a reconstruction of the building now stands at Edmonton Park.

Charles_Stine
Charles Milton Altland Stine (18821954) was a chemist and a vice-president of DuPont who created the laboratory from which nylon and other significant inventions were made.  He was also a devout Christian who authored a book about religion and science.After receiving a Ph.D. at Hopkins University in 1907, Stine began work in Duponts research laboratories on a project to make explosives safer to handle.  With C.C. Ahlum, he used sulfite as a purifying agent to crystallize trinitrotoluol (TNT).  After studying the leakage of liquid components from dynamite, Stine was able to develop a more stable version of the explosive for use in mining.  He developed improved methosds for manufacture of nitrate, extraction of tetryl from dimethylanine, acid from chlorobenzene, and for chlorinating benzene.  During the 1920s, synthetic resins were developed in his laboratories, and improved processes were found for manufacturing acid and acid.(Current Biography 1940, pp 769-70)After becoming director of Duponts chemical department in 1924, Dr. Stine was able to hire Dr. Carothers away from teaching at Harvard.  Stine lobbied Dupont management for a budget exclusively devoted to speculative research.(Susannah Handley, Nylon: The Story of a Fashion Revolution (Johns Hopkins University Press 1999))  In 1930, he succeeded in obtaining a $300,000 annual allocation, and concentrated with Carothers on colloid chemistry and development of polymers.  Byproducts included a synthetic, chloroprene rubber, but the most notable invention came in 1938 with the creation of nylon.(DuPont Heritage: Charles M.A. Stine)Among his awards were the Medal in 1940.The Charles M.A. Stine Award of the AIChE is awarded annually by their Materials Engineering and Sciences Division.(MESD C.S. Stine Award)The son of a minister, Stine also wrote a book about his faith and his work as a scientist, entitled A Chemist and His Bible, published in 1943.  Stine died in 1954 at the age of 72.References

George_W._Taylor_(professor)
George W. Taylor (July 10, 1901 - December 15, 1972) was a notable professor of relations at the Wharton School at the of Pennsylvania, and is credited with founding the academic field of study known as relations.(Shils, George W. Taylor: Industrial Peacemaker, Monthly Labor Review, December 1995.) He served in several capacities in the federal government, most notably as a mediator and arbitrator.  During his career, Taylor settled more than 2,000 strikes.(George W. Taylor Dies At 71, The New York Times, December 17, 1972.)In 1967, he helped draft the York state service law which legalized bargaining in that state but which also banned strikes by public employeeslegislation widely known today as the Law.(Donovan, Administering the Taylor Law: Public Employee Relations in New York, 1990.)Early lifeTaylor was born in the Kensington industrial neighborhood of Pennsylvania, on July 10, 1901.  His uncle owned a textile mill, and his father, Harry Taylor, was a superintendent at a hosiery mill.  He graduated from High School in 1919.  Taylor intended to go into the mills after graduating from high school, but his high school principal persuaded him to attend college instead.((In 1921, Taylor graduated with a degree in economics from the Wharton School.  His senior thesis was on the history and overdevelopment of the hosiery industry in Pennsylvania. He became a professor in the department of administration at College, and obtained his doctorate in economics from the Wharton School in 1929.((Academic careerIn 1926, George Taylor introduced the index theory, which holds that hemlines on womens dresses fluctuate with the economy, measured by stock prices or gross domestic product. The theory  still receives regular attention in the media and, in 2010, some academic validation.(http://publishing.eur.nl/ir/repub/asset/20147/EI%202010-40.pdf)In 1930, Taylor received an appointment as an assistant professor at his alma mater, the Wharton School.  In his first years as a professor at Wharton, Taylor founded the academic field of industrial relations, which covered labor arbitration, mediation, and other forms of dispute resolution. In his lifetime, he became known as the Father of American Arbitration.(Teaching was Taylors first love throughout his life.  He often said that he had chalk in his veins and hated to leave the classroom.( He was recognized as a dynamic speaker and excellent lecturer, and remained a highly sought-after public speaker even at the time of his death.(Taylor was named a full professor in 1944, and was eventually named to the Gaylord P. and Mary Louise Harnwell Professor of Industry. Upon his retirement from active teaching in 1964, the University of Pennsylvania named the endowed chair after him.  He continued to lecture and speak to students on campus until his death in 1972.((Industrial relations careerIn 1928, Taylor received his first commission as an industrial relations specialist.  His thesis on the hosiery industry in Pennsylvania led Rieve, president of a Pennsylvania hosiery workers union, to seek his help as an umpire in an organizing dispute. In 1929, he settled his first strike, at the Aberle Hosiery Mill near Pennsylvania.(Taylor received national acclaim for helping mediate an end to a strike at Apex Hosiery in Philadelphia in 1932. Under the terms of the 1931 bargaining agreement between the Full Fashioned Hosiery Manufacturers of America and the Federation of Hosiery Workers, he was appointed impartial chairman for the independent arbitration committee established by the contract. The position became a model for similar collective bargaining clauses nationwide.  During his 10 years as impartial chairman, Taylor established a national minimum wage in the hosiery industry.(In 1935, after a period of service to the federal government, Taylor become impartial chairman for a labor arbitration committee established by the Mens Clothing Manufacturers Association and the Clothing Workers of America. He held that position until 1961.(By 1940, Taylor had settled roughly 1,400 labor disputes without a strike.(In 1941, Taylor served as an impartial arbitrator between the Auto Workers (UAW) and Motors. During this time, he became close with UAW president Reuther.(Taylor entered federal service again in 1951.  He left it in 1952, and although he continued to teach at the Wharton School he also was the official arbitrator of internal of Industrial Organizations (CIO) jurisdictional disputes.  He served in this capacity for three years, and his work became a model for handling inter-union disputes after the Federation of Labor (AFL) and CIO merged in 1955.(Shils, Industrial Peacemaker: George W. Taylors Contribution to Collective Bargaining, 1979.)During his lifetime, Taylor was credited with coining a number of common collective bargaining terms, including tandem, escalator clause, productivity improvement, interplant inequity, and ability to pay.(Taylor was a strong advocate of private sector collective bargaining, but believed that governments had the right to significantly restrict collective bargaining and the right to strike in the public sector.  He was a strong advocate of the Labor Relations Act, and vehemently condemned the Act as poor public policy and an improper restriction on the right to strike.  In many important labor disputes, however, Taylor often took positions opposed to those advocated by labor unions because Taylor believed strikes should serve the public and not a private good.( As he once noted::There is too much talk about the right to strike and too little about the purpose of strikes and whether they serve their purpose. But what really is thrilling is when representatives of labor and management finally come to an agreement and realize the immense satisfaction of having created order out of conflict. I think thats the essence of democracy.(Public serviceIn 1933, Taylor was appointed chairman for the Philadelphia regional office of the Labor Board. Later that year, President D. Roosevelt appointed him assistant deputy administrator of the Recovery Administration. Taylor left federal service in 1935, although he continued to serve as an advisor to the Labor Standards Administration throughout the 1930s.(President Roosevelt appointed Taylor vice chairman of the War Labor Board in 1942. He became the boards chairman in 1945. In July 1942, Taylor wrote the wage decision popularly known as the Little Steel formula which gave workers employed by smaller steel companies only modest pay increases for the duration of the war.(Dubofsky and Van Tine, John L. Lewis: A Biography, 1992, p. 418-420; Atleson, Labor and the Wartime State: Labor Relations and Law During World War II, 1998.) The board applied the Little Steel formula to nearly every American industry during War II. The decision was severely criticized by organized labor, but Taylor considered it to be one of the most significant, well-written, and well-founded policy decisions he ever made.((War Labor Board, Time, January 19, 1942.)President S. Truman named Taylor secretary of the National Labor-Management Conference in 1946. The same year, Truman appointed Taylor chairman of the Advisory Board of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion. Taylor also served as a consultant to the on Reorganization of the Executive Branch from 1948 to 1949.((In 1951, Truman appointed Taylor director of the Stabilization Board.(((Lawrence, New Englander Is Designated Economic Stabilization Head, New York Times, November 27, 1951.)During the strike of 1959, President Eisenhower appointed Taylor chairman of the Presidential Board of Inquiry created when Eisenhower invoked the cooling-off provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act. Despite Taylors role in helping Eisenhower win a court injunction stopping the strike for 90s days, Taylor became involved in helping end the strike.  He assisted Steelworkers of America counsel Goldberg and Steel heir Kaiser negotiate an agreement which later formed the basis for the national collective bargaining agreement which settled the strike.(Shils, Arthur Goldberg: Proof of the American Dream, Monthly Labor Review, January 1997; Stebenne, Arthur J. Goldberg: New Deal Liberal, 1996; Rose, The Struggle Over Management Rights At US Steel, 1946-1960: A Reassessment of Section 2-B of the Collective Bargaining Contract, Business History Review, Autumn 1998.)In 1961, President F. Kennedy appointed Taylor to the Presidents Advisory Committee on Labor Management Policy. During his tenure on the committee, Taylor helped craft a long-term contractual solution to a series of wildcat strikes which had plagued the aerospace industry since World War II. Taylor also resolved railroad disputes in 1964 and 1967, and in 1968 settled the long-running copper mining strike.(In 1961, Taylor led a commission appointed by New York City Mayor F. Wagner, Jr. which crafted a settlement that led to collective bargaining for teachers in York City. The subsequent election led to the founding of the Federation of Teachers (UFT).  In 1965, Taylor led a fact-finding board which the UFT used to win its first collective bargaining agreement with the city.(Selden, The Teacher Rebellion, 1985; Taft, United They Teach: The Story of the United Federation of Teachers, 1974.)But Taylors most famous (and, according to New York state labor leaders, notorious) act as a public official was his role in crafting New Yorks Taylor Law. In the wake of the formation of the UFT and (more immediately) a New York City transit strike, Governor Rockefeller appointed a Committee on Public Employment Relations to study the states public employee collective bargaining laws. Taylor led the other five members of the panel in proposing new legislation which gave New Yorks public employees significantly stronger collective bargaining rights.  On April 25, 1967, Gov. Rockefeller signed the Public Employees Fair Employment Act into law.  Popularly known as the Taylor Law, the Act is considered a model for public sector labor legislation. The law established collective bargaining rights for state-employed workers, and set up procedures and mechanisms for county and local public workers to establish unions and bargain collectively.((Kearney, Labor Relations in the Public Sector, 1984; Marmo, More Profile Than Courage: The New York City Transit Strike of 1966, 1990.)Two aspects of the law, however, drew harsh criticism from organized labor. Section 210 prohibits public employees from striking, and fines the union double the amount of each striking employees salary for each day the strike lasts. Section 201, Part 4, of the law prohibits employers from negotiating benefits provided by a public retirement fund or providing income to public sector retirees.((Personal life and honorsPresident B. Johnson awarded Taylor the Medal of Freedom on December 3, 1963.((http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/laborhall/1994_taylor.htm)On January 5, 1995, Taylor was inducted into the U.S. Department of Labor Hall of Fame for his contributions to industrial relations.(During his life, Taylor became close friends with many of the most important labor and government officials of his day: Perkins, Ching, Meany, Murray, Kerr, Heller, J. Kaiser, L. Lewis, Schultz, Dunlop, and Willard Wirtz.(Taylor retired from the Wharton School in 1971.( He died at his home in Philadelphia on the evening of December 15, 1972. He was survived by his wife, the former Edith Ayling; he had no children.(See also*LawNotesReferences*Atleson, James B. Labor and the Wartime State: Labor Relations and Law During World War II.

Marsh_rice_rat
The marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) is a semiaquatic North American rodent in the family Cricetidae. It is found mostly in the eastern and southern United States, from Jersey and Kansas south to Florida and northeasternmost Tamaulipas, Mexico; its range previously extended further west and north, where it may have been a commensal in corn-cultivating communities. It usually occurs in wet habitats such as swamps and saltmarshes. Weighing about 40 to 80 g (1.4 to 2.8 oz), the marsh rice rat is a medium-sized rodent that resembles the common black and rat. The upperparts are generally gray-brown, but reddish in many Florida populations. The feet show several specializations for life in the water. The skull is large and flattened and is short at the front.Bachman discovered the marsh rice rat in 1816, and it was formally described in 1837. Several subspecies have been described since the 1890s, mainly from Florida, but there is disagreement over their validity. The Keys population is sometimes classified as a different species, the silver rice rat (Oryzomys argentatus). Data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicate a deep divergence between populations east of Mississippi and those further west, which suggests that the western populations may be recognized as a separate species, Oryzomys texensis. The species is part of the genus Oryzomys, which also includes several others occurring further south in Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America, some of which have previously been regarded as subspecies of the marsh rice rat. One, couesi, occurs with the marsh rice rat in Tamaulipas and southern Texas.The marsh rice rat is active during the night, makes nests of sedge and grass, and occasionally builds runways. It has a diverse diet that includes plants, fungi, and a variety of animals. Population densities are usually below 10 per ha (4 per acre) and home ranges vary from 0.23 to 0.37 ha (0.57 to 0.91 acres), depending on sex and geography. Litters of generally three to five young are born after a pregnancy of about 25 days, mainly during the summer. Newborns are helpless at birth, but are weaned after a few weeks. Several animals prey on the marsh rice rat, including the owl, and it usually lives for less than a year in the wild. It is infected by many different parasites and harbors a hantavirus that also infects humans. The species is not of conservation concern, but some populations are threatened.TaxonomyThe marsh rice rat is classified as one of eight species in the genus Oryzomys, which is distributed from the eastern United States (marsh rice rat) into northwestern South America (O. gorgasi).(Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p. 106) Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were reclassified in various studies culminating in contributions by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than forty species from the genus.(Weksler et al., 2006, table 1) All are placed in the tribe Oryzomyini (rice rats), a diverse assemblage of over a hundred species,(Weksler, 2006, p. 3) and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents, most of which occur in South and Central America. In the United States, the marsh rice rat is the only oryzomyine rodent except for couesi in a small area of southern Texas; the only other sigmodontines present are several species of rats (Sigmodon) in the southern half of the country.(Musser and Carleton, 2005)Early historyThe marsh rice rat was discovered in 1816 in Carolina by Bachman.(Chapman, 1893, p. 43) Bachman intended to describe the species as Arvicola oryzivora, but sent a specimen to Harlan and Charles Pickering at the of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia to confirm its identity.(Audubon and Bachman, 1854, p. 216) Another specimen, from Jersey, was found in the Academys collection, and Harlan took it upon himself, against Pickerings wishes, to describe the new species as Mus palustris, proclaiming it one of the few true rats of the United States.(Audubon and Bachman, 1854, p. 216; Harlan, 1837, p. 386; Chapman, 1893, p. 43; Goldman, 1918, pp. 89) The specific name palustris is Latin for marshy and refers to the usual habitat of the species.(Merritt, 1987, p. 173; Schwartz and Schwartz, 2001, p. 192)In 1854, in The quadrupeds of North America, Bachman redescribed it as Arvicola oryzivora, considering it more closely related to the voles then placed in the genus Arvicola, and also recorded it from Georgia and Florida.( Three years later, Fullerton Baird argued that the referral of the species to Arvicola was erroneous and introduced a new generic name for the marsh rice rat, Oryzomys.(Baird, 1857, pp. 458, 482, 484; Goldman, 1918, p. 9) The name combines the Greek oryza rice and mys mouse and refers to the rats habit of eating rice.( At the time, Oryzomys was recognized either as a full genus or as a subgenus of the now-defunct genus Hesperomys,( but since the 1890s, it has been universally recognized as a genus distinct from Hesperomys, with the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) as its species.(Goldman, 1918, p. 9; Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p. 116)Species boundaries and subspeciesIn the 1890s, several subspecies of the marsh rice rat were described from the United States: natator from Florida in 1893,( texensis from Texas in 1894,( and coloratus from elsewhere in Florida in 1898.( Hart Merriam recognized natator as a separate species in 1901 and described a subspecies of it, floridanus, but considered texensis to be nearly identical to nominate palustris.(Merriam, 1901, pp. 276277) In his 1918 revision of North American Oryzomys, Alphonso Goldman again recognized all these as a single species, Oryzomys palustris. He distinguished four subspecies, which he said formed a closely intergrading seriesO. p. palustris from New Jersey to southeastern Mississippi and eastern Missouri; O. p. natator in central Florida; O. p. coloratus (including O. natator floridanus Merriam) in southern Florida; and O. p. texensis from western Mississippi and southeastern Kansas to eastern Texas.( Two additional subspecies were described by William J. Hamilton in 1955 from southern Florida: planirostris from Pine Island and two miles (3 km) north of Fort Myers( and sanibeli from Island.( Also in 1955, W. Hibbard described a new species of Oryzomys, O. fossilis, from Pleistocene deposits in Kansas, on the basis of small differences in characters of the tooth with living marsh rice rats.( In 1965, Walter Dalquest demoted this species, later also found in Texas, to a subspecies, because it does not differ more from living marsh rice rats than the latter differ from each other.(Dalquest, 1965, p. 70)Merriam and Goldman had recognized that a number of Central American species, including Oryzomys couesi and numerous forms with more limited distributions, are related to the marsh rice rat.(Merriam, 1901, p. 275; Goldman, 1918, p. 20) O. couesi ranges north to southernmost Texas, where its distribution meets that of the marsh rice rat. In 1960, Raymond Hall argued that specimens from the contact zone were intermediate between the local forms of O. couesi and the marsh rice rat, and accordingly included the former in the marsh rice rat.(Hall, 1960, pp. 172173) While reporting on the ecology of Texan O. couesi in 1979, Benson and Gehlbach noted that populations of O. couesi and the marsh rice rat there were in fact distinct, with the latter being smaller and less brown and more gray in color; their karyotypes were also distinct.(Benson and Gehlbach, 1979, p. 227, table 2) Since then, the two have generally been retained as distinct species, as supported by further research; a 1994 study even found the two to occur at some of the same places (in sympatry) in southern Texas and nearby Tamaulipas, Mexico.(Schmidt and Engstrom, 1994, p. 419; Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1147)In 1973, rice rats were discovered at Key in the Keys, and in 1978 Spitzer and Lazell described this population as a new species, Oryzomys argentatus.(Spitzer and Lazell, 1978, p. 787) The status of this formeither a distinct species(Goodyear, 1991, p. 423) or not even subspecifically distinct from O. palustris natator(Humphrey and Setzer, 1989, p. 557)has remained controversial since; the 2005 third edition of Species of the World does not recognize O. argentatus as a separate species, but acknowledges a need for further research.(Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1153) A 2005 study using microsatellite DNA found that Florida Keys rice rats exhibit low genetic variation and are significantly different from Everglades rice rats; the study concluded in favor of classifying the Keys rice rat as a distinct vertebrate population.(Wang et al., 2005, p. 575) This population probably diverged from mainland rice rats about 2000 years ago.(Wang et al., 2005, p. 581)Among the described subspecies, a 1989 morphometrical study by Humphrey and Setzer separated only twonatator from much of Florida (including coloratus, planirostris, sanibeli, and floridanus, as well as argentatus) and palustris from the rest of the range (including texensis).(Humphrey and Setzer, 1989, p. 557; Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1152) On the other hand, Whitaker and Hamilton in their 1998 book on the Mammals of the Eastern United States recognized planirostris and sanibeli as separate subspecies, but merged all others into O. palustris palustris, and placed O. argentatus as a separate species; their classification was based on their emphasis of overwater gaps as agents of biological diversification and a critique of shortcomings in Humphrey and Setzers study, not on a reanalysis of the data.(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 281; Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1152)In 2010, Delton Hanson and colleagues published a study of the relationships among populations of Oryzomys on the basis of data from three genesthe mitochondrial gene cytochrome b (Cytb) and two nuclear markers, exon 1 of the retinoid-binding protein gene (Rbp3) and intron 2 of dehydrogenase gene 1 (Adh1-I2).(Hanson et al., 2010, p. 337) The Cytb data placed all marsh rice rats studied sister to a clade containing various populations of O. couesi; the mean genetic distance between the two groups was 11.30%. The marsh rice rats fell into two main groups, differing on average by 6.05%, one containing animals from Mississippi, southwestern Tennessee, and further west, and the other including specimens from Alabama and further east. Within the eastern group, variation was only about 0.65%, even though examples of the putative subspecies palustris, coloratus, sanibeli, and planirostris were all included.(Hanson et al., 2010, figs. 12, table 1) Data from both of the slower-evolving nuclear markers Rbp3 and Adh1-I2 also placed examples of Oryzomys in two main clades, but did not recover the western and eastern groups of the marsh rice rat as separate clades. In addition, Adh1-I2 placed a Costa Rican population within the marsh rice rat clade and some other southern Oryzomys specimens closer to the marsh rice rat than to the O. couesi group.(Hanson et al., 2010, figs. 1, 34) The combined dataset supported the western and eastern clades within the marsh rice rat and placed the Costa Rican population marginally closer to the marsh rice rat than to O. couesi.(Hanson et al., 2010, fig. 5) Using the species concept, the authors suggested that the western populations of the marsh rice rat be recognized as a separate species, Oryzomys texensis. They recommended further research in the MississippiAlabamaTennessee region, where the ranges of the two meet.(Hanson et al., 2010, p. 342)Common namesMany names have been proposed for the marsh rice rat. Early describers used Rice Meadow-Mouse( and Rice-field Mouse(Baird, 1857, p. 482) and in the early 1900s, name such as rice rat, marsh mouse, and swamp rice rat came into use.(Stone and Cram, 1903, p. 129; Eliot, 1905, p. 275; Steward, 1951, p. 427) Some of the subspecies received their own common names, such as Florida Marsh Mouse,(Stone and Cram, 1903, p. 130) Swimming Rice Rat,( and Central Florida Rice Rat for O. p. natator;(Goldman, 1918, p. 25) Bangs Marsh Mouse,( Cape Sable Rice Rat,(Eliot, 1905, p. 181) and Everglades Rice Rat for O. p. coloratus;(Goldman, 1918, p. 26) and Texas Rice Rat for O. p. texensis.(Goldman, 1918, p. 27) The species is now usually known as the marsh rice rat,(Wolfe, 1982, p. 1; Linzey and Hammerson, 2008; Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 278) although marsh oryzomys has also been in recent use.(Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1152; Milazzo et al., 2006, p. 1003) The Florida Keys form (argentatus) is known as the silver rice rat.(DescriptionThe marsh rice rat is a medium-sized rodent that looks much like the common black and rats, but has greater differences in color between the upper- and underparts.(Wolfe, 1982, p. 1; Whitaker and Hamilton, 1982, pp. 278279; Kays and Wilson, 2000, p. 108) The fur is thick and short.(Carleton and Musser, 1989, pp. 2223) The upperparts are generally gray to grayish brown, with the head a bit lighter, and are sharply delimited from the underparts, which are off-white, as are the feet. There are small pouches. The ears are about the same color as the upperparts, but there is a patch of light hairs in front of them. The tail is dark brown above and may be paler below.(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1982, p. 279; Kays and Wilson, 2000, p. 108; Goldman, 1918, p. 23; Carleton and Musser, 1989, p. 24; Merritt, 1987, p. 173) The hairs are long and have unpigmented, silvery tips.( When rice rats swim, air is trapped in the fur, which increases buoyancy and reduces heat loss.(Esher et al., 1978, p. 551) As in most other oryzomyines, females have eight mammae.(Carleton and Musser, 1989, p. 23)The forefeet have four and the hindfeet five digits.( On the forefeet, the tufts (tufts of hair on the digits) are absent.(Weksler, 2006, p. 23) The hindfeet are broad and have a short fifth digit. Many of the pads are reduced, as are the ungual tufts, but there are small interdigital webs.(Carleton and Musser, 1989, p. 24; Weksler, 2006, pp. 2325) The Florida Keys form, argentatus, has even more reduced ungual tufts.(Spitzer and Lazell, 1978, p. 787; Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 276) Many of these traits are common adaptations to life in the water in oryzomyines.(Weksler, 2006, pp. 79, 81)There is some geographic variation in fur color: western populations (texensis) are lighter than those from the east (nominate palustris), and Florida populations are generally more tawny or reddish than either, with those from southern Florida (coloratus) being brighter than those from the center of the state (natator).(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 279; Wolfe, 1982, p. 1; Goldman, 1918, p. 20) The Florida Keys form (argentatus) is silvery,(Kays and Wilson, 2000, p. 108) and the two other Florida formsplanirostris and sanibelilack the reddish tones of mainland Florida populations and are instead grayish, resembling nominate palustris (planirostris), or brownish (sanibeli).(Humphrey and Setzer, 1989, p. 558) In 1989, Humphrey and Setzer reviewed variation in color among Florida populations. They found argentatus to be substantially lighter and planirostris and sanibeli to be somewhat darker than mainland populations, and argentatus to have a less yellow fur, but found no significant differences in redness. There was also substantial variation within populations.(Humphrey and Setzer, 1989, pp. 563564)Total length is 226 to 305 mm (8.9 to 12.0 in), tail length 108 to 156 mm (4.3 to 6.1 in), hindfoot length 28 to 37 mm (1.1 to 1.5 in),( and body mass 40 to 80 g (1.4 to 2.8 oz), with males slightly larger than females.( The largest individuals occur in Florida and along the Coast east of the Mississippi River delta.(Goldman, 1918, p. 22)The stomach has the characteristic pattern of sigmodontines (unilocular-hemiglandular): it is not split in two chambers by an angularis and the front part (antrum) is covered by a epithelium.(Weksler, 2006, p. 59) The bladder is absent, a synapomorphy (shared-derived character) of Oryzomyini.(Weksler, 2006, pp. 5859) The karyotype includes 56 chromosomes and a fundamental number of 60 chromosomal arms (2n  56, FN  60).( The form of the chromosomes has been used to distinguish the marsh rice rat from Oryzomys couesi, but may be too variable among Oryzomys to be useful in differentiating species.(Hershkovitz, 1987, p. 154) X chromosome inactivation occurs in the marsh rice rat, even though the animal lacks LINE-1 retrotransposons, which have been suggested as components of the inactivation process.(Cantrell et al., 2009, p. 1) Mutants with fused or additional molars and with light fur have been recorded in laboratory colonies;(Wolfe, 1982, p. 4) the abnormal molars are apparently the result of a single recessive mutation.(Sofaer and Shaw, 1971, p. 99) At about 50%,( hematocrit (the proportion of red blood cells in the blood) is high in the marsh rice rat compared to other rodents; this may be an adaptation that enables the rice rat to increase oxygen capacity while swimming underwater.(Stalling and Haynes, 1982, p. 306)Male reproductive anatomyThe penis is long and robust,(Hooper and Musser, 1964, p. 13) averaging 7.3 mm (0.29 in) long and 4.6 mm (0.18 in) broad, and the baculum (penis bone) is 6.6 mm (0.26 in) long.(Hooper and Musser, 1964, table 1) As is characteristic of Sigmodontinae, the marsh rice rat has a complex penis, with the distal (far) end of the baculum ending in three digits.(Weksler, 2006, pp. 5556) The central digit is notably larger than those at the sides.( The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue.(Weksler, 2006, pp. 5657) The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of the penis is covered with small spines, a character the marsh rice rat shares only with Oligoryzomys and Oryzomys couesi among oryzomyines examined.(Hooper and Musser, 1964, p. 13; Weksler, 2006, p. 57) On the process, located in the crater at the end of the penis,(Hooper and Musser, 1964, p. 7) a fleshy process (the lobule) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except O. couesi and brasiliensis.(Weksler, 2006, p. 57) The baculum is deeper than it is wide.(Some features of the accessory glands in the male genital region vary among oryzomyines. In the marsh rice rat, a single pair of glands is present at the penis. As is usual for sigmodontines, there are two pairs of ventral prostate glands and a single pair of anterior and dorsal prostate glands. Part of the end of the gland is irregularly folded, not smooth as in most oryzomyines.(Weksler, 2006, pp. 5758; Voss and Linzey, 1981, p. 13)SkullThe marsh rice rat has a large, flattened skull(Wolfe, 1982, p. 1) with a short and broad rostrum (front part).(Carleton and Musser, 1989, p. 25) The nasal and premaxillary bones extend back beyond the point where the lacrimal, frontal, and bones meet.(Weksler, 2006, pp. 2728, table 5) In planirostris, the rostrum is flatter than in mainland Florida forms, in which it is more convex,( and the nasals are said to be relatively longer in argentatus.(Spitzer and Lazell, 1978, p. 788) The plate, the flattened front part of the arch (cheekbone), is broad and develops a notch at its front end. The arches themselves are robust and contain small but distinct bones.(Carleton and Musser, 1989, p. 26) The foramen, a foramen (opening) in the side of the skull above the molars, is large; it is much smaller in O. couesi.( The narrowest part of the region (located between the eyes) is towards the front and the edges are lined by prominent shelves.(Carleton and Musser, 1989, p. 27; Weksler, 2006, p. 28, table 5) The marsh rice rat has a narrow braincase lined by prominent ridges and a narrow bone.(Carleton and Musser, 1989, p. 29) According to Goldman, Florida animals (coloratus and natator) generally have the largest and broadest skulls, and western specimens (texensis) have somewhat smaller and narrower skulls than those from the east outside Florida (nominate palustris).(Goldman, 1918, pp. 2327) In argentatus, the skull is also relatively narrow.(The incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, reach backward between the molars. The palate is long, extending substantially beyond the third molars. The back part, near the third molars, is usually perforated by prominent palatal pits, which are recessed into fossae (depressions). The fossa, the gap behind the end of the palate, is perforated by vacuities, which are set far to the front.(Carleton and Musser, 1989, p. 30) The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived.(Weksler, 2006, p. 37) The fenestra, an opening in the back part of the skull determined by the shape of the bone, is present.(Weksler, 2006, pp. 3839) The squamosal lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tympani, the roof of the cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines.(Weksler, 2006, p. 40) There are some openings in the bone.(Weksler, 2006, pp. 4041)In the mandible (lower jaw), the foramen, an opening just before the first molar, opens sidewards, not upwards as in a few other oryzomyines.(Weksler, 2006, p. 41, table 5) The upper and lower ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, join at a point below the first molar and do not extend forward beyond that point.(Weksler, 2006, p. 42) The process, a raising of the bone of the back of the mandible that houses the back end of the incisor, is present, but not as large as in O. couesi.(Weksler, 2006, pp. 4142)TeethThe formula is  (one upper and one lower incisor and three upper and three lower molars),(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 279) as usual in muroid rodents.(Carleton and Musser, 1984, p. 292) The upper incisors are well-developed and strongly opisthodont, with the chewing edge located behind the vertical plane of the teeth.(Carleton and Musser, 1989, p. 37) The molars are bunodont, with the cusps higher than the connecting crests, and brachydont, low-crowned, as in most other oryzomyines.(Weksler, 2006, pp. 4344) Many accessory crests, including the mesoloph on the upper molars and the mesolophid on the lower molars, are present, another trait the marsh rice rat shares with most but not all other oryzomyines.(Weksler, 2006, pp. 4449) The flexi and flexids (valleys between the cusps and crests) at the labial (outer) side of the molars are closed by cingula (ridges).(The upper molars have two longitudinal rows of cusps, not three as in the black and brown rats.(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, pp. 278279) The first and second upper molar are oval in form(Carleton and Musser, 1989, pp. 40, 42) and the flexi do not extend to the midline of the molars.(Weksler, 2006, p. 44) The anterocone, the front cusp of the upper first molar, is not divided in two by an indentation at its front (flexus), but does display a hollow in the middle, the fossette, which divides it into separate cuspules at the labial and lingual (inner) sides of the molar. A crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the labial cuspule, but in older animals, the cusps and the crest are united into a single structure by wear.(Carleton and Musser, 1989, pp. 3940) In the third upper molar, the cusps at the back are reduced and scarcely distinguishable.(Carleton and Musser, 1989, p. 42) As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side; in addition, the first upper molar usually has another small labial root.(Carleton and Musser, 1989, pp. 4546; fig. 26A)The first lower molar is rounded at the front end and the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are barely distinct. The second lower molar is elongate and has a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps that form the front edge of the molar in some other oryzomyines, the protoconid and metaconid.(Carleton and Musser, 1989, p. 43) There is a distinct ridge (cingulum) at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid.(Weksler, 2006, p. 49) The lower third molar is about as long as the second and also has an anterolophid, albeit a less well-defined one.(Carleton and Musser, 1989, p. 44) The first lower molar has large roots at the front and back of the tooth and usually one or two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have either two roots, one labial and one lingual, or only one at the front, and another large root at the back.(Carleton and Musser, 1989, p. 46, fig. 27A, B)Postcranial skeletonAs usual in oryzomyines, there are twelve ribs. The first rib articulates with both the last cervical (neck) and first thoracic (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae.(Weksler, 2006, p. 52, table 5) Anapophyses, processes at the back of a vertebra, are absent from the fifth lumbar.(Weksler, 2006, pp. 5253) Between the second and third vertebrae, arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border.(Weksler, 2006, p. 53; fig. 28) The foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen perforates the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone).(Weksler, 2006, p. 54)PhysiologyStudies have shown that in poor conditions the weight of the gland may increase up to 200%,(Wolfe, 1982, p. 2) that rice rats are unable to conserve water well when dehydrated,(Stalling and Haynes, 1982, p. 301) and that in water contaminated with oil they swim less and their mortality increases.(Wolfe and Esher, 1981, p. 489) The median amount of radiation needed to kill a marsh rice rat is 5.25 Gy and the lethal dose of cyanide is 7.20 mg/kg; both values are relatively low for cricetid rodents.(OFarrell and Dilley, 1975, table 1) In one study, wild rice rats in radioactively contaminated areas did not show signs of disease.(Childs and Cosgrove, 1966, p. 309) Experiments have found that exposure to more daylight and higher food availability cause increased development of the gonads in both adult and juvenile rice rats.(Edmonds et al., 2003, p. 41) When the gland is removed or melatonin is administered in male rice rats, the testes are reduced and tend to regress into the body.(Edmonds and Stetson, 1995, p. 274)Distribution and habitatFile:Oryzomys palustris.jpg|thumb|left|altRat, yellow-brown above and white below|A marsh rice rat walking on mesh in Prairie, FloridaThe marsh rice rat currently occurs in much of the eastern and southern United States, northeast to southern New Jersey, and south to southeastern Texas and far northeastern Tamaulipas, Mexico.(Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1152; Wolfe, 1982, p. 1; Schmidt and Engstrom, 1994, p. 914) The northernmost records in the interior United States are in eastern Oklahoma, southeastern Kansas, southern Missouri and Illinois, and the southern half of Kentucky, but the species is absent in much of the Appalachians.(Wolfe, 1982, p. 1; Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1142) Fossils of the marsh rice rat are known from Rancholabrean (late Pleistocene, less than 300,000 years ago) deposits in Florida and Georgia(Weksler, 2006, p. 88; Wolfe, 1982, p. 1) and remains referred to the extinct subspecies O. p. fossilis are from the Wisconsinan and Sangamonian of Texas and Illinoian and Sangamonian of Kansas.(Wolfe, 1982, p. 1; Hibbard, 1955, p. 213; Dalquest, 1962, p. 575; 1965, pp. 63, 70) In the Florida Keys, rice rats occur on most of the Keys, but are absent from the Keys, which are of a different geological origin and were probably never connected to the mainland.(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 277) The western and eastern Cytb clades within the marsh rice rat may represent expansions from different refugia which the species was restricted to during a period.(Cave and archeological remains indicate that the range of the marsh rice rat has extended substantially further north and west earlier in the Holocene, into central Texas, eastern Nebraska, southwestern Iowa, central Illinois, southern Indiana, southern Ohio, Virginia, and southwestern Pennsylvania.(Wolfe, 1982, p. 1; Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1142; Richards, 1980, fig. 1; Winkler, 1990, p. 202) Most northern archeological sites date from about 1000 CE and are associated with corn cultivation, but in some older cave sites the rice rat is found with the extinct giant armadillo bellus, suggesting warm climatic conditions. Perhaps a warm period during the Quaternary enabled the rice rat to disperse northward and when the climate cooled, relict populations were able to survive in the north as commensals in corn-cultivating Native American communities.(Richards, 1980, pp. 429430) Some subfossil animals are slightly larger than living marsh rice rats, possibly because environmental constraints were relaxed in commensal populations.(Richards, 1980, pp. 426, 429)In Tamaulipas and southern Texas, the ranges of the marsh rice rat and the related Oryzomys couesi meet;(Schmidt and Engstrom, 1994, p. 914) in parts of Kenedy, Willacy and Cameron counties, Texas, and in far northeastern Tamaulipas, the two are sympatric (occur in the same places).(Schmidt and Engstrom, 1994, p. 916) In experimental conditions, they fail to interbreed(Schmidt and Engstrom, 1994, pp. 915916) and genetic analysis yields no evidence of flow or hybridization in the wild.(Schmidt and Engstrom, 1994, p. 920) Compared to O. couesi, the marsh rice rat shows less genetic variability within but more between populations in the contact zone, probably because the species is restricted to isolated populations near the coast.(Schmidt and Engstrom, 1994, p. 922)The marsh rice rat occurs in several habitats, ranging from coastal salt marshes to mountain streams and clearings. It is semiaquatic, spending much time in the water, and usually occurs in wetland habitats. It prefers areas where the ground is covered with grasses and sedges, which protect it from predators.(Wolfe, 1982, p. 2; Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 279) In southern Illinois, marsh rice rats are more likely to occur in wetlands with more herbaceous cover, visual obstruction, and nearby grasslands.(Eubanks et al., 2011, p. 552) The species also occurs in drier uplands, which serve as sinks for young, dispersing animals and as refuges during high tide.(Kruchek, 2004, p. 569) Rice rats are adept overwater dispersers; studies on islands off Virginias Peninsula show that they readily cross 300-m (1000 ft) channels between islands.(Forys and Duesser, 1993, p. 411)Behavior and ecologyFile:Tyto alba close up.jpg|thumb|altOwl with a heart-shaped face, on a green background|The owl is an important predator of the marsh rice rat.Marsh rice rats are active during the night and for this reason are rarely seen, although they may be among the most common small mammals in part of their range. They will build nests of sedge and grass, about 13 cm (5 in) large, which are placed under debris, near shrubs, in short burrows, or high in aquatic vegetation. They may also use old nests of wrens (Cistothorus palustris), blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) or muskrats (Neofiber alleni). Marsh rice rats sometimes make large runways or dig burrows.(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 279; Wolfe, 1982, p. 4; Nesmith and Cox, 1985) They are accomplished and willing swimmers, easily swimming for more than 10 m (30 ft) under water,(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 279; Wolfe, 1982, p. 3; Esher et al., 1978, p. 556) and will often seek safety in the water when alarmed.(Schmidly and Davis, 2004, p. 381) Rice rats in the Florida Keys occasionally climb in vegetation, but never higher than 90 cm (3 ft).(Goodyear, 1992, p. 190) Marsh rice rats are very cleanly and extensively groom themselves, perhaps to keep their fur water-repellent.(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 279; Wolfe, 1982, pp. 34) They are aggressive towards conspecifics and emit high-pitched squeaks while fighting.( In dense vegetation, the range (the distance from which an animal can detect a patch of suitable habitat) of marsh rice rats is less than 10 m (33 ft).(Schooley and Branch, 2005, pp. 59, 63) When released outside of their natural wetland habitat, marsh rice rats generally move either upwind or downwind (anemotaxis), perhaps in order to move in a straight line, which is an efficient strategy to find suitable habitat.(Schooley and Branch, 2005, pp. 6465)Many animals prey on marsh rice rats. The owl (Tyto alba) is among the most important; one study found that 97.5% of vertebrate remains in barn owl pellets were marsh rice rats. Other predators include birds (hawks, Circus cyaneus; and owls, Strix varia), snakes (mocassins, Agkistrodon piscivorus; and others), alligators, and carnivorans (raccoons, Procyon lotor; foxes, Vulpes vulpes; minks, Neovison vison; weasels of the genus Mustela; and skunks, Mephitis mephitis).(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 281; Wolfe, 1982, pp. 23) Many parasites have been recorded on the marsh rice rat, including various ticks and mites, lice, and fleas among external parasites and many nematodes and digeneans, a pentastomid, and several coccidians among internal parasites (see of the marsh rice rat).(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 281; Wolfe, 1982, p. 4; Durden and Kollars, 1997)Periodontitis, a bacterial disease affecting the jaws, is particularly virulent in marsh rice rats; the animal has been proposed as a model for research on the disease in humans.(Leopard, 1979, pp. 643645) The identity of the bacterial agent remains unknown. E, fluoride, and iodide protect against bone loss associated with this disease in the rice rat and a high-sucrose diet increases the severity of periodontitis.(Cohen and Meyer, 1993, p. 601; Shklair and Ralls, 1988, p. 25; Beiraghi et al., 1988, p. 99) A case of kyphosis has been observed in a North Carolina marsh rice rat.(Webster, 1987, p. 172)Population dynamicsThe population density of the marsh rice rat usually does not reach 10 per ha (4 per acre).(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 281) The weather may influence population dynamics;( in the Everglades, densities may exceed 200 per ha (80 per acre) when flooding concentrates populations on small islands,(Bloch and Rose, 2005, p. 302) In the Florida Keys, population density is less than 1 per ha (0.4 per acre).(Wang et al., 2005, p. 576) On Island, Louisiana, perhaps an atypical habitat, home ranges in males average about 0.37 ha (0.81 acre) and in females about 0.23 ha (0.51 acre). A study in Florida found male home ranges to average 0.25 ha (0.56 acre) and female 0.33 ha (0.72 acre).(Wolfe, 1982, pp. 23)Population size is usually largest during the summer and declines during winter,( although populations in Texas and Louisiana may be more seasonally stable.(Wolfe, 1982, p. 2; Kruchek, 2004, p. 573) Animals also often lose weight during winter.(Wolfe, 1982, pp. 12) Population size varies dramatically from year to year in southern Texas.(Schmidt and Engstrom, 1994, p. 917) In coastal Mississippi, a study found that storms probably do not cause the population to decline substantially and in Texas inundation of its habitat did not significantly influence population density.(Abuzeineh et al., 2007, p. 75) However, another study in Mississippi found that flooding did cause a marked decline in rice rat abundance.(Chamberlain and Leopold, 2003, p. 307)In the northern part of its range, the species often occurs with the vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus), but there is no evidence that they compete with each other. In the south, the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) and the rice rat regularly occur together; water levels are known to influence relative abundance of these two species in Florida.(Wolfe, 1982, p. 3) The cotton rat is mainly active during the day, which may help differentiate its niche from that of the rice rat.(DietFile:Spartina alterniflora.jpg|thumb|left|altHigh, reedlike plants standing in water|alterniflora is eaten by the marsh rice rat.(The marsh rice rat takes both vegetable and animal food, and is more carnivorous than most small rodents are;(Reid, 2006, p. 303) dominant food items vary seasonally. Plants eaten include species of Spartina, Salicornia, Tripsacum, and Elymus, among others; it mainly eats seeds and succulent parts.( A 2004 study found that it prefers alterniflora that have been fertilized with nitrogen and mainly eats the inner tissue of the stem, perhaps because nitrogen-fertilized plants contain much less dimethylsulfoniopropionate in their inner tissues.(Otto et al., 2004, p. 1922) The marsh rice rat was a major pest on rice plantations, feeding on the rice when it was newly planted. It also eats the fungus Endogone at times.(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, pp. 279280; Wolfe, 1982, p. 3)Animals that are important to the marsh rice rats diet include insects, crabs, and snails, but the species is known to eat many other animals, including fish, clams, and juvenile Graptemys and Chrysemys turtles. They scavenge on carcasses of muskrats, deermice, and sparrows, and may be the most important predator on eggs and young of the marsh wren.(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 280; Wolfe, 1982, p. 3) Rice rats also eat eggs and young of the sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus)(Post, 1981, p. 35) and are aggressive towards the sparrow, apparently leading it to avoid nesting in Juncus(Post, 1981, p. 40) in a seaside salt marsh in Florida.( On islands in North Carolina, rice rats consume eggs of tern (Sterna forsteri).(Brunjes and Webster, 2003, p. 654) They have been observed preying on alligator eggs in Georgia.(Hunt and Ogden, 1991, p. 450)Laboratory studies have found that rice rats assimilate 88% to 95% of the energy in their food. They lose weight when fed on Spartina, fiddler crabs, or sunflower seeds alone, but a diet consisting of several of those items or of mealworms is adequate to maintain weight.( In an experiment, marsh rice rats did not show hoarding behavior, but wild rice rats have been observed carrying food to a nest.( Even when they live in uplands, they mostly eat water plants and animals, although they consume some upland plants.(Reproduction and life cycleBreeding occurs mostly during the summer. Some studies report that breeding ceases entirely during the winter, but winter breeding occurs as far north as Virginia. This is primarily because photoperiod influences their circadian rhythm which determines breeding. In both Texas and Virginia, there is less variation in reproductive activity in females than in males. In the south of its range, animals may breed less when the summer is at its warmest.(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 280; Edmonds et al., 2003, p. 41; Bloch and Rose, 2005, p. 303; Negus et al., 1961, p. 103) The duration of the cycle ranges from 6 to 9 days, with an average of 7.72 days. Estrus occurs again after a litter is born.( A 1970 study reported that copulatory behavior in the marsh rice rat is similar to that in laboratory brown rats. Before mating starts, the male pursues the running female from behind.(Dewsbury, 1970, p. 268) The male then repeatedly mounts and dismounts the female; not all mounts result in an ejaculation. Penetrations only last for about 250 ms, but during mating the penetrations( and the intervals between them become longer.(Dewsbury, 1970, p. 269) Even when a male is satiated after mating, it is able to copulate again when a new female is introduced (the effect).(Dewsbury, 1970, p. 271) Partly because of resistance by the female, the frequency of ejaculation during mating is rather low in marsh rice rats as compared to laboratory rats, hamsters, and deermice.(Dewsbury, 1970, p. 274)After a gestation of about 25 days, three to five young are usually born, although litter sizes vary from one to seven. Females may have up to six litters a year. Newborns weigh 3 to 4 g (about 0.1 to 0.15 oz) and are blind and almost naked. About as many males as females are born. The external ears (pinnae) soon unfold and on the first day claws are visible and the young emit high-pitched squeaks. On the second day, they are able to crawl and during the third to fifth days the whiskers and eyelids develop. On the two subsequent days, the mammae and incisors become visible and the animals become more active. Between the eighth and eleventh day, the eyes open, the fur develops, and the young begin to take solid food. Weaning occurs on the eleventh to twentieth day according to different studies. There is considerable variation in reported body masses at different ages, perhaps because of geographic variation. Sexual activity commences when the animals are about 50 to 60 days old.(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 280; Wolfe, 1982, p. 2; Linzey and Hammerson, 2008) In the wild, rice rats usually live for less than a year;( one study suggested that the average lifespan is only seven months.(Negus et al., 1961, p. 103)Human interactionsThe marsh rice rat is generally of little importance to humans, which is perhaps why it is not as well-studied as some other North American rodents.( In 1931, Arthur Svihla noted that virtually no information had been published on the habits and life history of the marsh rice rat since the 1854 publication of Audubon and Bachmans description.(Svihla, 1931, p. 238) Writing on Everglades mammals, Thomas E. Lodge notes that although the name rat may associate it unpleasantly with the introduced black and brown rats, its appearance is more endearing, even cute.(Lodge, 2005, p. 177) J.S. Steward proposed the marsh rice rat as a model organism in 1951 to study certain infections that other rodents used at the time are not susceptible to.(Steward, 1951, p. 429) The marsh rice rat is quite susceptible to periodontitis and has been used as a model system for the study of that disease.(Oz and Puleo, 2011, pp. 23)The marsh rice rat is the primary host of the virus (BAYV), the second most common agent of hantavirus infections in the United States. About 16% of animals are infected and the virus is most prevalent in old, heavy males.(McIntyre et al., 2005, p. 1043) The virus may be transmitted among rice rats through bites inflicted during fights. It is also present in rice rat saliva and urine and human infections may occur because of contact with these excreta.(McIntyre et al., 2005, p. 1048) Two related hantaviruses, virus and de Oro virus, are known from Oryzomys couesi in Honduras and western Mexico, respectively.(Milazzo et al., 2006, p. 1003; Chu et al., 2008, p. 188) An arenavirus normally associated with woodrats (Neotoma) has also been found in Florida marsh rice rats.(Kosoy et al., 1996, p. 574) Antibodies against burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes disease in the United States, have been found in marsh rice rats in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Tennessee.(Oliver et al., 1999, p. 578; Kollars et al., 1996, p. 130) Another pathogenic bacterium, Bartonella, is known from Georgia marsh rice rats.(Kosoy et al., 1997, table 2)The 2009 Red List assesses the conservation status of the marsh rice rat as Concern, because it is a common, widespread, and stable species without major threats that occurs in several areas.( The Florida Keys form is rare and in decline and is threatened by competition with the black rat, predation by domestic cats, habitat loss, and loss of genetic variation; it is considered endangered.(Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998, p. 278; Kays and Wilson, 2000, p. 108; Wang et al., 2005, pp. 575576, 581) At the northern edge of its distribution, the marsh rice rat is listed as threatened in Illinois(Hofmann et al., 1990, p. 162; Eubanks et al., 2011, p. 558) and whether it persists in Pennsylvania is unclear; it probably formerly occurred in tidal marshes on the River.(Merritt, 1987, p. 176) In Illinois, its population may have regenerated because wetlands have been developed to protect waterfowl and shorebirds and because suitable wetlands often develop in abandoned coal-mining operations.(Eubanks et al., 2011, pp. 558559) A 2001 study projected that change would reduce the range of the marsh rice rat in Texas,(Cameron and Scheel, 2001, table 3, pp. 668669) where it is now common but may become threatened by habitat loss in the future.(Schmidly and Davis, 2004, p. 382) A study at the Gaseous Diffusion Plant found that rice rats accumulate more PCBs but less heavy metal than white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus).(Smith et al., 2002, p. 261)FootnotesReferencesLiterature cited*Abuzeineh, A.A., Owen, R.D., McIntyre, N.E., Dick, C.W., Strauss, R.E. and Holsomback, T. 2007.

Tennessee_Dace
The Tennessee Dace (Chrosomus tennesseensis) is a species of fish in the Cyprinidae family. It is found only in the States; particularly in northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia,( and parts of extreme northwest Georgia.(http://www.cumberlandhcp.org/files/natureserve/Fish_10.23.08/Tennessee_Dace_10.13.08.pdf)  Until recently, they were considered a subspecies of mountain redbelly dace.( They are commonly found in East Tennessee in spring fed first-order streams, often in silt and fine gravel pools, or undercut banks.(Hamed, K. 2008. Life History Traits of the Tennessee Dace (Phoxinus tennesseensis) in Northeast Tennessee. The American Midland Naturalist. 160: 289299.) These streams usually do not exceed 2 meters in width.(Etnier, D. 1993. Fishes of Tennessee. 243248.)  Like all Tennessee species in the genus Chrosomus, Tennessee dace have tiny scales and scaled breasts.( They usually have scarlet bellies, and are considered some of the most beautiful native fish in Tennessee.( Tennessee dace are considered a nest associate spawner, using central stoneroller (anomalum) and common creek chub (atromaculatus) nests as spawning grounds.( There is evidence to suggest that the Tennessee dace can interbreed with the common creek chub.(Eisenhour, D. 1997. Two New Intergeneric Hybrids Involving Semotilus atromaculatus and the Genus Phoxinus with Analysis of Additional Semotilus atromaculatus: Phoxinus Hybrids. American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists. 1: 204209.) Spawning for Tennessee dace starts in April and extends into July.( Both males and females gain even more coloration during the breeding season.(Their diet is similar to that of other dace species, consisting mainly of attached algal growth.( Historically, Tennessee dace have only been found in 62 locations. Due to limited distribution and other factors, they are considered in need of management in Tennessee.(Hamed, K. 2001. Distribution of the Tennessee dace, Phoxinus tennesseensis, in northeast Tennessee. 80: 15.) Future threats include human development and climate change.Systematics and EtymologyChrosomus tennesseensis is a member of the same monophyletic group that contains cumberlandensis (mountain blackside dace), oreas (mountain redbelly dace) and saylori (laurel dace).( Until recently, the Tennessee dace was thought to be a variant of the mountain redbelly dace. However, morphological characteristics distinguish the two similar species. The Tennessee dace has a break in the dark lateral stripe that runs down the side of the body. Also, the Tennessee daces eye pupil diameter is larger than the diameter of the dark spots above the lateral stripe,( while the spots of oreas are larger than the pupil.( The oreas is a more robust minnow with fewer scales in the lateral series.( The species name tennesseensis means of Tennessee, which is a reference to the Tennessee River drainage encompassing much of its native range.(IdentificationThe Tennessee dace has a complete lateral line. Their dorsal coloration ranges from nearly plain olivaceous to profusely speckled with black. Nuptial males have red lower sides and bellies, with red scattered around the operculum, in the preorbital area, and at the base of the dorsal fin. The pectoral, pelvic, and anal fins are yellow, while the breast and lower head are black. Bright silver areas occur at the anterior base of the dorsal, pectoral and pelvic fins.( Tennessee dace exhibit dimorphism. Males have more rounded pectoral fins while females have narrower and more pointed fins.(Geographic DistributionThe Tennessee dace has an extremely limited distribution, as it is only found in eastern Tennessee, extreme southwestern Virginia,( and northwest Georgia.( Additionally, there are only 62 known populations.( Specifically, it occurs sporadically in small tributaries in the ridge and valley margins of the Blue Ridge and Cumberland Plateau provinces of the upper Tennessee drainage from Virginia southwestward. Watersheds include the Emory and lower Clinch river systems, and south to the River system.( They were likely extirpated from Whiteside, which is just west of Chattanooga.(EcologyHabitatThe Tennessee dace inhabits spring-fed, first order streams( that are usually less than two meters in length( and shaded by woody vegetation.( Woody vegetation often includes hemlock and rhododendron species.(Starnes L.B. and Starnes W.C. 1981. Biology of the Blackside Dace Phoxinus cumberlandensis. American Midland Naturalist. 106: 360-371) They prefer the ridge and valley limestone region.( In stream habitat includes  silt and fine gravel pools and undercut banks with woody debris and other material to serve as cover.( Studies conducted found that root masses and other woody vegetation is critical for the survival of the Tennessee dace. Adults use root masses as cover, and young-of-the-year are often found inside of root masses. Debris that falls into streams provides additional cover.(DietSimilar to other dace species, Tennessee dace feed on algal growth which is grazed from rocks and other debris on the stream bottom, and possibly beneath banks.( While they are grazing algae, they coincidentally ingest tiny sand particles. These sand grains rupture diatoms and other algal cells during digestion. This is an important aid to digestion, as the cell walls of plants are difficult for the fish enzymes to break down.( Additional nutrition may be obtained from both root hairs and bacteria associated with algal growth, and immature insects, which are consumed in the winter when algae supply is limited.( Dipteran and fly larvae make up most of their insect diet.(PredatorsLittle research has been done on Tennessee daces natural predators, but both mammals and birds have been known to feed on them in shallow pools.(Life HistoryTennessee dace spawn from April to July, and they have been found to spawn when water temperature were around 21C. They have the ability to spawn twice during this time period, but most only spawn once in their lifetime.( As with other Phoxinus species, spawning occurs in the afternoon on clear days.( The Tennessee dace has a law fecundity rate compared to similar species. Ova produced by females ranges from 398 to 721. This is considerably less than mountain blackside dace, which can produce close to 3,000 ova.(Breeding BehaviorMultiple male Tennessee dace have been observed following a single female through pool and run areas. In fact, as many as 20 have been observed following a single female. Males would form a straight line with the snout of one male just behind the caudal fin of the preceding male.( They have also been observed leaping out of the water one hour before and after spawning.(Nest AssociationTennessee dace are nest associate spawners, meaning they use nests already made by other species to spawn. They have been found to use the nests of common creek chub and central stoneroller.( If nests are not available, some Chrosomus species are thought to use shallow riffle areas in streams.( Being a nest associate spawner has benefits, such as physical protection provided by the nest, and protection provided by the host of the nest. However, nest association may contribute to species rarity. Several minnow species that are nest associate spawners  are protected on federal or state levels.( Tennessee dace initiate spawning as soon as the nest is vacated by the host, allowing them to spawn.( It has been hypothesized that a chemical cue from a nest building minnow may trigger Chrosomus species to spawn.(Hybridization with Semotilus atromaculatisNatural hybridization is relatively common among North American cyprinids, and this is the case of the Tennessee dace and the common creek chub. This hybridization likely occurs due to their similar breeding behaviors, such as communal use of gravel nests.( Degradation of streams is thought to increase the chance of hybridization, as this leaves a lack of clean gravel substrates needed for spawning.(Current ManagementCurrent ThreatsHuman DisturbancesHuman disturbance seems to be the greatest threat to the Tennessee dace. This is particularly true during the spawning season. Silt runoff and surface mining for coal have been known to increase siltation in streams.(Rakes, P.L. et al. 1999. Reproductive behavior, captive breeding, and restoration of endangered fishes. Environmental Biology of Fishes. 55: 31-42.) Observations have shown that eggs and embryos of the Tennessee dace are hidden in rock crevices for shelter. Because of this, they are high susceptible to being smothered by sediment.( Silt could also fill the small pools that Tennessee dace inhabit.( With such a limited range, inhabited streams need to be protected from runoff. Other human threats, such as channelization, removal of riparian cover, and impoundment also threaten the species.(DroughtPeriods of drought could threaten the fish. Small pools easily dry up during periods of warm weather.( Pool minimization also makes them more susceptible to avian and mammalian predators.( Because of these reasons, temperature change could become a problem in the future.Biological ThreatsThe low reproductive potential observed in the Tennessee dace is of particular importance. Most individuals only spawn once in their lifetime, and female fecundity is very low. Nest association may also contribute to species rarity. Several minnow species that are nest associate spawners  are protected on federal or state levels.(  Moreover, the Tennessee dace has been known to hybridize with the common creek chub. Hybridization between the two species has been known to increase if there is less spawning habitat due to stream degradation.( Increased hybridization could further decrease Tennessee dace populations in the future. Finally, the introduced mountain redbelly dace has a similar range and habitat. The Tennessee dace may be threatened by the competition with this introduced species.(ProtectionThe Tennessee Dace is listed as G3 (globally vulnerable to extirpation) and S3 (state vulnerable to extirpation and extinction).( It is listed as in need of management in Tennessee and endangered in Virginia.(Captive BreedingA similar species, the mountain blackside dace has been successfully bred in captivity at the Conservation Fisheries Inc. facility in Knoxville, Tennessee. Live specimens were captured and bred in aquariums. 8 females were placed in an aquarium with 12 males. The aquarium contained artificial chub nests to mimic natural conditions. Flowing water was directed over the nests to further mimic natural creek conditions. Pheromones from river chub and central stoneroller species were stripped into the aquarium to induce spawning. Spawning was successful, and eggs were removed from the tank and placed into incubation trays. Hatching was also successful.( The Tennessee dace could likely be reproduced in a similar fashion at Consevation Fisheries Inc.Management RecommendationsSampling MethodsFor future management purposes, further population monitoring needs to be conducted. In one study, a simple dip net was found to be the best method to collect Tennessee dace. They were very productive because the species usually inhabits very small streams. Dip nets can be placed at the down stream side of a pool, and moved to the upstream side.( In the larger pools and streams, a seine net was used. Seining was conducted using the standard seine method, blocking one end of a pool or sample area and kicking into the seine.( An electro shocker could be helpful in larger streams, but it is unnecessary in most streams.( In the same survey, minnow traps were used and proved ineffective. On separate occasions, both Tennessee dace and common creek chub were captured in minnow traps. Ten minutes later, the Tennessee dace were absent. It is assumed that they were consumed by the larger creek chub.(RecommendationsThe Tennessee dace would benefit from being reintroduced into Smoky Mountains National Park and other protected areas.( Fish reared at Conservation Fishereies Inc. would be good candidates to be reintroduced into protected streams. Land use practices (such as agriculture and human development) need to be reduced or eliminated around native streams. Simple tasks such as building siltation fences or planting riparion habitat around streams would reduce siltation. Lastly, mining near streams needs to be completely eliminated.References*(Source* Gimenez Dixon, M. 1996.  Phoxinus tennesseensis.   2011 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Lebanese_people_in_Sierra_Leone
related  diasporaThere is a significant population of Lebanese people in Sierra Leone.Migration historyLebanese immigrants first came to Africa in the mid-19th century when a silk-worm crisis struck their homeland, then part of the Empire; the first Lebanese arrived in Sierra Leone in 1893. The first groups were Christians, but beginning in 1903, Shia Muslim Lebanese began to arrive from Lebanon where there was an agricultural crunch.() They worked as small traders, at first occupying the same position in the economic structure as indigenous coastal traders.()Trade and employmentAt first, they had little access to capital and little control of import or export; they were at the mercy of the large colonial merchant firms, the same as indigenous traders.() They brought imported manufactured goods such as textiles, jewellery, and mirrors to rural areas where European and creole traders would not go, and traded them for local agricultural produce, primary kernels and nuts.()  As they expanded their trading interests into the interior, they gained some commercial power. However, they were blamed for a 1919 rice scarcity, and riots broke out against them in which their shops were looted.() Even the colonial authorities, traditionally seen as the patrons of the Lebanese, did not protect them; instead, they deported two Lebanese traders blamed for causing the shortages. This was one of the first major incidents that contributed to the Lebanese having a negative image in Sierra Leone.()In the 1920s, they not only began to enjoy better access to credit, but also began to play a role themselves in extending credit to agricultural producers in the interior, sometimes at exorbitant rates which sparked the intervention of the colonial government.() Beginning in the 1930s, the Lebanese began to outcompete indigenous traders, by concentrating their returns from commerce back into the same sector to expand their purchases of goods, rather than diversifying into other sectors. They also began to establish their own links to exporters in other countries.() The worldwide Depression actually strengthened their position, as smaller African-owned trading enterprises were hit the hardest.()During the same period, the discovery of diamonds at District in 1930 sparked the beginning of a major shift in the business activities of the Lebanese. The first Lebanese trader arrived in Kono soon after the discovery of diamonds, two years ahead of the British rulers. The establishment of the Leone Selection Trusts monopoly on diamond mining and export did little to stem their involvement in the diamond trade; many Lebanese traders were deported in the 1940s for illicit diamond trading. By the 1950s, diamonds had become the most important business sector for Lebanese traders. Throughout the 1950s, they continued their diamond smuggling, mainly to Liberia; as many as 20% of diamonds on the world market may have passed through the hands of Lebanese and Madingo traders in Sierra Leone and Liberia.()However, the Lebanese are not solely active in the diamond sector; they also operate cinemas, hotels, casinos, factories, and travel agencies. From 1963 to 1971, there was even a short-lived Lebanese-owned bank, the Intra Bank.()Notable peopleThere are five key Lebanese families in Sierra Leone, who had largely consolidated their position by the 1970s; most Lebanese prominent in trade in the country and its neighbours have some connection to them.()FootnotesBibliography****Further reading***

Bockau
Bockau is a community in the district of Erzgebirgskreis in the Free State of Saxony in Germany. The community is known for growing and researching herbs. Owing to its centuries-old cultivation of angelica, whose roots are used in making liqueurs, Bockau is also known locally by the nickname Wurzelbucke (Wurzel is German for root). Geography  Location The place lies in the western Ore Mountains in a sheltered hollow in a side valley off the Zwickauer Mulde valley, stretching up to the Ochsenkopf bei Jgerhaus, an 823-m-high mountain. Neighbouring communities Bordering on Bockau are Aue, Lauter, Schwarzenberg, Sosa and Zschorlau. History In the late 15th century, farmers began gathering medicinal herbs from meadows and woods and to ply a trade with them. Important to the herbal lore were, among others, spignel, lovage, angelica, valerian and rhubarb. From the roots essential oils they mixed medicinal tinctures, essences and pills. Not least of all, they burnt schnaps. The research establishment grew out of this. Later, herbs were grown in dedicated fields, with angelica plants even being grown as late as 1989. The roots were exported to several European countries and overseas. With the changes in the Bloc, local herb growers were left to themselves and their herbs.A long tradition was threatening to wither and die. Since that time, many in Bockau have been growing the herbs in their gardens and never tire of telling of the valuable angelica roots medicinal properties or of using them for their health.Drawn by the groer Berggeschrey (Great Call of the Mountains) to the Ore Mountains in the 16th century (silver, tin, cobalt, white earth and gravel mining), many settlers came here from the Mountains and found a new home. Bockau received status as a mining area, comparable to status as a mining town, although Bockau was not actually considered a town. Specialists and academics, too, settled here.  In 1750, Gottlieb Lorenz introduced vitriolic acid distilling into Bockau. From gravelly ores mined in the area, such as pyrite, which yield sulphur salts (vitriol) came, after weeks of heating and cooking in stone vats, concentrated acid, also called vitriolic acid. This was put to use in medicine and was an important raw material for both inorganic and organic chemistry. About 1760 there were already 7 vitriol plants in town, and by 1812 there were 24 distilleries in operation. Important sidelines for the farmers were tree felling, charcoal making, resin harvesting (this was limited by decree to a patch of the woods known as the Harzweide, or resin meadow, to prevent widespread damage to the foresthttp://www.beerheide.net/home/geschichte.htmhttp://www.wanderer-familie.de/html/genealogie.html) and driving.Even cobalt ore was a raw material for a new branch of industry. Peter Weidkammer, a man from Franconia, succeeded in 1520 in making a dye out of it. However, it was only after about 100 years that the Saxon Elector Johann Georg I allowed the founding of several dyemills. Erasmus Schindler secured approval in 1649 to build one of the five great dyeworks in the Ore Mountains.The blue dye made from the ore was used for colouring both glass and enamel, for ceramic glazing and later for painting porcelain. For Saxonys economy, this dye was an important export item. When the Aue-Adorf railway line was built in 1875, the dyeworks succeeded in having the foreseen station for Bockau built right near the works, thereby significantly improving transport conditions. When King of Saxony visited the community on 7 July 1880, the factorys reputation was enhanced. The mining industrys heyday stretched into the 19th century.Even in Bockau, the Years War wrought its wrath. In 1632 Bockau was sacked by Heinrich von Holks troops. In 1633, 108 of the communitys 500 inhabitants lost their lives to the plague. The Swedes brought much wretchedness to the mountains; in 1640 alone, 6 Bockauers were murdered by them.The year 1678 was a very important one for Bockau, as it was then that it became an independent parish. The Baroque church that stands today had however already been consecrated in 1637.In 1747, Master George (or Georg) Krner became the church minister in Bockau. He was a chronicler and a linguist as well as the founder of the Bockauer jhrliche Nachrichten (Bockau Yearly News). George Krners work lives on in the club Magister George Krner Gesellschaft e.V.  at the Krner Haus together with a German-Czech meeting centre.The nineteenth century brought Bockau new kinds of livelihood, while the traditional herbal industry fell ever more by the wayside owing to modern medicine and pharmacy. Basketweaving from spruce splints became an outgrowth of boxmaking.Glovemaking and the introduction of metalworking at the die and enamel works brought further employment and earnings. The first clubs came into being, among them the sport club, founded in 1869, the marksmens club, founded in 1871, the poultry raisers club, founded in 1872, the Erzgebirgszweigverein (Ore Mountain Branch Club), founded in 1888, and also the volunteer brigade, founded in 1867.Workers also now worked in the neighbouring areas around Bockau, also in Aue, Schwarzenberg and Lauter. Political parties and unions were organized. Many people fell victim to the two world wars. A calming and hopeful beacon throughout these troubled times was the Evangelical Lutheran Church.In 1886 and 1887, the current school was built. Under the auspices of the workers club, gymnastics club and sport club, the outdoor pool and the sporting ground were realized.In 1950 came the merger of three small liqueur distilleries into todays Erzgebirgische Destillerie und Liqueurmanufaktur GmbH Bockau. In 1964, the groundwork was laid for todays school.Already by 1900, Bockau had become known to Saxon citydwellers as a summer health resort. They came from Leipzig, Zwickau and elsewhere, travelling comfortably by rail. There were plenty of rental rooms and inns in Bockau and its environs. This development continued after the World War. In 1965, Bockau became a state-recognized health resort (Erholungsort), a title that todays Bockauers still value. There came company holiday homes, and the local holiday services offered holidaymakers a varied programme, changed every fortnight, during their stay.In the postwar years, when many people began to think, looking back on the war, that there must be a better way than wars and racial hatred, there arose the idea of friendly partnerships between towns in one country or in different nations. In 1957, the World Federation of Partner Towns was founded. Thus also arose the wish in Bockau to have some kind of partnership with what was then Germany.Through the Bockau master joiner Werner Teubners family ties with Werner Herzog, the mayor of Herrieden, a small town in Franconia, then part of West Germany, the first contacts were established. On 3 October 1990  the day of Reunification  the partnership document was signed. At this time, Herrieden already had a partnership arrangement with the Austrian town of Melk. This was also the basis for establishing ties with that town on the Danube at the entrance to the picturesque Wachau.Club life almost died out in the time when Bockau found itself in Germany. It only revived in the 1990s after the political changes wrought by Reunification. Until that time there had simply been interest associations, above all in the field of sport. As of 1990, former clubs had new life breathed into them, and new members joined.Nowadays, the clubs, with their events, participate fully in the communitys varied, active life, whereby several activities have already become traditional, among them the yearly Buchberglauf (Buchberg Walk) in February, the Angelika-Cross-Lauf held yearly on 3 October, the yearly Wurzelfest (Root Festival) with its election of the Wurzelknigin (Root Queen) on the third weekend in August and the Bockauer Kirmes on the first Sunday in November. All these festivals enjoy great popularity and draw many visitors.Over the last few years, great pains have been undertaken to offer industrial operations and crafts new locations for expansion, to maintain and improve the communitys economic structure. In connection with the European initiative for rural reform, it is the communitys wish to have a commercial-industrial area built by attracting investment in the near future to develop the 8.5 ha site where once stood the old paper factory. To avoid demand for meadowland, it is important to clean up old industrial sites so that they can be used by new operations and services. This is a meaningful process for the further development of the Naturpark Erzgebirge/Vogtland, and it could also contribute to mitigating the whole problem of economic and social problems.On 13 April 1930, a university student from Leipzig named Elisabeth Charlotte Mller fell victim to a violent crime in the woods next to the road between Bockau and Jgerhaus. Her murderer, Willy Leischke, was caught, but killed himself in prison. At the scene of the crime, a memorial stone was laid. The event occupied the population and the daily press for months.

Cutaway_drawing
Nash Ambassador X-ray.jpg|thumb|320px|A cutaway drawing of a 1942 Nash AmbassadorA cutaway drawing, also called a cutaway diagram is a graphics, drawing, diagram and or illustration, in which surface elements a three-dimensional model are selectively removed, to make internal features visible, but without sacrificing the outer context entirely. Overview Image:Yusupersonik.jpg|thumb|left|A Avion cutaway drawingAccording to Diepstraten et al. (2003) the purpose of a cutaway drawing is to allow the viewer to have a look into an otherwise solid opaque object. Instead of letting the inner object shine through the surrounding surface, parts of outside object are simply removed. This produces a visual appearance as if someone had cutout a piece of the object or sliced it into parts. Cutaway illustrations avoid ambiguities with respect to spatial ordering, provide a sharp contrast between foreground and background objects, and facilitate a good understanding of spatial ordering.( J. Diepstraten, D. Weiskopf & T. Ertl (2003). Interactive Cutaway Illustrations. in: Eurographics 2003. P. Brunet and D. Fellner (ed). Vol 22 (2003), Nr 3.)Though cutaway drawing are not dimensioned manufacturing blueprints, they are meticulously drawn by a handful of devoted artists who either had access to manufacturing details or deduced them by observing the visible evidence of the hidden skeleton (e.g. rivet lines, etc.). The goal of this drawings in studies can be to identify common design patterns for particular vehicle classes. Thus, the accuracy of most of these drawings, while not 100 percent, is certainly high enough for this purpose.(Mark D. Sensmeier, and Jamshid A. Samareh (2003). A Study of Vehicle Structural Layouts in Post-WWII Aircraft Paper American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.)The technique is used extensively in design, see first image. It has also been incorporated into the interface of some games. In Sims, for instance, users can select through a control panel whether to view the house they are building with no walls, cutaway walls, or full walls.( ) History File:Fire-setting.jpg|thumb|An engraving by Agricola illustrating the mining practice of fire-settingThe cutaway view and the view were minor graphic inventions of the Renaissance that also clarified pictorial representation. This cutaway view originates in the early fifteenth century notebooks of Marino Taccola (1382  1453). In the 16th century cutaway views in definite form were used in Agricolas (1494-1555) mining book Re Metallica to illustrate underground operations. (Eugene S. Ferguson (1999). Engineering and the Minds Eye. p.82.) The 1556 book is a complete and systematic treatise on mining and extractive metallurgy, illustrated with many fine and interesting woodcuts which illustrate every conceivable process to extract ores from the ground and metal from the ore, and more besides. It shows the many watermills used in mining, such as the machine for lifting men and material into and out of a mine shaft, see image.The term Cutaway drawing was already in use in the 19th century but, became popular in the 1930s. Technique The location and shape to cut the outside object depends on many different factors, for example:(* the sizes and shapes of the inside and outside objects, * the semantics of the objects, * personal taste, etc. These factors, according to Diepstraten et al. (2003), can seldon be formalized in a simple algorithm, But the properties of cutaway can be distinguish in two classes of cutaways of a drawing:(* cutout : illustrations were the cutaway is retricted to very simple and regularly shaped of often only a small number of planar slices into the outside object.* breakaway : a cutaway realized by a single hole in the outside object. Examples Some more examples of cutaway drawings, from products and systems to architectural building.

Thurcroft
 Thurcroft is a village and parish situated southeast of Rotherham in the Borough of Rotherham in Yorkshire, England. From 1902 to 1991, it was a close-knit, mining community.  It has a population of 5,296.(Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Rotherham Retrieved 2009-08-28)The village has seen great changes and re-generation since the pit closed down.  It had a devastating effect on the community as a whole and since a lot of families have moved out of the village.  Recent re-generation has taken place from the local council and now the housing has increased with new housing estates being built on the old pit site.The old colliery site and the pit tip have now been renovated into large grass planes and show no sign of what they once were.FacilitiesThurcroft has a number of schools, pubs, a snooker club, a cricket club, five take-a-ways, car spares shop, a garage, a DIY shop, a charity shop, the Gordon Bennett Memorial Hall, a pharmacy, a bookmaker, an off licence, a butcher, a beauty parlour, a Dance Wear and Fancy Dress Shop (Performers Unlimited), four hairdressers, a traditional sweet shop, a Deli, a Kitchen shop, three newsagents, and two medium sized supermarkets, the SPAR, and the Co-Op. There is also a gymnasium, in the old chapel and an auction hall, which used to be a cinema many years ago. Also in Thurcroft is a large shoe shopping centre, Wyndsor World of Shoes. In addition, an independent free church, Thurcroft Christian Fellowship (TCF CHURCH).HistoryThe name Thurcroft has Norse (Viking) roots as thorr means thunder in old Norse, so is probably at least a thousand years old.Until the 20th century Thurcroft consisted of Thurcroft Hall, the longtime holding of the Mirfin family, and three other farms. Thurcroft Hall was held by the Mirfin (sometimes spelled Mirfield) until 1644 when Robert Mirfin, the lord of the manor, died childless. The property then was carried into the Beckwith family by his widowwho also happened to be his stepsister. The MIrfields and the Levetts of nearby High Melton were interrelated, Thomas Levett having married Robert Mirfins sister Elizabeth.(Mirfin/Myrfin of Slade Hooton, Thurcroft, Brookhouse, Thurcroft Web, thurcroftweb.co.uk)Todays Thurcroft is very different from its medieval antecedents. Todays town was largely shaped by 20th century coal mining.Coal miningThe land on which the village would one day stand was bought in the 1800s (along with the Hall) by a Sheffield brewer (Thomas Marrian), whose son, Thomas Marrian Jr, leased the coal mining rights to Vale Collieries in 1902. Modern Thurcroft only really came into being with the sinking of the coal mine in around 1909. Many of the terraced houses on the area showed characteristics of coal mining in the last quarter of the 19th century and first quarter of the 20th century. The population grew from next to nothing in 1900 to around 2,000 in 1923: Shortly after which the village saw hard times in the 1926 coal strike, when 250,000 free meals were given out between May and September. By 1947 the mine employed over 2,000 men, and in the 1984/85 miners strike was once again in the thick of the action.The coal mine was closed in Thurcroft in 1991 despite attempts by the workforce to buy it out.Church and parishBefore 1995 Thurcroft was within the parish of Laughton-en-le-Morthen and a permanent stone church was only built in 1937, making it one of the newest on this site (although there was a Methodist chapel built in 1917, and a village cemetery was established in the 1920s). Thurcroft parish became separate from Laughton in 1995.The old Catholic Church is now home to TCF Church.ReferencesExternal links*History of Thurcroft, Timeline, Thurcroftweb*Thurcroft Top Club F.C.it:Thurcroftnl:Thurcroftpl:Thurcroft

Minerals yields are determined by lunar height, terrain type, quality of mining gear, and amount of minerals previously discovered.Mining Robot SubsystemUp to seven Mining robots can be purchased to assist the Miner in finding minerals.  These robots can be enhanced by upgrades and enhancements, which make them mine faster, yield more minerals, communicate to other bots, return to base, and intelligently avoid poor mining zones.  Upgrades are either found by working with other Non-Player Characters, or by completing real-world science lessons at the Lunar Academy computer terminal.Economic SubsystemAn economic subsystem provides an advanced economy based on multiple types of minerals.  Prices fluctuate over time in response to supply and demand, and factor into player missions.  This economic subsystem is handled through the Yack conversation system built for the Torque Gaming Engine.

Jim_B._Taylor
James Benjamin Taylor aka Jim B. Taylor (December 1860 Town  25 December 1944 Cape Town), was a South African Randlord and the fifth of 8 children of Isaac Rowland Taylor (6 November 1826 Holborn - 22 August 1888 Kimberley) and Jane Dorothea Hellet (7 May 1827 - 27 November 1876).  He was married in Johannesburg on 10 March 1891 to Mary Mollie Gordon (*August 1863 Ballater, Scotland), daughter of a Pietermaritzburg physician. They produced a family of 4 children:#Alfred Gordon Taylor (*1892)#Frances Daphne Taylor (*1895)#Iris Dorothea Taylor (*1903 - 5 September 1973) x Lt.-Col. Harold Boyd-Rochfort (The Peerage)#Lance Taylor (*1905)Jim Taylor followed the normal route to great wealth - diamonds in Kimberley, gold in Barberton and Pilgrims Rest and ending up on the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. His ability to speak Afrikaans was instrumental in his rise to wealth and power, and he became a confidant of President Kruger of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek. He acted as intermediary between the Government and the mining industry, and was privy to many of the political machinations leading to the Raid and the War.His first formal education was at Dalton School in Cape Town. Taylor was present when in 1867 Prince Alfred, son of Victoria, called at the Cape aboard the screw frigate Galatea (1859-1883) on his voyage around the world. Taylors father and brother moved to Du Toits Pan, later called Kimberley in 1870 when news of the diamond find spread, and the following year the family joined them, travelling from Cape Town on a mule wagon, a journey that took a month. Taylor and his brother Bill spent the next few years labouring with their parents while they worked the claim. It was during this period that he first met Rhodes, who had contracted to pump water from Baxters Gully close to the Taylor diggings. The increasing depth of the diggings coupled with the hard blue layers encountered in the kimberlite pipes, discouraged a lot of miners from continuing. This together with the falling price of diamonds, led to extensive selling of the claims to the larger syndicates. This consolidation gave rise to the growth in power and wealth of Rhodes, Barnato and Beit.Jim Taylors lack of schooling was a cause for concern with his parents, so that in 1873 he was sent to Greytown in Natal to further his education. His uncle Peter Hellet, a sibling of Taylors mother, lived in Greytown and it was felt that he could offer the necessary substitute for parental care. Taylor was accordingly enrolled at the German mission school at Hermannsburg. Holidays were spent with his relatives, the Menne family who owned a swath of land along the Umvoti River. Peter Hellet died in 1874 cutting short Taylors planned education and forcing his return to Kimberley. The Taylor family ran into financial difficulties, and Jim Taylor found a job as assistant bookkeeper with the firm of E.W. Tarry.In 1878 Taylor accompanied a trader Finnaughty on a trip to Kuruman and beyond. On returning to Kimberley he volunteered to join the Kimberley Artillery to subdue two Griqua chiefs whose followers had been murdering and plundering in the country around the Langeberg Mountains near Griquatown. This they managed with the help of the Kimberley Light Horse and the Kimberley Infantry. In 1879, having acquired a taste for exploration, Taylor joined Gus Fisher, a retired naval officer, on a journey to Spelonken in the Transvaal.Piet Buyskes, a noted lawyer of the period, invited Taylor along on a trip to hear the grievances of Gasibone, a chief of the Batlapin or Tlhaping tribe and to relay these grievances to the British government. Kruger on hearing about this, invited Buyskes to hear his own grievances against the Cape government in connection with the annexation of the Transvaal, which he also wanted communicated to London. They met Kruger near Rustenburg and Taylor was present when they appointed a committee charged with having the independence of the Transvaal restored.On Taylors return to Kimberley, he took his first steps in diamond broking by joining Beit, a partner of Porgs. Alfred Beit was at that time the leading diamond merchant in Kimberley and had established a reputation for being scrupulously fair in all his business dealings. However, he fell under the spell of Rhodess imperial vision, whereas his partner Wernher did not.Taylors brother Bill went to London in 1880 to establish an agency. Jim Taylor followed a year later, visiting his ancestral country for the first time, and taking the opportunity of doing the Tour. He returned to Kimberley in 1882 to find that a slumping market had financially crippled him.Family#Johan Pieter Hellet (12.10.1790 Regenswalde, Prussia - 4.12.1840 (Retired captain of a British ship) x 11 March 1821 Maria Cornelia Bandel (12.5.1806 - 2.4.1892) ##Johanna Wilhelmina Gertrude Hellet x 1844 Theodore Menne (1813-1905) (born in Germany, settled near Greytown - was owner of the farm Cedara, built Menneheim)###Maria Wilhelmina Menne *1845###Jane Aletta Menne *1847###Peter Anton Menne *1849###Theodore Menne *1850###Wilhelmina Martha (Mina) Menne (1852-1880)###Johanna Gertrude (Annie) Menne *1854 x James Egner####Theodore Egner####Ethel Egner####Theresa (Trixie) Egner####Colenso Egner####Kathleen Egner####Robert (Jumbo) Egner####Chieveley Egner####Irene Egner####Annie Egner###Joseph Charles Menne (1855-1931) x Martha Aletta Louisa Mare####Louisa Martha (Lulu) Menne *1886 x Johan Havemann####Victor Theodore Menne (1888-1913)####Juana (Johanna) Menne *1892 x van Rooyen####Durand Paul Menne *1895 x M Maritz####Charles Joseph Menne *1897 x E Makkink####Magdalena Letitia Menne *1903 x Charles Juckes####Martha Elizabeth Menne *1906 x Jan Vivier###Anton Ro(w)land Menne *1856 x Ada Browning###Moran Menne *1857 x Dorothy Pringle####Alme Menne x Rottcher####Kinley Menne x Gladys Kelper####Eula Menne x Taylo####Blythe Menne x Helen Wood####Robus Menne x Alexia Oellermann####Roa Menne x Kenny###Marianna (Minnie) Menne *1858 x Tom Brown###Francis Charles (Frank) Menne *1859 x Elizabeth Cookley####Doreen x H Clarke ####Gertrude Menne x Tony Tanzer####William Menne x Rosemary ####Letitia Menne x Ian Torrance####Elizabeth Menne x F Donaldson####Theodore Menne x Louise van Dooren###Anna Sophya (Bertie) Menne (1864-1912)###Hendrika Caroline (Dixie) Menne *1866 x Thomas L Handley####Dora Handley####Justin Handley####Sybil Handley####Iris Handley###Daniel Brink Menne *1866 x Elizabeth Baker####Briton Menne x Mary Handley####Saxon Menne x Olive (Polly) Owen####Norman Menne x Stella Gunning####Olive Menne x Chris Carstens##William Hellet##Jane Dorothea Hellet (7.5.1827-27.11.1876 x Isaac Rowland Taylor##Peter Jurgen Ellis Hellet (28.4.1831-13.5.1874) x (21.12.1863 Greytown) Anna Johanna Botha *27.9.1847 Greytown (sister of Botha)###Louis Hellet *17.8.1865###Maria Hellet *16.6.1867###Theodore Hellet *23.11.1869###Menne Hellet *24.5.1872##Hendrika Hellet x Isaac Rowland TaylorSources*Menne family*Hellet family*Botha familyReferences*JB Taylor Lucky Jim - Memoirs of a Randlord  (Stonewall Books, Cape Town 2003) ISBN 0-620-29508-2
